"Pardies, Ignace Gaston","A Latin Letter written to the Publisher April 9. 1672. n. st. by Ignatius Gaston Pardies P. Prof. of the Mathematicks in the Parisian Colledge of Clermont, containing some Animadversions upon Mr. Isaac Newton, Prof. of the Mathematicks in the University of Cambridge, his Theory of Light, printed in N.° 80.","Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 7/84, 4087–90",1672,London,Martyn,17th century,"Letter, Review",Physics,A Latin Letter(JSTOR),607720,"In Feburary of 1672,Isaac Newtonpublished his groundbreaking new theory about light and colours, in anEnglish paperin the 80th issue of thePhilosophical Transactions(p. 3075–87). In this scientific paper styled as a letter, Newton accounts how through his experiments with glass prisms, he came to the conclusion that white light consisted of spectral colours each of which was differently refrangible. However, Newton's theory was soon opposed, most notably by Robert Hooke andChristiaan Huygens, but also by the Parisian Jesuit and professor of mathematics Ignace Pardies, who wrote two letters on Newton's theory of light. This is the second of Pardies' letters, a short Latin text addressed to the editor of thePhilosophical TransactionsHenry Oldenburg. As on of the first reactions to Newton's theory of light and colours, it was written in April in the same year of 1672 and published in the 84th issue of the journal together withNewton's response, which was written in Latin as well.Although in reality this was a scientific discussion between Pardies and Newton, both their letters are fashioned as conversations with the editor Henry Oldenburg about Newton's theory of light and colour. Thus, Pardies' letter starts:Legi ingeniosissimam hypothesin de lumine et coloribus clarissimi Newtoni. Et quia nonnullam ego operam dedi in ista contemplatione ac experimentis peragendis, perscribam ad te pauca, quae mihi circa novam istam doctrinam occurrerunt. (""I read the most ingenious hypothesis about light and colour by the most famous Newton. And since I myself made some efforts in thinking it through and conducting the experiments, I will write to you a few things that came to my mind about this new doctrine."") Although disagreeing with Newton's theory, Pardies is very polite in his letter, calling Newton's theoryingeniosissimaand Newton himself bothclarissimusanderuditissimus. As it is printed, the letter lacks asalutatioorconclusioto the addressee Oldenbourg, but gets straight to the point of Newton's theory of colours, which is first briefly introduced and then discussed in detail.Pardies first provides a Latin summary of Newton's theory of light and colours and procedes to raise his points of criticism: Newton's hypothesis of light, while relying wholly on one prism experiment, would radically change the whole fundaments of optics and renders the traditional practice useless (dioptricae fundamenta evertit, praxesque hactenus institutas inutiles reddit, p. 4087). Instead, Pardies argues that Newton's observation that light passing through a glass prism acquired an oblong instead of a circular shape can still be explained according to the established rules of optics (iuxta communes et receptas dioptricae leges, p. 4087) and does not require the different refrangibility of rays within white light. In the main part of the letter, Pardies tries to prove his claim by means of a geometric-mathematical argumentation, which is supported by a diagram. On the last page, Pardies turns to the idea of different colours coexisting within white light, an idea that was hard to imagine and seemed to contradict experience: while this idea follows perfectly from Newton's hypothesis, Pardies says, colours are not able to blend into something white, but only into something dark, as can be observed in painting colours.The letter by Pardies is evidence that Newton's paper on the theory of light and colours, though printed in English, led to an international scientific discussion that was at least partially conducted and printed in Latin. Although the principal language of publication and scientific discourse in thePhilosophical Transactionswas English, not only was Pardies' letter printed in the journal in its original Latin, but, crucially, Newton felt compelled to respond in Latin, too.","Harmon; Gross 2007, 22–5","Pardies, Ignace Gaston‎(← links)Mr. Newtons Letter, being an Answer to the Letter of P.

The second, updated and expanded edition, on which the present entry is based, appeared five years later as an appendix to the definitive edition of the author'sΟΥΡΕΣΙΦΟΙΤΗΣ (Ouresiphoites) Helveticus. In fact, the first version is even referenced in the second (p. 635).The strange titleAcarnaniais derived from Scheuchzer's name as a member of the Academia Caesareo-Leopoldina Naturae Curiosorum, Acarnan (presumably derived in turn from the rare Greek word ἄκαρνα /ákarna, ""laurel"") and means something like ""things (written) by Acarnan"". The text, which fills 27 quarto pages, enumerates all printed works and (towards the end) manuscripts produced by Scheuchze so far in roughly chronological order, usually with their full bibliographical data. This is only partly done in the form of a dry list. Much of the bibliographic material is accompanied by additional information regarding the author's intentions and the circumstances of production and publication. Scheuchzer's presence in the text makes itself strongly felt. Speaking in the first person throughout and commenting on his own career, character, and interests, he gives the reader a guided tour, so to speak, through his life andOpera omnia.Although Scheuchzer protests in the first sentence that the bibliographynon encomium spirat, (""has not the flavour of an encomium""), the work is in fact quite openly self-promotional. Scheuchzer does much to present his personality and achievements in a favourable light. Outspoken self-praise occurs as early as the first page (p. 609), where one learns that he is indifferent to financial gain and a born discoverer:… a tenera iuventute terras quaesivi vel incognitas vel parum tritas, nova sulcavi maria vel parum frequentata, labores amavi, observationes, nullis parcendo sumptibus(""… already as a tender youth, I looked for unknown or little wandered lands, sailed new or little visited seas, loved to toil and to observe and spared no expenses""). Time and again, his passion for knowledge and readiness to make sacrifices to this end are highlighted. An p. 622, he tells of the plants collected by him for a future Swiss floraincredibili … voluptate, sed et labore … in summitatibus ipsarum Alpium(""with incredible … pleasure, but toil as well … on the very summits of the Alps""). The plant species amassed by him number no less than 1900 (p. 621). In general, figures are freely adduced to highlight Scheuchzer's industriousness: 3863 place names in his map of Switzerland (p. 628), 1513 items in his personal collection of diluvial remains (p. 630), and so on. Alongside such self-praise, other people's favourable opinions are gladly quoted as well, as in the case of a letter extolling Scheuchzer'sPiscium querelae et vindiciae(p. 625). His good connections in the academia are paraded in the form of a long list of English colleagues, most of them from the Royal Society, who financed the copper engravings in the 1708 edition of hisOuresiphoites(pp. 624–25).Much can be learned from the text about Scheuchzer's life and works as well as about scientific writing and publishing around 1700 in general. Scheuchzer candidly tells of the failure of hisCharta invitatoria,  explains his aims and problems as the founder and editor of theNova Litteraria Helvetica(pp. 613–15) and provides insights into different divisions of labour betweenpraesesand defendant in the preparation of adisputatio(p. 612). In this context, he reveals that he is in fact the main author of the very first scientific treatise on crystallography,Κρυσταλλολογία(Krystallologia, 1698) commonly attributed to Johann Heinrich Hottinger, although ""the defendant added something to my efforts as well"" (p. 612). One also learns about the dissensions that could arise with regard to mottos and titles of publications (pp. 609–10 and 623, where Scheuchzer proclaims himself a hater of overlong titles,sesquipedalium titulorum osor). Speaking of hisBibliotheca scriptorum historiae naturali omnium terrae regionum inservientium(1716), the author shows himself keenly aware that such a bibliography is a never-ending work in progress (opus novis semper accessionibus augendum, p. 629).",,"Charta invitatoria‎(← links)ΟΥΡΕΣΙΦΟΙΤΗΣ (Ouresiphoites) Helveticus‎(← links)Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob‎(← links)Bibliotheca scriptorum historiae naturali omnium terrae regionum inservientium‎(← links)Ephemerides aëris perpetuae‎(← links)ΚΡΥΣΤΑΛΛΟΛΟΓΙΑ seu Dissertatio de crystallis‎(← links)","Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob:Acarnania, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Acarnania(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,
"Morabito, Giuseppe",Ad astronautas Americanos carmen Iosephi Morabito in certamine poetico Hoeufftiano magna laude ornatum,"Fons pacis. Nova aetas. Ad astronautas Americanos. Iuvenalis saturae XVI fragmentum nuperrime repertum. Carmina certaminis poetici Hoeufftiani, p. 32–37",1969,Amsterdam,Nord-Hollandsche Uitgevers Maatschapij,After 1800,Panegyric poem,Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Download PDF(Transcript),not available,"As late as the 20th century, the imagination of Neo-Latin poets could be kindled by the scientific and technological advances of their day. In 1968, the Italian Neo-Latin poet Giuseppe Morabito composed anOde to the American Astronauts. In 29 Alcaic stanzas, it sings about the flight ofApollo 8(21st–27th December 1968), the first spacecraft to reach and orbit the Moon. At the end of the text, Morabito states that he wrote the poem on 26th December 1968, thus styling it as an immediate poetic reaction to the pioneering feat of the three astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and Bill Anders. When the poem was submitted in 1969 to the Certamen Hoeufftianum, the most prestigious award of Neo-Latin poetry in its time, it received amagna lausand was subsequently published in the annual publication of the competition (p. 32–37).In the first two stanzas (1-2), the poet revels in the invention of space travel, portrayed as a feat of the human mind, hard work and love of infinity. The following two stanzas (3-4) reveal the concrete occasion for this feeling of pride: the far side of the Moon has been observed for the first time. The poem then switches into a narrative mode, telling the story of the daring voyage of the astronauts: the ascent into space (st. 5-8), the communications with the mission control center (st. 9-10), and, in the form of a prolepsis, the taking of theEarthrise picture(Terram homini retegat remoto, st. 11) and the jocular announcement that the astronauts had seen Santa Claus (st. 12). In the next two stanzas (13-14), the tempo of the narrative is slowed down as the flight arrives at the critical moment of entering the lunar orbit. Once the space craft orbits the moon, the narrative makes way for a vivid and emotionally charged depiction of the far side of the moon (st. 15-19): compared to these lifeless wastelands, the Earth appears to be a garden given by God (based on a quote by Lovell, st. 20). In an apostrophe to Anders (st. 21), the poet refers to the astronaut's reading of the first verses ofGenesisduring theApollo 8 Christmas Eve Broadcast. The following stanzas then open a window into the future and express the wish that another mission will land on the Moon and bring moon rocks back to Earth (st. 22-24). At the end, the poem returns to the heroic tone of the opening stanzas, reflecting on the human inclination to perform great and daring deeds, exemplified in the journeys of Jason, Daedalus and Columbus (st. 25-27). These three voyagers of the past are now surpassed by the three astronauts Lovell, Anders and Borman, who are exalted as the first men to orbit the Moon and to pave the way into space (st. 28-29).The choice of the Alcaic stanza, which already suggests a serious and grand topic, is matched by the heroic (and sometimes moralizing) tone of the ode.Themodel for lyric poetry in Latin is Horace, and he is clearly marked as such in the opening lineHumana mens, nunc sume superbiam!(""Take pride now, human mind!""), which echoes a line in Horace'scarmen3.30, the poem in which Horace confidently proclaims that he had completed a monument more lasting than bronze. Centered on a heroic narrative, Morabito's ode creates atmospheric pictures of space and the Moon, dwells on anecdotes from the flight and evokes a feeling of religious awe. However, it also captures the state of science and engineering at its time, praising space travel in very familiar terms as the product ofingenium,laborandamor.When Morabito wrote hisOde to the American Astronauts, a Neo-Latin poem could no longer expect a wide readership. The ode was printed a second time in Morabito's own collectionLatina fides(p. 169–172) of 1979, but apart from a small circle of connoisseurs, this unique literary reaction to the Apollo program remained largely unknown.","Giustiniani 1979, 108 (list of award-winning poems at the Certamen Hoeufftianum);Wiegand 1984, 39;Stroh 1999, 116","Morabito, Giuseppe‎(← links)","Morabito, Giuseppe:Ad astronautas Americanos, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ad_astronautas_Americanos(last revision: 23.02.2022).","The Earthrise picture and ""Please be informed that there is a Santa Claus"" (apparently a code that everything was alright with the spacecraft) are both attributed to Borman in the poem, but the picture was taken by Anders and the Santa Claus quote comes from Lovell.Reread st. 23.",IT,,IT,

In one elegiac couplet, Lipsius playfully renames the scientist: Since he unlocks (recludere) all secrets of nature, he is to Lipsius no more Clusius (a name which is connected toclaudere""to close"", ""to lock""), but Aperta (a name which is connected toaperire, ""to open""):Omnia naturae dum, Clusi, arcana recludis,Clusius haud ultra sis, sed Aperta, mihi.As a marginal note to the poem explains, Aperta is a learned allustion to an ancient name of the god Apollo, thereby linking Clusius, the ""new Aperta"", to the divine sphere.Lipsius' epigram was printed twice in the paratext to Clusius' books, first inRariorum stirpium per Pannoniam et Austriam observatarum historia, then some twenty years later inExoticorum libri decem, this time occupying an entire page. In 1642, it was included in a collection of famous two-liners (Epigrammata disticha poetarum Latinorum veterum et recentum nobiliora, p. 60). One century later, in 1739, it was cited in the entry on Clusius in theBibliotheca Belgica(tom. 1, pp. 150-1), testifying to the long lasting fame of Lipsius' epigram.","Ogilvie 2011, 28-9","Rariorum stirpium per Pannoniam et Austriam observatarum historia‎(← links)Lipsius, Justus‎(← links)","Lipsius, Justus:Ad Clusii nomen lusus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ad_Clusii_nomen_lusus(last revision: 02.01.2023).","Possibly, this epigram could be found in Lipsius' correspondence with Clusius first.",IT,Yes,IT,

His first triad of epigrams was published in 1606 and immediately saw a second and third edition, establishing him as ""the English Martial"" and ""Martial Resurrected"". In 1607, a single book of epigrams followed, and two more triads of epigrams came out in 1612. In 1620, the first complete edition of Owen's epigrammatical work appeared in Leipzig. Owen's epigrams enjoyed immense success: they went through many editions and numerous translations, includingJohn Owen's Latine EpigramsandTeutschredender Owenus(cf.Jansen 2009, 275–6).In the first triad of epigrams, the reader encounters a quip on the idea of a moving earth, placed quite prominently as the fourteenth poem of the first book in the collection. The epigram of one elegiac couplet is addressed toWilliam Gilbert, who had argued for a rotating earth inDe magnete. Gilbert had explained that people do not perceive the rotation of the earth because they move along with it like a boat moving along with the water: Owen's ironical epigram turns this argument on its head by presenting the idea of a moving earth as a naive conclusion drawn from a boat trip:Stare negas terram: nobis miracula narras.Haec cum scribebas, in rate forsan eras.""You deny that the earth stands still – you tell us wonderous things. When you wrote this, you were perhaps in a boat.""While originally addressed to Gilbert, the poem was readily adapted to discussions about Copernicus and heliocentrism and entered several works devoted to this debate. For example, we can find the epigram supporting the geocentric argument inManipulus quaestionum philosophicarum(Salzburg 1687). On the other hand, it also appears at the close ofCopernicanische Vertheidigung(Prague 1765), where it is put into the mouth of a follower of Tycho. However, in a nice twist, it is answered by a second epigram voiced by a Copernican. The beginning of the poem mimicks Owen's epigram, but it then goes on to assert a moving earth:Terram stare putas? Oculos te fallere credas:quod tellus currat, mens animusque probat.""You believe that the earth stands still? You should believe that your eyes are deceiving you: the mind proves that the earth is moving.""",Martyn 1976–1978;Durand 2016(editions)Jansen 2009,"Owen, John‎(← links)An terra moveatur‎(← links)","Owen, John:Ad Gilbertum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ad_Gilbertum(last revision: 22.02.2022).","First edition in sharefolder.The epigram was also copied into a Copernicus copy held in Turin (cf.Gingerich 2002, 132–3).

The first of these eight poems is a short elegy of nine distichs by a certain Petrus Costus, whose identity with the jurist and author of an emblem book Pierre Coustau must remain a matter of speculation.The gist of the poem is simple: Rondelet has fetched all water animals out of the sea and brought them to land. The elegy presents this assertion in a symmetrical form centered on the fifth couplet, which reads:Scilicet haec una[readsumma?]est laudum, vir summe, tuarum,ut, quod erat pelagi, feceris esse soli.""For this is the sum(?) of the praise due to you: You have given to the land what used to belong to the sea.""This central couplet is preceded and followed by four distichs. The initial ones state that all sea monsters and fish have left the water. The last four detail this statement by enumerating a number of rivers and seas from which the water animals have come.While the overall structure thus appears neat and convincing, many details are disconcerting and hard to understand, also apart from the textual problem in v. 9. In v. 3, the sea monsters are said to leave the seaoffensos… tuis, victor Neptune, quadrigis: Why do they take offense at Neptun's chariot? Why is the Sea-God called a ""vanquisher"" in this context? In v. 7, fish use the same porticoes (porticibus) as men: which porticoes? That the same riverbed (alveus, v. 8) should countain all sea and land, is a strange thought as well. In vv. 13 and 15, the British are ""swift"" (celeres), the Arabs ""doubting"" (dubius), epiteths whose point remains obscure. As to the causes of these shortcomings, one is reduced to guesswork.

It comes as a surprise to find among them this short, but fervent hymn toGiordano Bruno.The epigram comprises eight elegiac couplets and symmetrically falls in two parts of four couplets each. In the first part, Bruno is extolled as a universal genius and an object of admiration for the whole world. The second part applies the ineffability topos – the notion that it is impossible to do justice to someone's or something's greatness in words – to the philosopher. Even for early modern standards, the praise heaped on Bruno is extraordinary: To Bruno alone, God and Nature have given everything they use to divide among other people (vv. 1–4). Bruno is a sublime miracle of the sky (augustum caeli monstrum), admirable to everyone (v. 5). Nature is baffled at him, because she realizes that she has created something greater than herself (v. 6). Even Apollo, the god of poetry, could not equal Bruno's greatness in words, let alone the Muses who have no right to utter even a single word about him (vv. 11–12). All of this is presented in a forceful language marked by anaphoras, polyptota, paradoxes, hyperbolas and rhetorical questions. That Bruno is constantly addressed directly (one counts no less than seven forms oftu), adds to the atmosphere of immediacy and strong emotion that pervades the poem.The text's origin and reception are fraught with questions. Whether it was prompted by personal acquaintance with Bruno or by perusal of his writings (for example by his natural philosophical poems such asDe monadeandDe immenso) is unclear. In the second epistle (p. 10) ofa posthumous edition of Acidalius' letters(Hanau 1606), Acidalius mentions Bruno, marvels at his audacity in returning to Italy (in the early 1590s) and reminds his addressee that the latter has met him in Wittenberg. It remains unclear, however, if Acidalius himself has become personally acquainted with the Italian thinker as well. As Bruno was equally loathed by all major confessions, it seems surprising that the epigram was not excised from the present edition and that it was even reprinted in the first volume of theDelitiae poetarum Germanorum(Frankfurt 1612). Perhaps, it was simply overlooked among the considerable mass of Acidalius' other poems.","Kühlmann 1979, 152–53","Acidalius, Valens‎(← links)","Acidalius, Valens:Ad Iordanum Brunum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ad_Iordanum_Brunum(last revision: 12.10.2021).","Kühlmann must have overlooked the poem in the Poematum Jani Lernutii, Jani Gulielmi, Valentis Acidalii nova editio (see 153n81).In the second letter (p. 10) ofValentis Acicalii epistolarum centuria(Hanau: Wechel, 1606), Acidalius speaks of Bruno. He marvels at Bruno's audacity in returning to Italy and says his addressee has known him in Wittenberg, but it remains unclear if Acidalius has known him there as well.","MK, IT",Yes,MK,

As indicated on the title page of the edition, both the poem's author and its dedicatee contributed something to the monumental work: the former as compiler and translator of some additional material at the end, the latter as translator of the life of Avicenna from the Arabic.The poem comprises 36 lines and is written in a comparatively rare metre primarily known from Horace'sEpodes, in which a iambic trimeter is followed by a iambic dimeter. Its content may be summarized as follows: Avicenna's teaching reflects the medical wisdom of Hippocrates and Galen; he relates to them as the moon does to the sun. Whoever criticizes Avicenna, implicitly finds fault with his Greek masters as well and wants to undo medicine at large (vv. 1–18). Paulinus often has heard Massa saying so. Avicenna's ignorant critics should therefore stop at once, otherwise they will fall victim to their own malevolence and be completely forgotten, while Avicenna will continue to serve as a guiding light to all physicians (vv. 19–36). The poem thus falls into two halves of 18 lines each, a quotation (or paraphrase) of Massa's favourable opinion on Avicenna and Paulinus' approving comments on it. This combination of an undisclosed quotation, which can be recognized as such only afterwards, and an authorial comment presumably is inspired by Horace's second epode. There, however, the statements quoted are sarcastically debunked as mere hypocrisy at the end. In the present case, by contrast, both voices are in perfect harmony. The aggressive criticism associated with the epodic form is directed against Avicenna's detractors instead.This interesting form reflects the text's peculiar content. While paratextual poems usually heap praise on the author of the respective book, Avicenna, who has been under attack from islamophobic humanists since many decades at the end of the 16th century, is mainly shielded against such criticism here. To this end, he is associated as closely as possible with the Greek classics from whom his opponents want to separate him – even at the cost of subordinating Avicenna to Hippocrates and Galen and putting him in their service. However, this stance is not maintained consistently. In fact, Avicenna's position changes for the better over the course of the poem. While he is only a moon in the medical sky at the beginning, at the end, he has become a sun in his own right:…Arabsque doctus invidum dentem supralocatus ardebit magisEt nube sol velut exiens splendentiordux praeferet medicis facem.""… and the learned Arab will rise above the teeth of envy, burn brighter, like a the sun emerging behind a cloud, and carry ahead the torch for doctors as their leader.""","Siraisi 1987, 143","Paulinus, Fabius‎(← links)","Paulinus, Fabius:Ad Laurentium Massam pro Avicenna ode, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ad_Laurentium_Massam_pro_Avicenna_ode(last revision: 25.01.2022).","On the title page of the edition, the many accretions have made the printer forget to mention theCanonitself!

This motif is present in the preface to the reader, but it is also the thread which connects four of the five paratext poems that accompany the book (the third praises Napier in rather general terms as theBuchananof mathematics). Three of these poems draw on the pointed contrast between the brevity of the book (parvus liber/liber minimus/parva tabella) and the magnitude of achievement or usefulness it contains.With twelve verses, the first poem by Patrick Sands, titledAd lectorem trigonometriae studiosum(To the Reader who is Studious in Trigonometry) is also the longest one. Like the other four, it is composed in elegiac couplets. In the first half of the poem, the poet advises the readers who want to do trigonometric measurements to use the logarithms of Napier:macte animo, insta operi, LOGARITHMIS utere, quos hic / rara Caledonii dat Baro gemma soli(""Cheer up, pursue your work, use the LOGARITHMS, which the lord, the rare gem of Scottish soil, provides here"", l. 5–6). Printed in capital letters, the neologismlogarithmusis embedded into the hexameter in a central position. In addition, it is rhetorically highlighted by the chiasm formed betweeninsta operiandlogarithmis utere. In the second half of the poem, the labour-saving nature of the new method of calculation is emphasised. In the next four lines, alliterations, anaphora and antithesis heighten the rhetorical impact of the advantages of logarithms (l. 7–10):Frustra erithinc multis tabulas extendere chartis,frustra eritetcalamocrebra litura tuo:quae nisimultiplicinumquampotuerepriores,actuunohicfacilitu numerare queas.""From now on, it will be useless to strech out tables on many sheets of paper, it will be useless to make corrections with your pen all the time: what those before only could measure in many steps, you can measure in one single, easy step.""The poem closes with a maxim in the last couplet (l. 11–12): whoever wants to be called ingenious will have to contribute something new to knowledge which surpasses the old (Ad SOPHIAM quid ferto novi, quod pristina vincat, / quisquis ab ingenio nomen habere cupis). This can be read both as a veiled praise of Napier, who had done exactly that in his book, and as an invitation to the reader to emulate Napier and advance knowledge even further.For the most part, however, Sands' poem is focussed on advertising the book to the reader or potential buyer: first, it defines the target readership (both in the title and the poem), secondly, it names (but not explains) the invention communicated in the book, and thirdly, it accentuates its practical advantages.

This work contains descriptions of plants growing in Denmark and focusses on their medical properties. It was meant to serve common people, who could not afford expensive drugs. Lauremberg’s poem starts with an accusation of the goddess Fama (“rumour”) for telling lies about the countries of the North in antiquity by claiming that they are inhospital and do neither possess rich deposits of metals nor herbs. Now that she has seen these countries and Denmark in particular, Fama is ashamed and corrects her wrong claims. In a direct speech (vv. 14–26), she describes Denmark as richer and more cultivated than other regions that have usually been described in this way in ancient texts. Fama highlights especially the “Balthica Flora”, that is mentioned at the end of vers 20, right in the middle of the poem with 19 verses preceding and 19 following it. “Flora” is here used – as one of the first instances – in the sense of the natural vegetation of a geographical area. The “Balthica Flora” is thus clearly distinguished from other such regions like Thessaly and Cyprus. Moreover, “Flora” is linked with Zephyr, several groups of nymphs, and, most importantly, Apollo who is presented as the god of medicine in this poem, and instils healing powers in the plants; a fitting “entourage” for the scope of the work, in which the poem is included. In the second part of the poem, Simon Paulli is praised and described as aopifer(v. 36) who brings the helpful herbal remedies to common people.","Berrens 2019, 240–41","Lauremberg, Johann‎(← links)","Lauremberg, Johann:Ad Simonem Paulli, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ad_Simonem_Paulli(last revision: 28.02.2022).",,DB,Yes,DB,

Like the larger work and theChronologia, it is dedicated to the margrave Pietro Francesco Malaspina degli Edifizi, whose mathematical interests and expertise are praised in an introductory letter (pp. 3–4). The text falls into five chapters: 1. The subject matter of the mathematical disciplines. 2. The nature of the geometrical / mathematical proof. 3. The excellence of mathematical knowledge. 4. Against some slanders of mathematics. 5. Applied mathematics. An appendix (pp. 32–35) illustrates some of Biancani's assertions by way of an analysis of all proofs used in the first book of Euclid'sElements.Despite the work's shortness, its argument is complex and multi-layered, and its understanding presupposes some knowledge of the so-calledQuaestio de certitudine mathematicarumraised byAlessandro Piccolominiin hisCommentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum, since it is in large part directed against less positive views of mathematics expressed in the course of this debate. Biancani's central point, which is developed in chs. 1 and 2, may be summarised as follows: Mathematical proofs aredemonstrationes potissimae(""the most powerful proofs""), that is, proofs demonstrating not only that, but also why a certain fact is true. This applies to pure and applied mathematics alike. In order to demonstrate this assertion, Biancani starts from a clarification of the nature and existence of mathematical objects .

These exist as intelligible matter in the divine and the human mind. The second and longest chapter on themedium(the middle term) of geometrical and arithmetical proofs and whether they constitutedemonstrationes potissimaeis directly opposed to Piccolomini's ideas.In order to convince his readers of his point of view, the author intermingles arguments from authority (esp. Aristotle) and from proper reasoning and makes use of a loosely scholastic style of exposition (rigorous structuring of the argument, numbering of single points, enumeration of objections countered byrespondeo, ""I answer"" etc.).

Ode,"Illustrissimi et reverendissimi Maffaei sanctae Romanae ecclesiae cardinalis Barberini, sanctissimi domini nostri signaturae iustitiae praefecti etc. poemata, p. 46–9",1620,Paris,"Estienne, Antoine",17th century,"Panegyric poem, Other (see description)",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Adulatio perniciosa(Google Books),775165,"In 1620, the first edition of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini’s collection of poetry was printed in Paris. Among its 31 poems is a Latin ode in 19 Alcaic stanzas titledAdulatio perniciosa(Pernicious Adulation). The title refers to the perils of a king’s life: His life might look like the most splendid life from the outside, but a king’s joys are tainted by worries like Prometheus is wounded by the eagle. These worries are caused by the adulation of his surroundings, which drives truth away from the king’s door and makes it impossible to know whom to trust. A dire example for the dangers of adulation is the giant Argus, who, even though he has one hundred eyes, is lulled to sleep by Mercury’s beautiful song and killed.The poem is introduced by a lengthy simile from astronomy: On a clear night sky, various wondrous stars and planets can be observed – one is drawn to look at the Evening Star, Mars and the Milky Way, another at the Polar Star, Antares, and Sirius, a third may marvel the companions of Jupiter or Saturn, which were discovered with the telescope –, but the sun outshines everything. In the same way, everyone is attracted to different life styles, but still, the life of a king seems to be the happiest to all. As has become evident, a panegyrical reference of Galileo’s recent telescopic discoveries is worked into this simile:Miratur alter vel Iovis asseclas / patrisve Saturni repertos, / docte, tuo, Galilaee, vitro(“Another one wonders at the companions of Jupiter, or of his father Saturn, which were discovered by your glass, learned Galileo.”). While the telescopic discoveries here are presented as just another way to observe the skies in addition to the naked eye, they assume a pointed meaning in relation to the topic of the poem in the second instance they are referenced in the poem: Not everything that is splendid from the outside is splendid on the inside, too: just as the sun has been revealed to have spots by Galileo’s art, a king’s outward joys are disturbed by worries:respicimus nigras / in sole – quis credat? – retectas / arte tua, Galilaee, labes(“I think about the black spots on the sun – who would believe it? –, which were discovered by your art, Galileo”).Barberini thus works the praise of Galileo’s incredible and marvelous discoveries – the moons of Jupiter, the three bodies of Saturn, and the solar spots – as similes into a poem on another subject. Galileo is addressed twice in the poem in anapostrophe, making him the dedicatee of the poem. This is confirmed in aletterwhich Barberini sent, together with a copy of the poem, to Galileo on August 28th, 1620. In the letter, he explains that the poem arose from his respect for the scientist (he even signs ascome fratello, cf.Opere, vol. XIII, no. 1479, p. 48–9). Barberini, who became pope Urban VIII in 1623, was a patron of Galileo until 1633, when after the publication of hisDialogo, Galileo was tried by the Inquisition. However, in the great number of subsequent editions and reprints of Barberini’spoemata, theAdulatio perniciosawas always kept as part of the collection.",,"Barberini, Maffeo (Urban VIII)‎(← links)","Barberini, Maffeo (Urban VIII):Adulatio perniciosa, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Adulatio_perniciosa(last revision: 08.09.2021).",,IT,Yes,IT,

In the sixteenth century, the Sicilian jurist and historian Antonio Filoteo degli Omodei was well aware that there was already a rich literature on the Sicilian volcano when he wrote hisTopography of Etna(cf. e.g. the entry on Pietro Bembo'sDe Aetnain this database). He positioned his text – an excerpt from his description of Sicily – within the existing literature as a place where curious readers could ""skip the great number of [other] books [on the topic] and admire Etna in a short read, in a way, and examine it more comfortably"" (ut tot praetermissis voluminibus Aetnam brevissima profecto lectione mirari quodammodo, et perscrutari commodius valeant, p. 2).Indeed, theTopography of Etnais a treatise of little more than 50 pages, combining humanist learning with the author's own observations of the mountain. In the course of the text, Omodei relates his ascents of Etna in 1533, 1540 and 1545 and presents a graphic eyewitness account of the eruption in 1536. At numerous points, the text is adorned with Latin and Italian verses, viewing the mountain through the prism of (classical) literature. In addition, a vivid picture of Etna is painted by richness in detail, contrasts and other literary strategies. For example, in the opening sentences, the reader is drawn in by a description of a snow-covered Etna spewing fire, causing the earth to shake and rumble, a description that appeals to several senses at once. In the introduction, the author seems to reflect on the conversion of experience into literature when he states that in his opinion, it is more enjoyable to learn about Etna by reading than to witness its eruptions first-hand (p. 2).While the treatise was written around 1560, it was printed only after Omodei's death and appeared in Venice in 1591. The editor Niccolò degli Oddi corrected scribal mistakes in the manuscript and furnished the text with marginal notes and an index. Moreover, he added three poems in praise of the book, an Italian sonnet, a Latin and a Greek epigram, at least the first of which was composed by Oddi himself. It seems likely that Oddi picked the treatise on Etna for publication because its topic made it a fitting gift for his Sicilian patron Giovanni III Ventimiglia, the dedicatee of the print.TheTopography of Etnawas printed again in Frankfurt in 1600 as part of the collectionItalia illustrata, which saw a second edition in 1605. A few years later, it was translated into Italian and published asLa descrittione latina del sito di Mongibelloin Palermo in 1611. In the seventeenth century, it became a source for new works on Etna. It is cited at length, for example, in Giovanni Alfonso Borelli'sHistoria et meteorologia incendii Aetnaeiof 1670 (pp. 12-13).

In this approach, then, Pascasius differentiates himself dramatically from more widespread contemporary ideas that a compulsion for gambling was due to a person’s poor moral standards, for example, or stemmed generally from mankind’s innate weakness and tendency to corruption after his Fall from grace. In the first of theAlea’s two books, Pascasius describes problem gambling alongside related compulsive behaviours. He concentrates here on what he sees as the underlying causes of the problem, its results, the ‘character’ of affected people, and how their disorder can be identified. The second book is dedicated to the treatment of the identified problem. Pascasius’ ‘cure’ reads (to the modern ear) as a kind of therapy based on understanding the disease, its causes and effect, properly accepting these facts and correcting one’s internal attitude towards them.TheAlea’s Latin text often extends into long periods, which, combined with his habitual piling up of examples and re-expressions of the an idea in new terms, can occasionally create a stilted effect for the reader. In matters of medical concepts and terminology, Pascasius relies on a typical contemporary Aristotelean/ Galenic grounding. In searching for authoritative ancient expressions of his ideas about gambling more specifically, or when in need of a pithy summary for his argument, he turns frequently to citations from classical literature (predominantly in Latin, but often also in Greek with translations). The 1561 edition of the text is accompanied by headings and descriptions of key arguments in the margins.

As one of them bears the printer mark of Martin Landsberg, they presumably all came from his presses, and since they strongly overlap with manuscript material by Johannes Widmann, they are commonly attributed to this mathematician andRechenmeister. At the time, Widmann gave lectures on mathematics at the Arts Faculty of the University of Leipzig, and it seems probable a priori that the six treatises correspond to as many parts of one or several of his courses. A look at theAlgorithmus minutiarum vulgarium(""Method of Calculating with Common Fractions"") corroborates this assumption.After the sober title page which only features the three words of the title, the treatise comprises a bare eight quarto pages. After an introduction of two pages, eight chapters give rules for as many mathematical operations: 1.De reductione(finding a common denominator for different fractions, which is rightly said to be fundamental for everything that follows); 2.De additione(adding fractions to each other); 3.De subtractione(subtraction of one fraction from another); 4.De duplatione(duplicating fractions); 5.De mediatione(halving them); 6.De multiplicatione(multiplying them with each other); 7.De divisione(dividing fractions by fractions); 8.De radicum extractione(extracting square and cubic roots of fractions).The chapterDe reductionecontains not only the usual method of finding a common denominator (simply by multiplying the denominators of the corresponding fractions) but also a method calledinfilcareorinsitioin other sources. It allows to reduce a scheme representing a finite continued fraction to a simple fraction (Vogel 1982, 14–18). This seemed to be a rather common question among medieval arabic and later mostly Italian mathematicians (starting with Fibonacci'sLiber abaci) but almost unknown in Europe outside Italy (Vogelclaims it to be completely unknown). Widmann'sAlgorithmusseems to be an exception.The text is set in blackletter, the layout is unadorned but neat. The very generous margins were presumably meant to take the student's notes during the lectures, even if there are none in the present digital copy. The texts begins with the wordsQuoniam autem …(""But because …""), which shows the lecturer changing over from a previous topic to the present one. Within the treatment, there is a number of back references to a previous discussion of integers. The description of the different operations is completely abstract; examples were probably given during the lecture itself. The language is technical and standardised; the same terms (e.g.,ducere in, i.e. ""multiply"",numerator,denominator) recur over and over again. Mathematical notation is completely absent. Every chapter is introduced by a definition of the respective operation, after which the single steps are described mostly in the passive subjunctive (subtrahatur,dupleturand the like). Different cases are distinguished by conditional clauses (Si …, si vero …). The only authorities cited areEuclidand his 13th century translator and commentatorCampanus of Novara.In contrast to theEnchiridion novus algorismiand theArithmeticae practicae methodus facilis, which are situtated somewhere between the academic world and the world of merchants, the present text can be assigned firmly to the academic sphere. This is an early modern university textbook of elementary mathematicspar excellence.","Gärtner 2000, 37–45, esp. 42–43","Widmann, Johannes‎(← links)Arithmetices erotemata puerilia‎(← links)Liber abaci‎(← links)","Widmann, Johannes:Algorithmus minutiarum vulgarium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Algorithmus_minutiarum_vulgarium(last revision: 26.02.2023).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

Among several other works (Knobloch 1983, 134–144), he authored two one-year-almanacs for the years 1510 and 1512. The first of these is the presentNew and Corrected Almanac for the Year of the Lord 1510. The booklet, which comprises 27 pages, displays a simple structure. After the title page, a preface and some key data for 1510, there follow the tables themselves. The organization of the key data and the tables is taken over without any changes from Regiomontanus' work (see there for a brief description).The most important trait of theNew and Corrected Almanacis alluded to in the full title, where the work is calledex propriis tabulis calculatum, and spelled out in the one and a half pages of thepraefatio, which starts from the blunt statement:Motus planetarum in tabulis Alfonsi et Blanchini sunt falsi.(""The movements of the planets given in the Alfonsine tables and those of [Giovanni] Bianchini [mid-15th century, adapted from the former, much used in the 15th and 16th centuries] are false."") Engel claims to have found out, together with his teacher Andreas Stiborius and other Viennese astronomers, that the values of these works are wrong by two or three degrees. He therefore composed his own, corrected tables (which unfortunately are lost today) ""to restaure the most noble science and to the benefit of those who cast horoscopes"" (ob nobilissimae scientiae restaurationem atque prognosticantium utilitatem). The present almanac is based  on Engel's own figures and therefore superior to earlier works of the same kind. (In fact, as argued byDobrzycki; Kremer 1996, both of Engel's almanacs may belong to a chain of transmission by which superior data from Persian and Syrian sources found their way to Copernicus, ultimately influencing the gestation ofDe revolutionibus orbium coelestium.) The rest of the preface substantiates this claim with the help of a series of examples, which contrast planetary positions calculated on the basis of the Alfonsine/Bianchini tables with those found by Engel. The following passage provides an impression of this procedure:Saturnus enim iuxta antiquum almanach 14. die Aprilis reperitur in 2. gradu, minuto 57. Librae latitudinem habens septentrionalem duorum graduum 48 minutorum, ubi fere ponitur stella fixa de tertia magnitudine in ala sinistra Virginis. Huic itaque stellae Saturnus in praememorata die secundum antiquum almanach coniunctus, secundum meas tabulas et secundum istud novum almanach, secundum denique ipsam veritatem, quae intuentibus patebit, die 29. Martii in eadem fere latitutine se coniunget[misprinted as-ebat] .""According to the old almanac [presumably Johannes Stöffler's and Jakob Pflaum'sAlmanach nova(1499)], Saturnus is found on the 14 April at 2°57' of Libra at a northern latitude of 2°48', more or less at the place of the fixed star of third magnitude in the armpit of Virgo. So on the aforementioned day, Saturnus is close to this star according to the old almanach, but according to my tables, this new almanach and finally truth itself, which will become obvious to all observers, it will be close to it on 29 March at about the same latitude.""Engel's method of promoting his work is rhetorically efficient, as his detailed descriptions of planetary positions with their precise figures create an air of accuracy and thoroughness. The preface concludes with some remarks about the grave mistakes bound to occur in horoscopes based on the ""old almanac"", which of course once more highlights how indispensable Engel's own almanac is.",Dobrzycki; Kremer 1996,"Engel, Johann‎(← links)","Engel, Johann:Almanach novum atque correctum super anno Domini 1510, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Almanach_novum_atque_correctum_super_anno_Domini_1510(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,MK,,MK,

In 1671–76, the French Académie des Sciences fuelled interest in it by issuing the lavishly producedMémoires pour servir à l'histoire des animaux, which was translated into English asMemoirs for a Natural History of Animals(1688). However, both works were difficult to obtain, and few continental readers were able to deal with the English version. This prompted Michael Bernhard Valentini, professor of medicine in Giessen, to compile the presentAmphitheatre– a common title for works of encyclopaedic aspirations –of Animal Anatomy. He translated the work of the Académie des Sciences and added sections from Severino, theZootomiaandAnatome animalium(1676, 1681) by the Dutch anatomist Gerard Blasius, and various scientific journals.The result is an account of animal anatomy structured in 142 sections, each of which is devoted to one specific creature. The sections are ordered roughly according to axiological criteria, beginning with the elephant and descending towards the invertebrates at the end. (This is probably what Valentini means when he speaks of his wish to createunum aliquod systemain theIntroductio). Each section is assigned to its author or at least the original place of publication is given. Divided among two separately paginated parts, the entire account comprises over 460 folio pages printed in two columns and small font. The text is supplemented by over one hundred plates with anatomical illustrations at the end of the volume. (They are introduced by an index telling the bookbinder which plate he should glue to which textpage, but at least in the present copy, this prescription was not heeded.)TheAmphitheatre of Animal Anatomyis embedded in numerous paratexts and rounded off by a couple of smaller works. Two title pages frame a frontispiece full of birds and skeletons. A motto from Ps 148 speaking of the many animals created by God is followed by a dedication to Valentini's territorial lord Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. Next come, for unclear reasons, a letter from the Prussian Academy of Sciences asking Valentini for scientific contributions and an overview of the anatomical demonstrations given at Berlin in the course of a year. Finally, there is the abovementionedIntroductio. TheAmphitheatreproper is followed by an appendix comprising three more texts: an anonymous work on how a dissection should be conducted, a treatise by Simon Paulli the Younger (1603–80) on how to bleach the bones when preparing a skeleton, and an overview, partly in the form of tables, of human anatomy by Johannes Jacobus Rau (1668–1719). At the very end, there is an index of the animals discussed and the instruction for the binder.The work demonstrates how marginal originality and even authorship in the modern sense of the word could be in early modern science in comparison to compilation and disclosure of information. Strictly speaking, Valentini is the author of nothing he presents in this massive volume. His achievement rather consists in collecting, translating and organizing his material and in overseeing the production of the illustrations. Nonetheless, the endeavour cost him much time and labour, as he mentions on the last page of theIntroductio, and reputable publishers were willing to invest a considerable sum in it. As the work saw a second edition in 1742, the investment seems to have payed off.","Klein 1999, 1921","Valentini, Michael Bernhard‎(← links)","Valentini, Michael Bernhard:Amphitheatrum zootomicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Amphitheatrum_zootomicum(last revision: 15.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

As the title makes clear, the author (and the student taking part in the disputation which followed the reading of this poem — more on this below) supported the idea that sound travelled using air as a medium. In both Oxford and Cambridge, questions over the propagation of sound appear with increasing frequency among the titles of disputations and the poems which accompanied these events by tradition at the end of the seventeenth and the early eighteenth centuries.Bachelor students in early modern Oxford took part in disputations, in this period exclusively in Latin, throughout their university careers both as part of their learning process, and as part of their graduation. These disputationes pro gradu were not frequently published as dissertationes (as in other parts of Europe), but textual evidence of the events does survive in the form of the poems read out before a disputatio began. A number of these Latin ‘Act’ verses, as modern scholarship calls them, on natural philosophical topics were collected for publication first by Charles Este and in a second volume by Anthony Parsons in 1723 and 1748 respectively. A similar form of verse composition occurred in Cambridge, where the slightly longer poems (‘Tripos’ verses), occasionally composed in Greek as well as in Latin, were not read out aloud, but rather circulated among the audience on printed broadsheets during the event.The poems are usually anonymous. While some were probably composed by the student taking part in the disputatio, this was by no means always the case. Those less talented in Latin verse composition might ask or pay a colleague to write one on their behalf. In Oxford all the poems composed in elegiac couplets. As is the case in this particular poem, the Act verses can often be characterised as witty pieces packing a blend of concepts from natural philosophy with contemporary issues and classical literary ideas into short (e.g. 6–14 lines) and humourous verses.In our example (p. 69), the poet addresses a curious episode invented and published in the Tatler 23rd Nov. 1710 (254) where sailors stuck in the icy seas around Nova Zembla begin to have trouble hearing each other as the temperatures drop, only to hear their words ‘unfrozen’ later on as the temperatures rise again. The question over the effect of the air’s temperature (and pressure) on the propagation of sound formed an important part of the early modern study of sound. Bacon had raised the question in hisSylva Sylvarumand it remained a vivid part of discussion for natural philosophers until Laplace’s explanation in 1823.",Gadd 2013;Hall 2009;Tyacke 1997,Anonymus 3‎(← links),"Anonymus 3:An aer sit soni vehiculum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/An_aer_sit_soni_vehiculum(last revision: 01.08.2021).",,WB,Yes,WB,

Perhaps the most famous example isJohn Owen'sEpigram to William Gilbert(first published in 1606), in which the popular epigrammatist made fun of Gilbert's belief in a moving earth. Other epigrammatists, however, rushed to the side of those who believed that the earth was moving and the fixed stars were standing still. In the third book of Erasmus Rothmaler'sDeliciae poeticae(Poetic Delights), we find such an epigram. The titleAn terra moveatur(Whether the earth is moving) takes the form of an indirect question and thus mimicks the the headings of dissertations and other scientific writings. Like Owen's epigram, which Rothmaler might have known, the epigram is condensed to the shortest possible form in elegiac poetry and consists of only one distich. In these two lines, the poet's persona talks to an unknown addressee (perhaps the reader), asking him why he doubts that the heavens stand still and the earth is moving, if the earthly things perish and the heavenly realms remain:Stare quid addubitas coelum terramque moveri,si terrena ruunt, coelica regna manent?The epigram thus connects the scientific question of whether the earth moves or not with a trope of evanescence: things on earth change and decay, but heaven is eternal. Tension is built in the hexameter, which poses the question, and released in the pentameter, which delivers the (surprising) answer. The antitheses between heaven and earth as well as between movement and stasis, or transience and eternity, are highlighted by a chiasm in the hexameter(stare coelum-terramque moveri), but by a parallelism in the pentameter (terrena ruunt - coelica regna manent). In addition,stareandmoveriare positioned at the ends of the hexameters and thus given special emphasis. Between hexameter and pentameter, there is another chiasm: the heavens come first the hexameter, but second in the pentameter, while for the earth, it is the other way around.Rothmaler's epigram seems to have never been printed again, but it illustrates how the geocentric-heliocentric debate could be harvested as a promising subject for Neo-Latin poetry, as it lend itself to the pointed contrasts and antitheses that are typical of the epigram.",,"Rothmaler, Erasmus‎(← links)","Rothmaler, Erasmus:An terra moveatur, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/An_terra_moveatur(last revision: 11.10.2021).","Maybe the first word ""stare"" is intended to echo Owen's epigram.",IT,Yes,IT,

In the first letter (Anatomes plantarum idea; p. 1–15), Malpighi not only explains why he chose to write about plant anatomy (in contrast to anatomy of animals there was hardly any knowledge on the structure and development of plants) but also explains the division of his book and gives a short introduction.

The disposition of the questions is comparable to other disputations on the same subject, as are the frequent references to Aristotle and also Renaissance commentaries; the dissertation's language and style are comparatively elaborate and point at how printed dissertations became longer and gained importance also as written products.Q 1: Theoretical definition and etymology:Quomodo nix sit definienda?(2,5 p.)Q 2: A material definition of snow, following Aristotelian lines of thought:Quaenam sit nivis materia ex qua?(4,5 p.)Q 3: On the elevation of clouds:Quomodo materia nubis, e qua nix oritur, elevetur ad secundam aeris regionem?(2 p.)Q 4: On the causes for the formation of clouds and snow:Quaenam sit causa efficiens et nubis et nivis?(1 p.)Q 5: About thealbedoof snow:Unde sit nivis albedo?(2 p.)Q 6: About thefiguraof snow:Unde sit figura nivis?(2 p.)Q 7: About thefertilitas:Quomodo nix terram foecundet?(2 p.)Q 8 (in print: 6): About medical side effects:Quomodo nix membra frigore laesa restituat?(1,5 p.)A certain stilistical aspiration can be noted in the various appraisals in the paratext:Scazontesby Paul Sperling; a single elegiac couplet by the praeses (whoapplaudit); a short German poem by Jacob Dornkrell ab Eberhertz ; a single elegiac couplet, followed by a few lines, by Abraham Müller; four elegiac couplets, followed by a few lines in prose, by a certain Cosmas Elrod.",,"Brücken, Christoph Heinrich‎(← links)Gramm, Caeso‎(← links)Anatomia Nivis(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Gramm, Caeso; Brücken, Christoph Heinrich:Anatomia nivis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Anatomia_nivis(last revision: 19.11.2021).",,UK,Yes,UK,

In addition, there are a handful of simple sentences on the number of bones, on very small bones and on the number and names of the teeth in the upper left-hand corner (presumably because there was not enough space to depict the small bones or to label the teeth of the skeleton in the printed image). A Latin text in the upper right-hand corner indicates that the woodcut was made by Richard Helain (Ricardus Hela), a doctor of medicine in Paris, and printed (""multiplied"") in Nuremberg in 1493. The style of the image, the gothic script and the lexical choices (e.g.totalis numerusfor ""total number"") link this early print to the medieval tradition. According toSudhoff 1908, 44–49, Helain had probably taken the image from an illuminated medical manuscript which had been compiled for a French barber in the mid-fifteenth century.The text is scarce in this anatomical sheet. Limited to labels and short sentences without any literary ornament, its only function is to inform the reader about the nomenclature of bones. In this sense, this print is located at the fringes of literature. On the other hand, it is important to note that this function is assigned to Latin, the principle language of learned discourse. Thus the sheet addresses a Latinate audience, within, but perhaps also beyond, the medical community.

It was printed in Wittenberg, where Bartholin stayed for a time and issued the same year that he was appointed as professor of eloquence to the university of Copenhagen. Two years later, he would be chosen as professor of medicine at the same university.The book is dedicated to the Danish nobleman Oliger Rosenkrantz. A lengthy preface to the reader explains the author's initial reluctance to publish what he had himself drawn together with great pains and his colleague's frequent encouragements to gift his knowledge to the public. It then addresses several famous European anatomists, which influenced Bartholin and his work, i.a. his teacher in Basel,Caspar Bauhain, orFabricius ab Aquapendente. 
What follows is a comprehensive instruction in contemporary anatomical knowledge of the body, beginning with a generalprooemiumon the subject of anatomy and the different parts of the human body. Those are then described in detail in eight books, grouped in fourlibriand fourlibelli, based on the threeventresor cavities of the body (abdomen, thorax, cranium) and the extremities. Those are detailed in the four books, while thelibellitreat the veins, stemming from the abdomen; the arteries, coming from the heart; the nerves, originating in the brain; and the bones, most of which are found in the limbs. 
Bartholin goes to great lengths to make the content of his work easily accessible to his readers: The books and booklets describing the different parts of the human body are divided into numerous chapters and sub-chapters. Additionally, marginal notes summarize the content.Termini techniciare in many cases printed in italics. Many topics are laid out in numbered lists.

The first of these works, dated 28th July 1580, were hisObservations on Ephemerides. A small monograph of little more than 20 pages, theObservationsattacked head-on one of the central problems of astronomy: establishing reliable data. Altavilla points out that all astronomical almanacs (ephemerides) derived from the Alfonsine or the Copernican tables are unreliable, a claim that he attempts to prove by juxtaposing astronomical data from different sources in two columns.In the preface to the reader, Altavilla informs the reader that the short work was written and published very quickly and shows himself confident of its impact: an intrepid dwarf, it attacks the giant cohorts of theephemeridesand triumphs over them (cum pumilio in giganteas ephemeridarum cohortes intrepidus audeat eisque prostratis victorum more ovans prosiliat). Altavilla's Latin prose argument is only 9 1/2 pages long, while the tables comparing astronomical data make up 13 pages of the monograph. In the space between the two columns, the sentenceVide diligenter, quanta sit inter se differentia(""Look carefully how much one differs from the other"", with some variants) is printed vertically, twice, on every page. Different signs indicate the size of the difference between the sets of data: an asterisk marks a difference of 1–30 days, a triangle a difference of 1–6 months, a square a difference of up to nine months and two circles a difference of a year or more. In the conclusion, Altavilla warns the readers not to rely on ancient writings without daily observations of the stars and not to prefer the opinions of authorities to the truth.The monograph is framed by two poems: a Neo-Latin poem byPandolfo Sfondratiat the beginning (Omodeo 2008) and an Italian poem byFrancesco Maria Vialardiat the end.The publication of theObservationscaused some irritation. A year later, in the same printing shop,Giovanni Battista Benedettipublished a response to Altavilla's attack inletter form. Among other points – not least Altavilla's lack of astronomical skills –, Benedetti asserts in his Italian letter that the problem was nothing new, and that new observations would bring ever more reliable astronomical tables in the future.

This particularly concerns peculiar and curious cases like the present one, which is told, not by the attending doctor, but by an anonymous patient, who is no physician himself. His narrative (pp. 143–159) is followed by anepicrisis, a commentary by the physician Matthaeus Mederer, professor of surgery in Freiburg (pp. 159–168).The patient, who seems to be well-off and well-educated, still is a young man of 28 years when consigning his medical history to paper in 1778 (why it is printed only nine years later remains unclear), but he already looks back upon a medical history originating in his earliest childhood and spanning several decades. His basic problem is a compulsion to vomit large quantities of pus daily despite his otherwise strong and healthy constitution. His report, subdivided into 40 paragraphs, takes the form of an anamnesis, followed by a description of his present state and way of life and intermixed with some etiological speculations. The last paragraph contains six questions regarding the nature and etiology of his disease as well as possible remedies. The patient shows considerable psychological strain, which apparently motivates his unusually detailed and telling report. On several occasions, he voices his distress through adjectives likemiser(""wretched"") andfoedus(""repulsive""). For the better part, however, his tone is sober and objective.The Latin of the report is unidiomatic at some points. In his first question, for instance, the patient asks if another case similar to his own is known (p. 158):Extatne tale exemplum, quod hominum aliquis morbum meo similem habuerit?. In this sentence,exemplum, quod(""example, that"") seems to be calqued on colloquial German, instead ofmeoone would expectmei, and the subjunctivehabueritis hypercorrect. In classical Latin, the sentence might read:Extatne aliud exemplum hominis morbo mei simili affecti?Nonetheless, the patient's narrative and descriptions are precise, graphic, and easy to follow. To condemn his language as ""barbarous Latinity"", as Daniel Bernoulli, the editor of theActa, does in a note at the beginning, seems oversevere.Mederer's epicrisis adds little to the patient's account. Mederer expresses his admiration of a layman's capacity to describe his symptoms so clearly and by and large agrees with his autodiagnosis (an abscess –vomicaorsaccus– in the left lung) as well as with the principles of his manner of life. Much space is used on declarations that the case is crystal clear and invectives against other doctors who invariably failed to see the obvious. Mederer's answers to the patient's questions remain meaningless – with one exception: At the very end, he proposes surgery in order to open the ulcer in the lung and to drain the pus generated there outwards.",,"Anonymus 17‎(← links)Mederer, Matthaeus‎(← links)","Anonymus 17; Mederer, Matthaeus:Anonymi auctoris descriptio affectus morbosi in semet ipso exorti, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Anonymi_auctoris_descriptio_affectus_morbosi_in_semet_ipso_exorti(last revision: 01.04.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In the preface, Froidmont informs the reader thatAnt-Aristarchuswas written in reaction toPhilips van Lansbergen's popular description of the heliocentric system, which was published inLatin translationin 1630.The title stresses the ancient origins of heliocentric ideas, most prominently of course by calling the bookAnt-Aristarchus, but also by calling the decree of 1616 a decree againstPythagorico-Copernicani. The first word of the preface is also carefully chosen to emphasise the ancient roots of the debate:Vetus in scholastico pulvere est ista rixa, utrum caelum terra stante circumeat, an caelo stante terra vertatur. (""Old is this fight in the school-dust whether the heavens moves while the earth is fixed, or the earth moves while the heavens are fixed."") Copernicus, the preface continues, merely breathed new life into the Pythagoreans who had already been crushed by the authority of many and the weight of the arguments against them.There are two conspicuous differences between Froidmont'sAnt-Aristarchusand his earlierSomnium sive peregrinatio caelestis: Firstly, while theSomniumleaves some room to interpretation concerning its attitude towards Copernican ideas, theAnt-Aristarchusargues unmistakably and systematically against Copernicanism. Secondly, in contrast to the intricate Latin of theSomnium, Froidmont uses a clear and elegant, easily readable Latin in theAnt-Aristarchus. From the perspective of literary studies, theses difference can (in part) be explained by the fact that the texts belong to different literary genres, a satirical dream narrative on the one hand and a monograph on the other.TheAnt-Aristarchusis a slender book consisting of 109 quarto pages, neatly divided into 20 numbered chapters and an epilogue. It covers a variety of scriptural and scientific arguments to prove that the earth is not moving, e.g. that if the earth moved, a cannon would go further when fired towards the west than when fired towards the east (chapter 9) or that the movement of the earth would produce a constant sound (chapter 11). Each chapter is headed by a summary of the main points of the argument. Marginal notes indicate the sources of the plethora of quotes in the main text, taken from ancient authors like Aristotle, Lucretius and Seneca, biblical texts or contemporary authors likeGalileo,GilbertandKepler. Greek sources are always cited in the original and in Latin translation. A few woodcuts accompany the text, illustrating the Copernican and the Tychonic system (Froidmont's preferred model), the phases of Venus, the movement of objects relative to the supposed movement of the earth and the vast empty space between Saturn and the sphere of the fixed stars in the Copernican system.One of the readers of Froidmont'sAnt-Aristarchuswas Galileo, who wrote in a letter that among all Copernicus' adversaries that had come to his attention, Froidmont seemed to him the most sensible and most capable (quoted aftervan Nouhuys 1998, 246).","Monchamp 1892,van Nouhuys 1998,Pantin 2001","Froidmont, Libert‎(← links)Philolaus‎(← links)","Froidmont, Libert:Ant-Aristarchus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ant-Aristarchus(last revision: 25.01.2022).","Pantin 2001: ""Dans l’Ant-Aristarchus, Froidmont, qui a été un philosophe ouvert et brillant, et qui voit devant lui une belle carrière d’exégète et de controversiste, domine entièrement son sujet sous ses différents aspects.

Triegler's adaptation is furnished with a remarkably lavish paratextual apparatus, comprising a Latin dedication to god, the crest of the dedicatee Christoph von Dorstadt, a German dedication letter, an author portrait, a German letter to the reader, and, finally, no fewer than seven panegyric poems exclusively written in Latin.With only four elegiac couplets, the epigram presented here is the shortest of the seven poems. However, it stands out among them not only because of its length, but also because it elaborates in a beautiful and pointed manner the idea that the translation made the astronomical knowledge enshrined in theSphaeraaccessible to a wider readership (although in reality, the first German translation of theSphaerawas published a century earlier). The epigram has no title, but a subscription identifies its author as Conrad Bavarus, professor of poetry at the University of Leipzig.The first half of the poem works with effective contrasts: Before, the heavens were only penetrable for the learned [i.e. for those who know Latin] – now, they shine and are open also to the unlearned (v. 1–2):Ante fuit doctis solum penetrabile caelum,indoctis illud nunc nitet atque patet.Consequently, the glory of the translator Triegler surpasses that of the first author [i.e. Sacrobosco] (v. 3–4).

A diplomat for the French king, Polignac came in contact with many philosophers and natural philosophers of the time and developed the idea to defend his own philosophical views, largely inspired by his Jesuit education and by Cartesianism, against materialistic and especially atomistic opinions. He designed an attack against Lucretius and his followers, using his very own form: the Latin didactic poem. Planned to consist of ten books all in all, the cardinal only succeeded in finishing eight full books and a fragmentary ninth book before his death in 1741. In these books, ranging from about 1000 to about 1600 hexameters each, Polignac discusses the concept of pleasure (I), followed by three physical books on the impossibility of a vacuum (II), the divisibility of atoms (III) as well as motion (IV), and three books on the biology of humans, animals and plants, about the mind (V), animals (VI), and reproduction (VII). Book eight deals with the heliocentric cosmos, while book nine introduces ""water and land"". Each book is preceded by a short summary of its content. All this philosophical and scientific content, including not only up-to-date knowledge of the time, but also quite controversial questions, is presented in a Lucretian manner, imitating his verses and means of description, but also Vergilian linesin extenso.Parts of the work were already known to a large circle of intellectuals before Polignac's death, as he had been working on the text for decades and had been circulating parts of his manuscripts or reading them at different occasions. TheAnti-Lucretiusbecame a huge success in the eighteenth century. After the first publication in Paris, it was reprinted in London in 1748, 1751 and 1768, in Paris 1749 and 1754, in Brussels 1748 and in Leipzig in the same year. It was translated into several vernaculars soon after the first edition, first in French in 1749, an edition which saw several reprints, and by another translator in 1786.

WhileNewton's most famous opponent, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published his alternativeFarbenlehrein German (1810), Celestino Cominale had brought his LatinAnti-Newtonianismusin four volumes to the printing press in Naples already in the second half of the eighteenth century. The first volume (1754) opposed Newton'soptics, the second one (1756) Newton's physics, including vacuum, inertia and gravitation. Thethirdvolume (1769), published after a gap of thirteen years, dealt with the nature, origin and measurement of forces, and thefourth(1770) criticised Newton's astronomy (the third and fourth volumes are not yet available online).Goethe knew the first and second volume of the work andreviewedthem favourably in his ownFarbenlehre, even if he was convinced that the work did not have any impact, because the Jesuits had already started teaching Newtonian physics in their schools. Indeed, the fact that theAnti-Newtonianismusis little known (there is no entry for his name in the index ofThe Reception of Isaac Newton in Europe) is probably a result of the predominance of Newtonian physics on the one hand and of the relative obscurity of the author on the other. Cominale, who was professor of philosophy and mathematics at the royal archigymnasium of Naples, shows himself acutely aware of both of these factors in the preface to the first volume, which is dedicated to Francesca Acquaviva. The preface opens with the following words:Temeritatis impudentisque audaciae res plena videri poterit, prima fronte, me ignotum infimique subselli virum [...] novam theoriam spondere et contra tot ab hinc annis receptum, tantisque fulcitum experimentis celeberrimi Newtoni de coloribus systema scribere.""It might seem very inconsiderate and shamelessly bold, at first glance, that I, a nobody of very low rank, [...] promise a new theory and write against the system of colours of the most celebrated Newton, which has been accepted for so many years and corroborated by such great experiments.""In this Newtonian age, Cominale continues, it is heresy in the eyes of almost all scientists to criticise Newton. In fact, Newton has taken Aristotle's place, in that it is only allowed to explain and illustrate his teachings, and only by a very select group of people at that. In contrast to this adulation of Newton, Cominale claims for himselflibertas philosophandi, which, as he emphasises, is necessary for scientific progress. While the Neapolitan writer polemicizes against the uncritical followers of Newton, he stresses that he does not want to take anything away from Newton's achievements.In the paratext of the second volume, which is dedicated to Niccolò Caracciolo, we can already get a sense of the negative reception of his work (for an example, see thisreviewof both volumes). The most striking example is the opening line of the preface, which is put into the mouth of Cominale's Newtonian critics and quotesHalley's poemon Newton'sPrincipia:Quid? Iterumne prodit in scenam profugus, imprudens, temerarius ille, qui contra magnum ""Newtonum clausi reserantem scrinia veri"" dicere audet?(""What? Does he go on stage again, that exiled, imprudent, thoughtless man, who dares to speak against the great 'Newton, who opens the shrines of the locked truth'?"").In the course of the preface, Cominale also criticizes the flood of graphs in recent books on physics and makes a statement about his style of scientific writing, choosing to act as a philosopher rather than Cicero and to prefer the weight of argument to elegant expressions and beautiful periods. Nevertheless, Cominale relies on rhetorics to give emphasis to his argument, to his vindication oflibertas philosophandiand to his attacks on the Newtonians.",,"Cominale, Celestino‎(← links)","Cominale, Celestino:Anti-Newtonianismus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Anti-Newtonianismus(last revision: 25.01.2022).","Rather an encyclopedic work, as it presents an entire anti-Newtonian worldview, than a monograph.@OA: according to the title page, the fourth volume deals with tidesFirst volume.

In 18th- and 19th-century Sweden, this phenomenon was particularly widespread (Lindberg 2022, 209–214). Occasionally, their units of composition were aphorisms. This literary form had become popular in botany through Linnaeus'Fundamenta botanica. In the presentBotanical Aphorismsby Carl Adolf Agardh, professor of botany and economics at the University of Lund, all these trends combine. The work comprises a total of 310 aphorisms and 16 dissertations of 16 pages each, published over a period of ten years.  Originally, each dissertation was published separately, as evinced by their genre-typical title pages and dedications (not all of which are extant in the present copy). However, the consecutive pagination shows that they were planned to form part of a larger work from the outset, and so does the fact that the single dissertations often end in mid-sentence once 16 pages have been filled: apparently, Agardh did not compose them for the disputation at hand but had the entire work or at least parts of it ready and gave it to the printer piecemeal.In addition to the traits just mentioned, theBotanical Aphorismsare peculiar in at least two more respects: first, they are but a torso of a planned botanic encyclopedia that would have been of epic proportions. Aphorisms 13–19 in the introductory part subdivide the field of botany intotheoria(theory, comprising terminology and taxonomy)phytographia(phytography),physiology plantarum(physiology),historia vegetationis(plant geography),botanica oeconomica(plant economics),botanica medica(pharmacology), andhorticultura(horticulture or perhaps farming at large). However, after the introduction (aph. 1–19), only the first of these seven fields is discussed, and only the terminological part oftheoriais actually finished (aph. 20–123), whereas the larger part on taxonomy (aph. 124–310) literally ends in the middle of a word. Why the project was not pursued further is hard to tell. (Agardh eventually renounced his professorship and turned towards an ecclesiastic career, but this happened only in 1835; seeKrook 2022, 28.)Second, the work well exemplifies the almost complete evacuation of the notion of ""aphorism"" in later scientific writing (cf. August Tiemann'sDe visu aphorismifor a medical example). Admittedly, all the aphorisms from the introduction and some from the terminological section are true to their name. The very first one, for instance, is indeed a typical specimen of the genre, accurately and pithily stating a general idea:Natura est mundus quatenus viribus instructus vel complexus virium, quae materiae insunt.(""Nature is the world in its capacity of being provided with forces or the totality of the forces contained in matter."") The so-called aphorisms of the taxonomical section, by contrast, are in fact just descriptions and enumerations of taxa and their subgroups accompanied by general reflections; they are written in the highly technical idiom of post-Linnaean botany and often extend over several pages. The aphorism dedicated to theGramineae(today's Poaceae, the grasses), for example, runs over a full ten pages in small print (pp. 143–153). One wonders how a candidate could have shown his skills in scientific argumentation by defending such entirely non-argumentative texts.",,Fundamenta botanica‎(← links)De visu aphorismi‎(← links),"Agardh, Carl A.:Aphorismi botanici, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aphorismi_botanici(last revision: 21.06.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

However, the present work was not produced to provide guidance for botanical research but had a more modest goal: as explained in its short preface (pp. 3–4), it was conceived as a textbook. In this preface, which is addressed to Ludwig's students in Leipzig, the author declares that he has given ""private"", that is, extracurricular, lectures on botany over the last years and intends to continue with this. In the future, however, the present book shall become the foundation (fundamentum) of this teaching. Another point emphasized by Ludwig is that the individual aphorisms do not stand alone but form part of a carefully structured whole:In id semper incubui, ut concinno nexu veritates deducerem et ordine simul atque brevitate Vobis placerem.Moreover, the author promises that whatever remains unclear in the book will be orally explained in his lessons and illustrated in botanical excursions.The work itself, which is composed of 566 aphorisms on 80 octavo pages, lives up to the author's promises. As shown by the table of contents (pp. 5–6), it is clearly structured. After an introduction (prolegomena, pp. 7–15), in which a short history of botany (pp. 10–14) is of special interest, part one (pp. 16–42) is dedicated to methodology and systematics, part two (pp. 42–69), to plant anatomy and physiology, part three (pp. 70–80), to the medical use of plants. The microstructure is lucid as well, as the sequence of the single aphorisms always follows a coherent train of thought, just as in Linnaeus' work (but in contrast to collections like the HippocraticAphorismsor Cardano'sAphorismorum astronomicorum segmenta VII). The style is concise but simple and clear except for the technical terminology, which was presumably explained during the lessons. As an example, aphorisms 417–419 (pp. 62–63) may be adduced:417.Pulvere disperso non tantum antherae, sed et stamina integra exsiccantur, crispantur et decidunt.418.Pulverem fructus foecunditatem promovere et observationes et experimenta loquuntur.419.Pulvis non incongrue cum semine animalium prolifero comparatur; experimenta etiam omnimodam promittunt convenientiam.417. After the pollen has been dispersed, not only the anthers but also the stamina as a whole dry out, curl, and fall off.418. That the pollen fosters the fertility in terms of the fruit is proclaimed by observations and experiments alike.419. The pollen is quite fittingly compared to the offspring-bringing semen of animals; experiments point to a comprehensive analogy as well.In two of the three copies on display, the entire book is interleaved with empty sheets: two printed pages are always followed by two blank ones, which were obviously meant to give students the possibility to note down additional remarks and explanations by Ludwig.

A great number of poetic renderings had less lofty literary aspirations. Their authors rather aimed at making science easier to memorize and to learn, as had already been the case with many of their ancient and medieval predecessors. This particularly holds for medicine, which was in need of didactic tools much more than its fellow disciplines because it was taught at university since early on. Versifications of classical texts, for example from theCorpus Hippocraticum, were particularly popular. Among these texts, theAphorismstook pride of place.Seidenschnur 1847, 782–785 lists no less than 18 renderings into Greek and Latin verse (to which one may compare such rewritings in prose as the one to which theCircknizae descriptiois appended).TheAphorisms of Hippocrates Done into Verse, in which the single sayings are rendered into one or several elegiac couplets by a somewhat obscure physician from Verona, were posthumously edited by the author's nephew Giacomo and dedicated to Alberto Valier, titular bishop of Famagusta and coadiutor of the bishopric of Verona. The letter of dedication, the only introductory paratext apart from the title page, provides some background information. Shortly before his death, the uncle composed the present work, which was afterwards polished and edited at the request of numerous friends by the newphew. The epigrams not only render the aphorisms into Latin, they also elucidate the meaning of the Greek original, which is often obscure due to the latter's excessive brevity (cf.Rütten; Rütten 1998, 27 and 43 on ancient and early modern views of Hippocrates' style), and make it accessible to a broader readership:… divini Hippocratis Aphorismos soluta oratione conscriptos non modo carminibus reddidit, verum etiam verbis adeo conspicuis illorum sensum ob nimiam brevitatem admodum obscurum illustravit, ut quilibet vel mediocriter eruditus ipsum facillime percipere possit.What these assertions come down to in practice is best seen from a concrete example. The original ofAphorisms5.1 reads: Σπασμὸς ἐξ ἑλλεβόρου θανάσιμον, ""Convulsion from hellebore: deadly"". Dionysius expands this four words to a full elegiac couplet:Quicumque ellobori potu convellitur acris, / ponitur in mortis limine saepe miser.The number of words has nearly tripled, and the elliptic apophthegm has become a full-blown sentence including even a relative clause. Moreover, it is specified that the drug is taken orally as a drink (potu). Hippocrates' meaning is also expanded and modified in other respects: Hellebore is qualified as ""pungent"" (acris), and death ensues often (saepe), but not invariably. Death itself is circumscribed with the phrase ""to be put on the threshold of death"" (ponitur in mortis limine). Finally, the statement is personalized: in Dionysius' version, there is an (albeit anonymous) sufferer, and the poet evokes the reader's compassion for him by qualifying the sick man as ""wretched"" (miser).Appended to theAphorisms, one finds one of the abovementioned didactic epics, which discusses the eyes in some 300 hexameters (De oculis carmen).",Seidenschnur 1847,"Hippocrates‎(← links)Dionysius, Paullus‎(← links)De natura aquatilium carmen‎(← links)","Hippocrates; Dionysius, Paullus:Aphorismi Hippocratis versibus redditi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aphorismi_Hippocratis_versibus_redditi(last revision: 30.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

This work was known asFusul Musa(""Chapters of Moses"") in the Arabic tradition (for an English translation with annotations seeRosner 1984–1994, vol. 3). It is divided into a number of thematic sections, which collectively constitute a kind of short medical encyclopedia. When the collection was translated into Latin and printed in the present edition, the extracts were presented asAphorisms of Rabbi Moses Collected from Galenin analogy to the famousAphorismsof Hippocrates.Much is unclear concerning this Latin translation. Who is / are the translator(s) into Latin? Did he / they translate from Maimonides' Judeo-Arabic or from Galen's Greek? Is this the first Latin version ever produced? If not, was it freshly translated or was a previous translation reworked? Little is done to answer these questions in the following cryptical statement at the end of the anonymous preface to the reader:Quas cum multos iam annos intermissas ob rudioris ac minus politae dictionis fastidium boni hi viri viderent, utilitati medicorum consulentes poliendum ita et stylo et typis curarunt, ut vides …(""When these good men [who?] noted that the aphorisms had already been neglected [?] for many years, because people loathed their raw, unpolished style, they had them polished stylistically and typographically for the benefit of the physicians, as you see …""). The stylistic aspirations of the translation are underlined by two subsequent lists of ""barbarous words, which are properly rendered in this book"" and of quoted booktitles which are similarly emended. In both lists, each ""barbarous"" expression is confronted with a better one which is used in the present translation (e.g.selicha, melicratum), a feature which seems to indicate that one deals with the corrected version of an earlier translation. The lists are followed by the ""most copious index of all remarkable things"" announced on the title page, which indeed comprises 65 pages, and by three pages of errata.The translation fills nearly 500 octavo pages. Its single sections deal with 1. parts of the body, 2. humours, 3. the pulse, 4. urine, 5. signs of illness, 6. causes of certain illnesses, 7. the normal treatment of illnesses, 8. special treatments, 9. fevers, 10. the course of illnesses and crises, 11. bloodletting, 12. laxatives, 13. emetics, 14. surgery, 15. illnesses of women, 16. the preservation of health, 17. exercise, 18. baths, 19. food, 20. health-preserving medications, 21. simples, 22. definitions and distinctions of illnesses, and 23. astonishing phenomena which Galen has read in other medical writers. An aphorism typically comprises one ore two sentences in dry, but correct Latin. The Galenic work and book from which it has been taken is always indicated.Appended to the work, one finds two shorter texts: a discussion by Maimonides of passages in which Galen seems to contradict himself (counted as section 24 in the text but named as a separate work on the title page; pp. 492–527) and a collection of medical aphorisms by Yuhanna ibn Masawaih, which is however attributed to John of Damascus (pp. 528–42).",,"Galenus‎(← links)Maimonides, Moses‎(← links)","Galenus; Maimonides, Moses:Aphorismi Rabi Moysis ex Galeno collecti, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aphorismi_Rabi_Moysis_ex_Galeno_collecti(last revision: 02.07.2021).",The first ed. of this work appeared in 1489 already!

In the letter, de Conde states that his verse translation is helpful for memorizing the aphorisms, that it clarifies the sense of the original where necessary, also with the help of Galen's and other commentaries, and that it is more concise than the Greek text (breviores et succinctiores). The last point is remarkable, as most translations of theAphorismsactually expand the original, which was notorious for its brevity and the resultant obscurity. The index discloses the work's contents by dividing the aphorisms into sevenclasses(not to be confused with their seven books) dealing with (1) diagnosis and prognosis, (2) diet, (3) methods of treatment, (4) the influence of age, winds, and seasons, (5) fevers, (6) diseases of single body parts, and (7) 'external' diseases, which mainly regard the skin; eachclassisis further subdivided into sections such as (in the case of the lastclassis) hair problems, blisters, or tumors.The prose text renders the Greek more or less verbatim. The hexametric version is indeed remarkably concise, only comprising one single line in many cases. The fourteen Greek words of aphorism 2.47, for instance,Περὶ τὰς γενέσιας τοῦ πύου οἱ πόνοι καὶ οἱ πυρετοὶ συμβαίνουσι μᾶλλον ἢ γενομένου (""Pains and fevers occur rather during than after the formation of pus""),are quite faithfully rendered into ten words of Latin prose (only leaving out four articles) asDum pus fit, dolores ac febres accidunt magis quam confecto.Only one hexameter and seven words are needed in the verse translation:Et dolor et febris confecto pure remittunt(""Pain and fever abate after pus has formed"").The work apparently enjoyed some success. A second edition, bereft of the introductory paratexts but with the concluding index, appeared in 1669 (without indication of publisher and place) under the titleHippocratis Coi, medicorum principis, aphorismi aurei septem libris comprehensi, versu heroico explicati.

They became the object of literary imitation not only in medicine, but also in other disciplines like botany (see Linné'sFundamenta botanica) or astrology, as in Cardano's presentSeven Sections of Astrological[a possible meaning ofastronomicus]Aphorisms.Cardano makes it abundantly clear that he is following in Hippocrates' footsteps by imitating the latter's subdivision of his work in seven sections and by modelling his first aphorism closely on the famous opening statementVita brevis, ars longa …. There is no introduction of any kind, but the work is rounded off by a  ""concluding speech"" (operis peroratio,fols. 307r–309v), in which Cardano declares that he has defended astrology against unfounded criticism, integrated it into natural philosophy (effecimusque eam partem naturalis philosophiae) and turned it into an art that will remain valid forever (in artem redegimus sempiternam, fol. 307r). The rest of theperoratiois taken up by another vindication of astrology coupled with some prescriptions how to practice it.The seven sections fill about 200  quarto pages and comprise a total of 1173 (102 + 208 + 172 + 156 + 187 + 175 + 173) aphorisms. Most are concerned with natal astrology. Although some strings of aphorisms discussing similar topics can be found (e.g. 6.113–116: horoscopes indicative of foolishness), there seems to be nothing like an overarching order. Rather, characterisations of celestial bodies, rules of prediction, astronomical mathematics, epistemological principles and much more alternate in apparently arbitrary fashion. The reader finds it difficult to accept Cardano's assertion that he has transformed astronomy into anars, a true system of knowledge. The predictive rules, which account for the majority of the aphorisms, present a variegated panorama of human characters, actions, and destinies, which sometimes verges on the satirical, as in no. 6.113:Quando Venus cum Saturno fuerit et Mars et Mercurius in loco Lunae, natus erit stultus philosophum se putans.(""When Venus and Saturn come together and Mars and Mercury are in the place of the Moon, the boy born will be stupid but believe himself to be a philosopher."") In some respect, this example is representative of the style of the aphorisms as well: most are brief and terse, comprising between one and six lines. However, many presuppose so much factual and terminological knowledge as to become obscure to the uninitiated (e.g. no. 2.201:Directiones significant temporum generalium partes, alfridariae generalia tempora, sed revolutiones tempora propria uniuscuiusque rei). That this is done on purpose in order to imitate not only Hippocrates' conciseness, but also the difficulty for which he was famous and to emphasize Cardano's expertise and authority can be inferred from aphorisms like no. 3.107, in which the reaction of uncomprehending readers is anticipated. The aphorisms are interspersed with numerous horoscopes which provide exemplary confirmation of their truthfulness. Some additional horoscopes follow at the end (fols. 297v–306v). One also finds a few tables of astronomical figures of use in the casting of horoscopes.How seriously Cardano's aphorisms were taken by some is demonstrated by the present copy: a reader whose expertise is indicated by his routine use of astrological symbols has annotated it extensively.","Grafton 1999, 250–251","Cardano, Girolamo‎(← links)Grafton 1999‎(← links)Aphorismi botanici in usum auditorum conscripti‎(← links)","Cardano, Girolamo:Aphorismorum astronomicorum segmenta VII, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aphorismorum_astronomicorum_segmenta_VII(last revision: 27.12.2022).","Was Cardano a Copernican?

A complex system of brackets serves as an aid to understand the structure, although it is still a hard read. Around the central part there is a “frame” of overall 43 more paragraphs in a similar small font. There seems to be no obvious order or sequence in which these paragraphs and compartments should be read. As a general rule, the texts in the centre deal mostly with classification and taxonomy of bees, additional material is found in the paragraphs of the frame, although there are many digressions, allusions etc. The information given in the texts ranges from mythology, history and philology (most of it is typical apicultural lore since antiquity) to agricultural topics and new observations of the anatomy with the aid of the microscope. The queen bee is, however, still considered to be male and is – like in many ancient texts, especially Seneca’sDe clementia1.19.2–4, depicted as a good and mild ruler.

With the exception of the last four books of theConica(on which see below), all ancient texts are given not only in Latin translation, but also in the Greek original, the two languages standing side by side in parallel columns. Each book of Apollonius is introduced by the Lemmata pertaining to it in Pappus'Collectiones mathematicae(4th century CE). The commentaries by Eutocius (5th/6th century CE) are inserted after the respective propositions. The diagrams, vital to the understanding of the text, are lucidly printed. Books 5 to 7 of theConica, which are lost in the Greek original, are translated from the medieval Arabic version (which is itself not printed, however) of Thabit ibn Qurra. The lost book 8 is boldly reconstructed in Latin on the basis of the fact that Pappus gives the same lemmata as useful for the demonstrations in books 7 and 8, which hints at a close correlation between those two books (cf. part 2, p. 137). The volume is rounded off by a work by Serenus of Antiochia – thought in the 18th century to come from Antissa on Lesbos – on a subject similar to the one treated by Apollonius. Halley was the first to print the Latin translation along with the Greek original of both treatises.Halley apparently took the occasion to make many of his friends and colleagues happy, as he dedicated books 1-4, 5-7 and 8 of Apollonius and the work of Serenus to four different (groups of) people. From the preface to the volume as a whole, one learns much about its genesis: Originally, Halley should have translated and edited the Greek and Arabic texts in tandem with mathematician and astronomer David Gregory, but as his colleague died in the course of the work, Halley had to finish most of the job alone. They did not have to translate the first four books of theConicafrom scratch, but reworked the translation byFederico Commandino(Bologna 1566). For the translation of the Arabic parts, Halley could not rely on a real predecessor, since the two earlier Latin renderings at his disposal (one in manuscript and theApollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri V, VI, VIIbyBorelliandEcchellensis) were made from Arabic digests, not from a full version. However, Halley occasionally consulted the Borelli-Ecchellensis version. Moreover, he appears to have had access to some incomplete renderings made some decades earlier by English naturalists (Hall 1994, 154), although he does not say so in the preface.Today, Halley's effort is of interest not only as the engagement of a leading early modern scientist with one of the greatest mathematicians of antiquity. It also shows that in the early 18th century, very advanced philological skills and cutting-edge science could still be united in one and the same person. Until a decade ago (seeRashed; Decorps-Foulquier; Federspiel 2008–2010), his edition was the only complete one of the Greek and Arabic text.",Hall 1994,"Halley, Edmond‎(← links)Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri V, VI, VII‎(← links)Apollonius Pergaeus‎(← links)","Apollonius Pergaeus; Halley, Edmond:Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri octo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Apollonii_Pergaei_Conicorum_libri_octo(last revision: 27.11.2022).","On the second page of the preface, H. shows en passant his clear understanding of how manuscripts depend from each other.

It was Ferdinando who bought the respective Arabic manuscript which Borelli identified as books I to VIII of theConicamost probably recognizing many of the figures of the first four books because he had been silently involved with an edition ofMaurolico'sEmendatio et restitutio conicorum Apollonii Pergaei(Messina, 1654). In 1658, Borelli was allowed to visit the maronite scholar Abraham Ecchellensis in Rome in order to translate the manuscript which turned out to lack book VIII, though. The participants' claim to fame is not diminished by the fact that the Arabic source text is in fact a heavily edited abridgement of the original. A complete Arabic translation of the respective books was translated into Latin a few decades later byEdmond Halley(Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri octo).Before the reader gets to Apollonius's text, he encounters a multitude of introductory paratexts (all of which are unpaginated):A dedication written by Borelli praises the grand dukes of Tuscany and tells of the commission of the present work by Ferdinando.In compliance with a request of the censors (p. 414), the Christian reader is warned that some impious statements of the Muslim translator have been reproduced unchanged in the interest of philological accuracy. May his pious ears (piae aures) take no offence!In his proem, the Arabic translator-reviser glorifies the beauty and dignity of mathematics and explains that he has striven for brevity and terminological precision.An excerpt from Apollonius's own letter of dedication to Eudemus summarizes the contents of his last four books.Ecchellensis's preface starts from a praise of the zeal of his princely patrons for Arabic learning and a sketch of the aforementioned genesis of the book. He then describes the difficulty of reading the Arabic text, whose letters lack diacritical signs, and of rendering the technical terms. The harmonious and fruitful collaboration with Borelli is fondly remembered. After some words about the fate of theConicain the Arab world, the present Arabic version is called ""the most perfect and flawless of all"" (omnium perfectissima et absolutissima). Ecchellensis's own translation is rather literal. The Arabic text itself will be published soon. (This apparently never happened.)Borelli's preface to the reader characerises the Arabic translation better than Ecchellensis has done it: It is rather a paraphrase (paraphrasis) than a translationsensu strictoand it has changed the original order of the single propositions. Moreover, the manuscript is full of scribal errors. Borelli's notes will call attention to corrupt passages that have tacitly been emended in the main text, give information that is vital for the understanding but left out in the text and discuss further cases neglected by Apollonius. They are typographically set apart from the main text. Finally, Borelli explains why the three books in question should be regarded as basically genuine despite the changes they have undergone. vii. An index lists Apollonius' single propositions and details the way in which they have been rearranged in the Arabic version.While the existence of separate prefaces by the author Apollonius, by the Arabic editor al-Iṣfahānī and by one of the modern editors was clear, the separate prefaces of Borelli and Ecchellensis suprise and ""testify to the unusual nature of multiple authorship"" (Bertoloni Meli 2001, 75) during the early modern period which is also visible on the title page: Both appear as authors there.The three books of theConicathemselves are very carefully printed and equipped with precisely executed diagrams. Borelli's notes are considerably more extensive than Ecchellensis's translation (which, for unclear reasons, did not satisfy Halley, who in the preface to his edition complained that Ecchellensishaud ita commode traduxit). Both translation and notes exhibit the dry, impersonal, syntactically simple and uniform, lexically repetitive style that is a permanent legacy of the Greek mathematicians. Technical terms abound, many of which are explained in the stipulative definitions which open each of the three books. Some of these terms (e.g.brevisecans, p. 2, def. XIV) were presumably coined by Ecchellensis in the process of the translation.Appended to the three books of theConica, one finds on pp. 385–413 the Latin translation of Thabit ibn Qurra's Arabic translation of the shortLiber assumptorum(Book of Lemmas), a treatise on circles that builds on the discoveries made by Archimedes.","Bertoloni Meli 2001, esp. section 2, 71–75Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 2, 306–314 and vol. 19, 348–351.","Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri octo‎(← links)Borelli, Giovanni Alfonso‎(← links)Iṣfahānī, Abu-'l-Fatḥ Ibn Maḥmūd al-‎(← links)Abraham Ecchellensis‎(← links)Apollonius Pergaeus‎(← links)","Apollonius Pergaeus; Iṣfahānī, Abu-'l-Fatḥ Ibn Maḥmūd al-; Abraham Ecchellensis; Borelli, Giovanni Alfonso:Apollonii Pergaei Conicorum libri V, VI, VII, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Apollonii_Pergaei_Conicorum_libri_V,_VI,_VII(last revision: 02.12.2021).","Ferdinande commissioned Ecchellensis to translate it and Borelli to help him with the mathematics, and financed the print ?",MK,Yes,MK,

The presentApologetic Letter in Defense of the Arab Physicianslives up to its title only in part: despite some friendly words about Arab medical authors, it does not offer a fundamental vindication of Arab medicine in general; it also can hardly be called polemical. The letter rather seems to be intended as an example of how to discuss a point of factual disagreement respectfully and friendly.The letter's author, a young doctor from Tübingen who received his doctoral degree precisely in 1533, formerly enjoyed the teaching its addressee, the famous French physician Symphorien Champier (This presumably took place in an informal setting, since Champier did not hold a teaching position.) Accordingly, the letter is introduced and concluded by personal statements (fols. xvii v–xviii r, xix r–v), which take up nearly half of its five pages and address Champier in flattering terms likepraeceptor et pater iucundissime clarissimeque(""most friendly and famous teacher and father"", fol. xvii v) ordignitas tua(""your honour"", fol. xviii r). In the main part, Unger takes issue with one specific opinion upheld by Champier in hisCastigationes(1532) and hisHortus Gallicus(1533). The point of contention is formulated on fol. xviii r:Movet dignitas tua quaestionem in Horto tuo Gallico, simul ac Castigationibus tuis, num ex flava bile correpti febre medicamentis purgantibus curari debeant an cum solis alterantibus iuxta Galeni placita?In yourGaulish Gardenas well as in yourRebukes, your honour raise the question of whether patients who have contracted a fever caused by yellow bile should be treated with laxatives or only with medications changing their constitution according to Galen's opinion.Champier answered this question in the negative: due to their hot and dry nature, the respective laxatives would be liable to worsen the condition of a patient already suffering from an excess of heat. Unger concedes that the purgatives are indeed hot and dry and therefore potentially dangerous. However, he argues that the help brought by these drugs through the removal of noxious matter from the body exceeds the damage they do, which is why they should be applied nonetheless. The argument is largely conducted through quotations from ancient and medieval authorities, in which context the question of the worth of Arab medicine is occasionally touched upon. While Champier criticizes Avicenna as self-contradictory (taxas Avicennam tamquam sibi pugnantia scribat, fol. xix r), Unger heaps extravagant praise on Arab physicians, calling Mesue ""our evangelist"" (evangelista Mesue noster, fol. xviii v) and Avicenna ""king of medicine"" (monarcha medicinae, fol. xix r). However, such expressions should perhaps not be taken at face value, since they also correspond to Unger's striving for an elevated style in general, by which he presumably intends to do justice to the status of his addressee.The letter forms a small part ofa book dedicated to Champier in its entirety, whose first and longest section (fols. iii v–xiii v) is a series of critical comments by Sebastien de Monteux on Leonhard Fuchs'Errata medicorum recentiorum. Most of the rest of the volume is taken up by a series of letters, which partly respond to one another. Unger's letter to Champier in particular is immediately answered friendly, but firmly by its addressee: laxatives, Champier repeats, should be banned in the case of yellow bile fever, since they do more harm than good (fols. xx r–xxiii r), and Unger should return from the Arabs, from whom he has contracted such dangerous opinions, to the pure fountains of Greek medical wisdom.",,"Annotatiunculae in errata recentiorum medicorum‎(← links)Unger, Bernhard‎(← links)","Unger, Bernhard:Apologetica epistola pro defensione Arabum medicorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Apologetica_epistola_pro_defensione_Arabum_medicorum(last revision: 16.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It is addressed to Achille de Harlay, then president of the Parliament of Paris. Turquet de Mayerne was charged by the medical faculty of the University of Paris for his treatment of illnesses according to Paracelsian and alchemical principles, i.e. with the help of substances such as quicksilver, iron, or antimon. Turquet de Mayerne was accused that by this kind of treatment, he did no longer follow the principles of Galen and Hippocrates that were obviously still the eminent authorities in medicine at the University of Paris in this time.In the apology, that follows after the letter to Achille de Harlay, Turquet de Mayerne argues against the “false accusations by a certain anonymous person” (ad cuiusdam anonymi calumnias responsio apologetica) that his way of doing medicine is not directed against Galenic and Hippocratic principles, rather the contrary. As the author not only describes his own – quite prestigious – curriculum vitae (he wasinter aliathe physician of the French king Henry IV), but also how he prepared some drugs and how he has treated some of his patients, this apology is an interesting source for the medical practice at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The full name and the address of the patients are given so that they can be consulted. The Latin is clear but contains – given the topic – some technical terms, especially ofmateria medica. Turquet de Mayerne also uses quite a few Greek expressions, some of them are quotations, especially from theCorpus Hippocraticumand theCorpus Galenicum. But even those that are not direct quotations are sometimes in Ionic dialect, maybe to imitate the ancient medical writings. There are also some Latin quotations, e.g. from Vergil.

The present volume, which contains two ""apologies of Aristotle's teachings"" with regard to the Milky Way and the shape of the Moon, exemplifies his general approach.The intellectual background of theApologiais related to the famous Galileo-Cremonini controversy. As is well known, Cremonini deliberately distanced himself from the new cosmology of which Galileo was a distinct embodiment. The second part of theApologiaclearly refers to the noted episode when Cremonini refused to look through Galileo's telescope to observe the Moon. Therefore, the context of the text under discussion suggests that it should be regarded as a part, or to put it in a more correct chronological manner, ""predecessor"" of the Galileo affair of 1616.
In terms of its style and argumentative strategy, theApologiais a rather standard scholastic work. It suggests that there is no fundamental cause for substituting the Stagirite's authority, whose contribution Cremonini compares to what Dante had done in the field of Italian literature, with cosmological novelties. What Cremonini develops on the basis of these central premises is a meticulous interpretation of Aristotle's natural philosophy that he aims to adjust to a new scholarly reality. Although Cremonini's attempt proved false in the retrospect, theApologiaand his other texts, most of which similarly advocated the Stagirite against contemporary scientific tendencies, are indicative of an intense intellectual environment of early seventeenth-century Italy.",,"Cremonini, Cesare‎(← links)","Cremonini, Cesare:Apologia dictorum Aristotelis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Apologia_dictorum_Aristotelis(last revision: 17.10.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

Brissot had raised a debate over bloodletting because he argued in favor of letting the blood close to the infected organ. In this, he saw himself in line with Hippocrates and in opposition to the Arab tradition. Jérémy de Dryvère opposed Brissot in this procedure. As the title of this speech indicates (“Apology by Leonhart Fuchs against Jérémy de Dryvère, physician from Louvain, in which is demonstrated that in infections of internal organs, especially pneumonia, blood must be let from the affected side”), Fuchs belonged to Brissot’s ‘camp’.The volume is opened by a dedicatory letter to Fuchs’s friend Johannes Magebuch. In it, he reflects upon friendship, complains about the “barbaric” people of the Alps, with whom he lived at that time, and explains his motivation to write this apology. Already here, he criticizes de Dryvère fiercely.
Attached to theapologiais a short treatise by Fuchs’s friend Matthaeus Curtius, a physician at Bologna and, moreover, a supporter of Brissot, about a similar topic. As Fuchs states in the dedicatory letter, he has shortened and revised the treatise a bit:Quem utique libellum, ut gratior legentibus breviorque fieret, paulo Latiniorem fecimus, et si qua parum ad institutum faciebant, resecuimus. – “In any case, we have, in order to make it more pleasant to the readers and shorter, made this little book a bit more Latin and if some things had too little to do with the aim of it, we have cut it off.” Especially interesting is the quite rare comparative ofLatinusin this context. Just a few lines above, Fuchs has attackedinter aliade Dryvères use ofrevulsioandderivatio, words with a special meaning in the contexts of bloodletting, because he states that he could not have used them in a wrong sense – except on purpose – if he knew proper Latin (Accedit quod turpiter admodum in revulsionis et derivationis vocabulis hallucinetur, quorum certe genuinam vim, cum linguae Latinae probe peritus sit, ignorare non facile, nisi dedita opera, potuit.).

The Dominican friar and prolific Neo-Latin writer from Calabria wrote his manuscript while he was imprisoned in Naples. Tobias Adami, who brought a series of Campanella's works to the printing press in Frankfurt, also ensured the wider circulation of theApologia: in 1622, it was published as a quarto of 58 pages. Discussing the relationship between the heliocentric ideas promoted by Galileo and holy scripture, Campanella'sApologiais ""perhaps the culmination and philosophical synthesis of the passions, hopes and tragic disappointments that accompanied discussions of the legitimacy of Copernicus's teaching between 1615 and 1616"" (Omodeo 2014, 310).In the proem of theApologia, the central question is highlighted by a paragraph break and the use of maiuscle and italic letters:QUAERITUR ERGO utrum ratio philosophandi, quam Galileo celebrat, faveat sacris scripturis an vero adversetur(""THUS, THE QUESTION IS whether the way of philosophizing practiced by Galileo supports or opposes holy scripture.""). While this opening question points to a discussionin utramque partem,  the main title shifts the focus to the result of Campanella's discussion: Galileo should be free to explore the possibility of a heliocentric world. Campanella tackled the controversial topic in the traditional scholastic form of thequaestio. In this literary model, the question is formulated and followed by the contra arguments first and the pro arguments second, before it is answered in the voice of the author (e.g.respondeo, ""I answer""). The counter arguments are answered one by one (ad primum,ad secundumetc.).This is exactly the structure of theApologia. The first chapter presents eleven arguments against Galileo (pp. 7-8), the second chapter likewise eleven arguments in favour of Galileo (sed contra, pp. 9-11). In the central third chapter, Campanella proposes general principles for solving the debate (pp. 11-32). The fourth chapter  responds to the arguments from the first chapter against Galileo one by one (pp. 32-53), the fifth chapter responds to the arguments from the second chapter in favour of Galileo, often in groups (pp. 54-58). The five chapters are framed by a proem at the beginning and a valediction to the dedicatee, Cardinal Bonifazio Caetani, at the end. The paratext contains a preface by the printer and a short dedication letter by Campanella.The titleApologia pro Galileoseems to suggest an oration in defense of Galileo and thus a text informed by rhetorical force. However, Campanella'squaestiooffers a succinct argumentation in a crystal clear and familar structure that relies on the weight of examples rather than rhetorical emotion (in fact, Campanella had called his workApologeticus, notApologia). The sentences are often short and retain elements of medieval Latin, for example, the use ofquod-sentences instead ofaccusativus cum infinitivo(e.g.Recte ergo diximus, quod sine scientia non recte iudicet etiam sanctus, ""Therefore, we were right to say that without knowledge, not even a saint can pass correct judgement"", p. 13).The foil of thequaestiostructure highlights a striking element of theApologia: although Campanella introduces the third chapter with the set phraserespondebo(""I will answer""), he does not - at least not on the surface - assume the role of the judge, but rather designs a judge that is competent to answer the opening question: for example, this judge must possess both religious zeal and knowledge (scientia), be aware that astronomy is still developing and making progress, and understand that scientific errors are not necessarily heretical. In truth, Campanella voices his opinions in the third chapter, for example when he states:Quapropter delirant, qui putant ab Aristotele constitutam esse veritatem de caelestibus et nihil amplius investigandum.(""Therefore, those who believe that the truth about the celestial things has been established by Aristotle and no further investigations need to be done, are crazy."", p. 18) orEt falsitas in Galileo deprehendi non potest, quoniam ex observationibus sensatis in libro mundano procedit, non ex opinione.(""No falseness can be deteced in Galileo, since he advances from observations of the senses in the book of the world, not from opinion"", p. 30). But when he concludes that it could be detrimental to prohibit Galileo's studies and writings, he uses the cautious verbarbitor(""I believe"") and bows to the judgement of the church and ""better men"" in the final lines of the work (pp. 57-58).","McColley 1976,Lerner 2006(editions)Moss 1993, 149-68;Omodeo 2014, 309-18","Campanella, Tommaso‎(← links)","Campanella, Tommaso:Apologia pro Galileo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Apologia_pro_Galileo(last revision: 25.01.2022).","Notes on the preface of thetypographus(Adami?)Latin vs. vernacular: there is an Italian letter on the same topic, but it cannot be in the appendix of this book, because it’s not in Latin!

The print is unpaginated and -foliated, but a foliation has been provided by the owner of the copy in the municipal library of Augsburg, the German Cistercian Ambrosius Gemunder. This foliation is used in the following summary.The title page (fol. 1r) is followed by a dedicatory letter to the notables of the University of Salamanca (fols. 2r–3v), where Ciruelo had completed his studies, although he is currently teaching at Alcalá de Henares. With much autobiographical detail, the letter explains that as a mathematician and theologian, the author is competent to settle the strife between those upholding and those condemning the discipline as a whole (from the latter, he apparently had to suffer during his time in Paris). To this end, he has written a work on astrology that only maintains those parts acceptable for a good Christian, something already announced in the full title. The work's structure is explained as well. The letter is followed by a running-text table of contents (Index sive tabula omnium in hoc opere contentorum, fols. 4r–5v). The last paratexts before theApotelesmatathemselves are two long apologetic prologues. The first (fols. 6r–23v) provides a defense of judicial astrology, the second (fols. 23v–35v) is specifically directed against Pico della Mirandola'sfamous attack on astrologyand refutes its argument in general terms.The work itself (fols. 36r–122v) falls into four books in imitation of Ptolemy'sApotelesmatika(better known asTetrabiblos), as explained in an initialargumentum divisorium. Book 1 (fols. 36r–50v) provides some fundamentals, explaining key notions and introducing technical terms. Book 2 (fols. 51r–68r) discusses mundane astrology, book 3, the longest by far (fols. 68b–115b), nativities. The final book (fols. 116a–122v) is about electional astrology for farmers, physicians, and sailors. Each book is subdivided into chapters, whose contents are detailed further by partly numerated marginalia.The four books are followed by aCentilogium(Hundred Sayings, fols. 123r–141v) andResponsiones(Answers, fols. 142r–161v). As explained in a separate preface, the former text provides a summary of the preceding work, just as theCentiloquiumascribed to Ptolemy (cf. the commentariesby Georgius Trapezuntiusandby Giovanni Gioviano Pontano) was understood as a digest of hisTetrabiblos. TheCentilogiumfalls into four sections comprising 30, 30, 30, and ten aphorisms respectively, which correspond to the four books of theApotelesmata. Each aphorism is followed by an auto-commentary. TheResponsionespick up where the second prologue left off: the general arguments presented there against Pico are now complemented by a more detailed engagement with the allegations contained in his work, refuting them book by book and chapter by chapter. The volume is concluded by the colophon and a woodcut plus a religious epigram, in which the reader is encouraged to trust in the thorns of Jesus' crown as the porcupine trusts in his spikes (fol. 161v).As underlined by this finish, the most distinctive feature of Ciruelo's work is its Christian and moralizing outlook. Starting from the title and throughout the entire work, Ciruelo sharply distinguishes between good forms of astrology that are compatible with the Christian faith and morally unacceptable ones and restricts his treatment to the former, although he must have found it difficult to live up to his own standards on occasion. Book 4 in particular should not even exist according to the title page, where it is announced that the work will be about mundane astrology (de mutationibus temporum) and nativities (de genituris hominum) only. Ciruelo's distinction between legitimate and illegitimate varieties of elections at the beginning of this book is all the stricter and his concomitant condemnation of all kinds ofinterrogationesparticularly harsh (fol. 116r).In terms of content and train of thought, Ciruelo extensively discusses the different positions to be found in the tradition. As a rule, he follows Ptolemy as far as is possible in view of his own Christian agenda, while he is critical of the Arabs. The didactic content itself is mainly presented by way of subdivision and enumeration, as on fol. 88r, where it is discussed how people's native constellations influence their hair and what one can therefore learn from the latter about their character:Capillorum etiam quattuor sunt differentiae, scilicet grossi, subtiles, clari et obscuri. Grossi capilli et colore obscuri magnam virtutem cerebri et fortitudinem phantasiae complexionemque melancholicam ex commixtione Saturni et Mercurii significant. Capilli vero tenues et nigri atque plani phlegmaticam complexionem ex constellatione Veneris et[the print'sautprobably is a misprint]Lunae ostendunt. Si autem tales capilli fuerint crispi, siccam complexionem et choleram temperatam habent ex Mercurio a Iove fortunato …Also regarding the hair one has four different categories: thick, thin, light, and dark. Thick, dark hair indicates a great capacity of the brain, a strong imagination, and a melancholic temper because they result from a mixture of Saturnus and Mercury. Thin, dark, and straight hair, however, indicate a phlegmatic temper because of the united influence of Venus and the Moon. But if such hair is curly, people have a dry temper and a moderate measure of bile from Mercury, who is under the lucky influence of Jupiter …","Hasse 2016, 254–272 (discussion of some disputed questions in contemporary astrology by Ciruelo and others)",,"Ciruelo, Pedro:Apotelesmata astrologiae Christianae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Apotelesmata_astrologiae_Christianae(last revision: 18.11.2021).","The title seems based on a misunderstanding of the title of Ptolemy'sApotelesmata, whereapotelesmameans ""celestial influence"".NEED TO FIND THE COPY OF THE GERMAN MONK!CONTINUE WITH CENTILOGIUM",MK,Yes,MK,

In retrospect, by contrast, it is regarded as epoch-making. After some 2000 years of discussion aboutEuclid'sparallel postulate, Bolyai demonstrates that it is independent of Euclid's four other postulates; that its correctness or incorrectness cannot be proven, but may or may not be assumed; that geometries may be designed in which this postulate is not valid; and that an 'absolute' geometry (a notion coined by Bolyai in §15) exists which simply disregards it. Together with Nikolai Lobachevsky, János Bolyai was the first to publish insights of this kind.Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been thinking in similar directions for some time but published nothing (apart from the implicit consequences of his ""intrinsic geometry"" developed in theDisquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas), acknowledged the worth of Bolyai's work in a letter. Gauss was probably reluctant because of Kant's dictum that physical space isa prioria Euclidean space. Bolyai's article thus can also be viewed as one of the steps of emancipation of mathematics from philosophy or physics: geometry is not the description or idealization of physical space, it is ""only"" a mathematical discipline.The text opens without any declaration of its aims, methods, and novelty. Perhaps Bolyai thought the full title sufficient in this respect:Appendix Presenting a Science of Space Which Is Absolutely True and Not Dependent on the Truth or Falseness of Euclid’s 11th Postulate, About Which No A Priori Decision Can Ever Be Made. For the Case of Falseness, a Geometrical Squaring of the Circle Has Been Added. After a list of novel or less common mathematical symbols (e.g.,o r[sc.denotet]pheripheram circuli radii r, ""Leto rdenote the circumference of a circle with radiusr""), the text is divided into 43 paragraphs. In many passages, reference is made to a set of 23 diagrams, which are unfortunately hidden away at the very end of the second volume of Farkas Bolyai's textbook. The Latin is terminologically precise and uniform, the same notion being always expressed with the same word, as well as syntactically simply. Paratactical and hypotactic conjunctions are used with great accuracy to spell out the train of thought. They serve, for instance, to express the transition from cause to consequence (adeoque,idcirco), the equality of alternative systems (num … aut), or the truth of different statements under different preconditions (si … si vero; all from § 33). That the text remains opaque to the non-expert is due not to its language or style, but to the previous knowledge assumed on the part of the reader, the complexity of the argument, and the formulaic expressions which take up about one-half of the space. If all of these obstacles give way for a moment, the text may indeed become quite clear (§ 33 again):Num Σ aut S aliquod reipsa sit, indecisum manet.(“If Σ [the system of Euclidean geometry] or any S [system of hyperbolic geometry] does in fact apply remains undecidable.”)Only in the late 1860ies theAppendixwas fully acknowledged: Translations into French and Italian appeared and Beltrami and Klein presented ""models"" for Bolyai's hyperbolic geometries demonstrating they could be physically implemented.Some seventy years after its original publication, theAppendixwas reissued by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences together with Farkas Bolyai's entire textbook. A separate facsimile edition with introduction, Hungarian translation (with the diagrams helpfully integrated into the text), and commentary came out in 1952. In 1987, this edition was updated and translated into English (Kárteszi; Szénássy 1987).","Kárteszi; Szénássy 1987Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 2, 269–271","Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas‎(← links)Bolyai, János‎(← links)","Bolyai, János:Appendix scientiam spatii absolute veram exhibens, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Appendix_scientiam_spatii_absolute_veram_exhibens(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Of these, Rondelet's work appears perhaps most impressive to a modern reader: it is more comprehensive than Belon's and Salviani's account and less doxographical, more autopsy-based and more meaningfully structured than Gessner's alphabetically ordered encyclopedia.TheHistory of Water Animalscomprises two beautifully illustrated volumes and nearly one thousand folio pages. The volumes are actually titled differently from one another. While the title of vol. 1 speaks ofpisces(""fish""), the title of vol. 2 hasaquatilia(""water animals""). This indecision reflects the transition from the old use ofpiscisdenoting any animal living in the water to the more restricted modern one. Both volumes are lavishly equipped with introductory paratexts: privilèges du Roy, letters of dedication, prefaces to the reader as well as Latin and Greek poems of praise for the author and his work (including the elegyAd Gulielmum Rondeletiumby as certainPetrus Costusas well as another elegy byCharles de l'Ecluse). Vol. 1 also features a table of contents, as mentioned on its title page. Each volume is concluded by two indexes of interesting subjects and of the names of the respective water animals.The work itself begins with four books discussing water animals in general. Rondelet tries out numerous criteria of classification, from habitat and breathing to anatomy and taste. After this introduction, books 5–18 of vol. 1 and the seven unnumbered books of vol. 2 are dedicated to various kinds of water animals. The question in which order they should be presented caused Rondelet quite a headache (multum diuque cogitavi, vol. 1, p. 113). He finally decided to begin with the gilt-head bream (aurata), because it was the best-known fish, and to let the other fish follow in descending order of similarity. An alphabetical order is emphatically rejected (pp. 113–14). The result is a macrostructure in which marine animals (but also some fresh water animals) with blood come first (vol. 1, books 5–16), followed by other sea animals such as molluscs and crustaceans (vol. 1, book 17 – vol. 2, book [3]). The last four books are dedicated to animals living in brackish and fresh water and finally to amphibious animals (not amphibians in the modern sense; see pp. 236–42 for the beaver, for example). Within this overall framework, single books may be dedicated to categories such as very small fish, flat fish or outlandish and rare fish (vol. 1, chs. 7, 11, 15).The single entries comprise a woodcut followed by a description. As explained at p. 114 of vol. 1, a standard entry starts from the respective animal's names in Greek, Latin (often imposed by Rondelet, who also explains his reasons) and the vernaculars, followed by its appearance and anatomy. Next, its behaviour is described. Finally, Rondelet details the medical and culinary uses of the animal, including the ways to catch and prepare it, if appropriate. However, this formula is varied freely. The information given is based on autopsy, ancient authors (quoted in Latin and in Greek with Latin translation) or a combination of both. Rondelet writes a simple style, eschewing complex hypotaxis and showing a preference for short main clauses instead. His descriptions are graphic and vivid. About thevera balaena(""true whale,"", perhaps the humpback whale), for instance, one learns inter alia that… lingua quoque minor, utpote quae quattuor dumtaxat vel quinque salsamentaria vasa impleat. … clamant vel mugiunt tam magno et contento sono, ut qui binis Gallicis miliariis absunt audire possint. … parvulos pinnis suis tegit ac tuetur mater.(vol. 1, p. 482; ""… its tongue is smaller [than in other whales] as well: it only fills four or five salting vessels. … they clamour or moo so loud and intensely that people who are two French miles away can hear them. … the mother covers and protects the little ones with her fins."")The work was a success, and its contents proved of interest beyond the members of theres publica litterarumwho knew Latin. In 1558, Bonhomme, who had published the original, brought out an abbreviated French translation titledHistoire entière des poissons. In the same year, François Boussuet authored theDe natura aquatilium carmen, an epigrammatic digest of the work, which was printed by Bonhomme as well. Moreover, the Latin edition was integrated piecemeal into Gessner's book on water animals (see the respective digital copy).","Gudger 1934, esp. 28–30Bäumer 1991–1996, 360–368Pinon 1995, 88–89","Rondelet, Guillaume‎(← links)De natura aquatilium carmen‎(← links)Ad Gulielmum Rondeletium‎(← links)","Rondelet, Guillaume:Aquatilium historia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aquatilium_historia(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

He thus employs contemporary scientific methods and knowledge to show how a religious text can be accepted as a historically correct report.The work is dedicated to Charles II of Spain who is also depicted in the frontispiece. After the letter of dedication follows a shorter preface to the reader in which Kircher explains the rationale of his work and gives an overview of the content. Moreover, he states that he has included a fair number of pictures, but these only serve illustration and he warns against taking them as reliable sources of knowledge (Quod deinde in iconimis operi insertis nonmulla libertate usus fuerim, ea prudentem lectorem tamquam certa et indubia, minime censere velim; fol. **3r). After the preface, there is a table of content.The work itself is divided into three books that deal with the time before, during, and after the Deluge respectively. Books one and three are further divided by subsections. The first book comprises just short of 120 pages, almost half of the main part of the work.SectioII of the first book deals with the prehistory of the Deluge and discusses rather questions of morality that lead to the Deluge.SectioII addresses technical questions concerning the ark, such as the materials and tools used to build it, its form and measurements.SectioIII then deals with the animals that were included in the ark and where their stables were. In this passage, Kircher also discusses which animals could be excluded from the ark, for example, because they could swim, allegedly did not reproduce sexually but through spontaneous generation (e.g., some insects and reptiles), or are hybrids (Capanna 2009, 47–49;Enenkel 2014, 104–110). In his chapter on hybrids (p. 67–70), he not only presents real hybrids such as the mule, but mostly those that he thought to be hybrids such as thecamelopardalis(i.e., giraffe, from camel and pardalis) or the armadillo (allegedly from hedgehog and turtle). Moreover, there are some fabulous ‘animals’ such as the unicorn or the sirene. There is a table containing the names of animals in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic-Syrian, and Arabic (p. 101 f.). A highlight of this work is surely thepinax stabulorum, a schematic layout of the ark and its stables between pages 108 and 109.Book two deals with the events during the Deluge, beginning with the congregation of animal species to be included in the ark. Kircher also addresses the questions of where the water came from and were it went, discusses ancient texts on floods (such as the myth of Deucalion and Pyrrha), and makes some hydrostatic calculations on the weight of the ark and its draught. Furthermore, there is a mystic-allegorical interpretation and anappendix erotematicawhere Kircher discusses some further problems relating to the interpretation of the biblical text.The last book contains the events after the Deluge beginning with Noah leaving the ark. Kircher also discusses questions such as if eating animals started before or after the Deluge (most likely before, according to Kircher), if there were rainbows already before God announced it as a sign of his union with humankind (yes, of course, according to Kircher), or if the paradise on earth has been destroyed by the Deluge. An important part deals with the question how animals and also humans could populate the Earth again and how they could reach distant islands and continents. Kircher’s answer to the latter question is that sea level was much lower after the Deluge and thus there were ‘bridges’ between the continents and many islands were still connected to the mainland.Kircher also discusses the re-beginning of culture and the first writings after the Deluge. The last chapter is about Noah’s death and even contains an epitaphium. This is followed by a picture of genealogical tree, a chronological table, an alphabetic index, a table of figures, and some errata. At the very end, there is a list of Kircher’s works both already printed and planned compiled by the publisher, apparently to serve as advertisement just as we know it from modern books and also from, e.g.,Haec opera.
The text is written in good Latin style although there are many newly coined terms especially from Greek stems, as is characteristic for Kircher. Different versions (Hebrew, Greek, Chaldaic, Syrian, Arabic) of the biblical account are discussed at various places throughout the work, but Chaldaic, Syrian, and Arabic texts are usually translated into Latin.","Browne 1983, 3–8.Asúa; French 2005, 171–174.Capanna 2009, 47–49.Enenkel 2014, 104–110.","Kircher, Athanasius‎(← links)Haec opera‎(← links)","Kircher, Athanasius:Arca Noe, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Arca_Noe(last revision: 18.03.2022).",,DB,Yes,DB,

This work aimed at providing a method for the determination of the proportion of the volumes of different components in a compound body by finding out how much weight this body lost when submerged in water, but failed to reach this goal. De Mello successfully set out to rewriteDe ponderibusso that the stated goal could be achieved. In his rewritten version, the text falls into two parts: 1) a short introduction containing a number of definitions and postulates (e.g. ""every body weighs more in air than in water""); 2) seven propositions, i.e. considerations or questions, each of which is subdivided in theorems, problems, lemmata and/or corollaries; in the last proposition, the initial question is solved.The short work is interesting for the following reasons: a) It exemplifies the composite nature of some early modern scientific writings, as it contains a conceptual kernel from Archimedes'De corporibus fluitantibus, the medieval elaboration / depravation of this kernel and the latter's early modern reelaboration / rectification. b) It is a good example of the very common 'Euclidean' structuring of scientific texts with the help of sections entitled definitiones, postulata, proposition, theorema, lemma, corollarium, etc. c) At a comparatively early date, it already uses the letters of the alphabet to indicate volumina, weights, etc.De Mello's work was not printed in the early modern era but has only been preserved in the form of a manuscript dedicated to king Manuel I of Portugal (which is why we cannot present a digital copy).

In fact, it is a careless print of a depravated manuscript of the translation made in 1269 by William of Moerbeke (Clagett 1964–1984, vol. 2, part 1, p. 72), who had himself not really understood what he translated. Under these circumstances, it comes as no suprise, that many passages are unintelligible in the print; for example, already the first sentence of the dedication to Dositheus becomes meaningless gibberish. The often misleading interpunction makes it hard to grasp the syntax. Regarding the technical vocabulary, there is considerable confusion, too; the crucial ἐπίτριτος (""bigger by one third""), for instance, is enigmatically rendered asepitricusorepytricusthroughout. The high number of typos is not helpful, either. There are many lettered diagrams, to which the text constantly refers, but they are often oversimplified (half-circles instead of parabolas) and sometimes lack crucial letters.It is all the more remarkable that this sorry effort actually paved the way for the intellectual mastering and retrieval of Archimedes' treatise. In Niccolò TartagliasOpera Archimedis(1543), the translation itself is based on Gaurico's edition, which is corrected only very selectively, but the diagrams now show parabolas throughout, which proves that Tartaglia had been able to achieve a correct understanding of the work on this shaky basis.","Clagett 1964–1984, vol. 3, part III, ch. 4.2.","Archimedes‎(← links)Gaurico, Luca‎(← links)De dimensione parabolae‎(← links)","Archimedes; Gaurico, Luca:Archimedis Syracusani Tetragonismus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Archimedis_Syracusani_Tetragonismus(last revision: 09.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,MK,

In his letter of dedication to Pierre Brûlart, a highly ranked courtier at the royal court, De Roberval states that Brûlart andMarin Mersennehad come across an Arabic version of the treatise and induced a speaker of Arabic to translate it into Latin. The resulting barbarious version was then given to De Roberval, who polished it and added a number of notes.The treatise is, without a doubt, a forgery made by De Roberval himself in order to confirm his commitment to heliocentrism. To make the forgery more credible, he did not accompany the argument with any graphs; however, all significant mathematical details on the motion of the celestial spheres and planets are explained through some short (a few lines to three pages) notes. In these notes, De Roberval expresses himself as being quite sceptical in what is concerned with a perfect and final science of planetary movementsper seand, therefore, claims to remain a moderate proponent of heliocentrism. The whole enterprise, including De Roberval's idea to hide his identity behind the ancient astronomer's treatise, demonstrates his cautious approach. The tone of the notes also fits this trend. However, written in early seventeenth-century France, De Roberval's forgery could be put in a broader intellectual context in relation to other writings of the day that discussed, first, the question of authority and, second, the very reliability of theCopernican turn. Thus, the eclectic text that drew uponCopernicus,Keplerand other contemporary cosmological theories, and denounced in a peculiar way the arguments of non-Copernicanists, illustrates how sceptical about the new theory early modern scholars were in the first half of the seventeenth century.",Babeş 2020,"De Roberval, Gilles Personne‎(← links)","De Roberval, Gilles Personne:Aristarchi Samii De mundi systemate, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aristarchi_Samii_De_mundi_systemate(last revision: 15.12.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

On the one hand, Wallis broke conventions on traditional mathematical style and reasoning, incurring severe criticism from contemporary mathematicians likeFermatandHobbesfor his lack of rigour. On the other hand, theArithmetica infinitorumreveals the thought process of its author – unusual for mathematics, but typical for other disciplines in this period – and presents a surprising and beautiful result: an infinite product representation of π which is today known as the Wallis product.ContentAfter the title page, the work starts with a dedicatory epistle (dated to 19th July 1655, Julian calendar) to William Oughtred, which gives the reader a good impression of the genesis of the work and provides a philosophical and epistemological background. Wallis' main source of inspiration wasEvangelista Torricelli'spresentationofBonaventura Cavalieri'smethod of indivisiblesfor finding areas of figures and volumes of geometrical bodies. This method was based on the search for proportions of the lengths of infinitely many line segments of geometric figures to those of figures of known area. Wallis concluded that he had to search for these proportions in a systematic way. This ultimately led to the study of various series of numbers, their sums, and proportions. The squaring of the circle, however – which Wallis achieved only in an arithmetical way and not by means of straightedge and compass – required another idea, of finding 'suitable' intermediate terms of given sequences.It is this question of intermediate terms Wallis had distributed as a kind of ""teaser"" and advertisement for his work and placed it in the book directly after this dedicatory letter. Given the sequence ""1,6, 30, 140, 630,et cetera"", what is the correct number to insert between 1 and 6, 6 and 30, and so on? Wallis talks about a continuous curve through the givenordinateswith evenly spacedabscissae. This idea of curve fitting he later calls ""interpolation"", today aterminus technicusfor such a method. How the solution of this question should yield the promised squaring remains open at this point.In the main body of the work, Wallis investigates the behaviour of certain sequences of numbers. For his method be ""inquiry"" and ""induction"", he gives some examples and from them guesses the general rule. Often he writes after these examples that the rule is ""clear from what has gone before"". After each investigated class of sequences, several geometric examples are presented. He solves many cases which are already well-known (like the areas of a triangle or a parabola segment, the volume of a pyramid or cone). These examples might also have served as a testing field and a further argument for the correctness of his method (Stedall 2001, 3).Testing and extending various cases of sequences Wallis proceeds from sums of natural (squares, cubes, etc.) to sums of fractional powers (proposition 53) and even of negative powers, that is, powers of reciprocals (proposition 87), always applying his findings to area calculations.After this first part, the obtained results are used in order to determine the area of the quarter circle. The idea is a generalization of the algebraic expression of the circle curve, which involves a square root, with the help of two parameters. For many values of these two parameters, the expression can now be determined by the aid of the previous results which are summed up in a table. For the missing ones - the lines in between (one of which represents the quarter circle) - Wallis employs his method of continuous interpolation.
Finally, he squeezes the value between two expressions of consecutive multiplications whose distance can be made arbitrarily small and determines thus the value of π by means of an infinite product.Reactions and ImpactAs was to be expected, the work found many critics. Among them wasFermat, who, as a reaction to theArithmetica infinitorum, created himself a manuscript on quadrature, theDe aequationum localium transmutatione et emendatione. Also, asHuygensnoted in a letter tovan Schootenconcerning the interpolation method, fitting a continuous curve through given points always has several (in fact infinitely many) solutions so that such a question is certainly not well-posed (Rampelt 2019, 189–190). 
The most fierce criticism, however, Wallis encountered from a fellow citizen,Thomas Hobbes. This controversy went far beyond mathematical and philosophical issues and resulted in personal accusations.Other British scientists, by contrast, stood in favour of the ""new mathematics"": By his experimental method of induction, Wallis was able to integrate mathematics, often perceived as too dogmatic before, into the newly founded Royal Society (Alexander 2014, 276). The fellows' principles of experiment and discourse had been incompatible with mathematical practice. Wallis's induction method left room for interpretation, personal skills to find the right solution, and the modest recognition that no absolute truths were presented.TheArithmetica infinitorumdefinitely had a huge impact on the development of infinitesimal calculus. First of all,Newtontook inspiration from Wallis's progressions and developed several power series based on similar principles (Stedall 2001, 23). The inductive method became a fruitful tool for the generation of new results (or, to be more correct: hypotheses) and sped up the development of mathematics. Finally, Wallis coined new notations and contributed to establishingDescartes'sanalytic geometry and algebraic notation. Moreover, the Cartesian equality sign is already replaced by the modern one in his work.Alongside theArithmetica infinitorum, Wallis published several other short treatises, among them his treatise on conic sections (De sectionibus conicis tractatus).","Cantor 1880–1908, vol. 2, 899–905Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 14, 148–149Stedall 2001Beeley 2013Alexander 2014, esp. 264–274Rampelt 2019","Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica‎(← links)Methodus fluxionum et serierum infinitarum‎(← links)Wallis, John‎(← links)De aequationum localium transmutatione et emendatione‎(← links)Examinatio et emendatio‎(← links)De terminis generalibus serierum‎(← links)Introductio in analysin infinitorum‎(← links)Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum promota‎(← links)Novum Organum‎(← links)","Wallis, John:Arithmetica infinitorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Arithmetica_infinitorum(last revision: 23.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,
"Stifel, Michael",Arithmetica integra authore Michaele Stifelio. Cum praefatione Philippi Melanchthonis,,1544,Nuremberg,Petreius,16th century,"Textbook, Commentary, Encyclopedic work",Mathematics,Arithmetica integra(e-rara)Alternative link:Google Books,915240,"Michael Stifel’sArithmetica integracovers the status of arithmetics and algebra of the time. Although the invention and publication ofCardano’ssolution of the cubic equation in theArs magnaof 1545 outdated Stifel’s account to some respect, it still has to be acknowledged for the systematic and comprehensive presentation on the one hand, and for Stifel’s many original contributions on the other hand.Stifel dedicates his work to Jakob Milich, a professor of mathematics in Wittenberg who had played a decisive role in Stifel’s interest for mathematics and the publication of theArithmetica integra. This is preceded by a praefatio byPhilipp Melanchthon. Anindex capituminforms the reader about the structure: Three books, subdivided in several chapters.The first book teaches the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and basic operations. Algorithms are explained by using complicated numbers which are designed to cover all peculiarities that can occur during calculations. Simplifying fractions is justified by referring to Euclid'sElements. Further topics are divisibility rules, arithmetic, geometric and other progressions, figurate and pyramidal numbers as well as magic squares. An appendix to the first book is dedicated to the moecenates Adolf of Glauburg and treats theregula falsi. Stifel explicitly mentions the printer Petreius suggesting to include it in the work.Book II starts with another dedication to Jakob Milich and a discussion whether irrational numbers are numbers or not. By a scholastic “sic et non” discussion Stifel first presents arguments why they deserve a status as numbers but then the more substantial ones, why they should not. In this chapter he manages to give an algorithm for listing all rational numbers between 2 and 3 foreshadowing Cantor's considerations on cardinality in the 19th century. In the following chapters, book X of Euclid’s Elements is thoroughly studied. Stifel is considered to be the first mathematician since antiquity who understood this difficult book which classifies irrationalities. Putting the classical geometric account into an arithmetic language facilitated its approach (Alten et al. 2003, 256).Book III is on algebra or theregula Gebri, as Stifel also calls it, erroneously attributing the rules to Geber Hispalensis (Jabir ibn Aflah). It starts with another dedication to Jakob Milich and covers reckoning with “cossic numbers” (symbols for powers of the unknown) and solutions of algebraic equations. He introduces the exponent of an unknown (this notion is his invention, for the first time appearing on fol. 235v). He aligns the cossic symbols with their respective exponent and prefers to reckon with the exponents. For example, if we wants to multiply ""4 zensi"" with ""3 cubi"" (which is ""12 surdesolidi"") - he adds the exponents 2 (""zensus"", sic!) and 3 (""cubus"") and looks up the cossic symbol of the exponent 5, the ""surdesolidus"". In chapter 4, Stifel takes “roots of cossic numbers”, which means, he is solving quadratic equations. By accepting negative coefficients of equations, the traditional case distinction of several types of equations becomes obsolete and quadratic equations are solved by one general rule – the AMASIAS rule:A numerum radicum incipe, eumque dimidiatum […].Multiplica, dimidium illud positum, quadrate.Adde vel Subtrahe iuxta signi additorum, aut signi subtractorum, exigentiam.Invenienda est radix quadrata, ex summa additionis tuae, vel ex subtractionis tuae relicto.Adde aut Subtrahe iuxta signi aut exempli tui exigentiam.What is meant by these prompts becomes clear by the follow-up examples and is exactly the formula for the solutions of a reduced quadratic equation - only in verbal form.First and foremost, the use of negative coefficients is “useful” for Stifel. Therefore, he explores the rules of reckoning with negative numbers which he callsnumeri absurdiornumeri ficti infra nihil. Their status as numbers is certainly doubted. But as another example for the usefulness of negative numbers, Stifel extends the assignment of the geometric and arithmetic progression to negative numbers in the arithmetic, and the corresponding fractions in the geometric progression. Using the geometric progression of powers of 2, he finds a correspondence of 1/8 and -3 and of 64 and 6. This is used to calculate the product of 1/8 and 64 (which is 8) simply by adding the “exponents” 6 and -3 (which is 3 – the “exponent” of 8). Stifel thus was able to reduce certain multiplications to the addition of the corresponding exponents. This is certainly a first step in the development of logarithms and the inventors oflogarithms, Jobst Bürgi andJohn Napierare known to be familiar with theArithmetica integra.Stifel also introduces capital letters A, B, C, … in order to distinguish between several unknowns and combines them with cossic symbols if he wants to express higher powers. With this new tool he is able to concisely formulate and treat systems of equations with several unknowns. 
Book three is concluded by chapters of examples complementing the previous theoretical chapters. The last chapter ends with a prayer – but the last book ends with yet another appendix dedicated to Adolf of Glauburg.Stifel writes in a clear and instructive style and shows himself as a learned man. He is aware of scholastic tradition and knows the relevant literature of the field, includingEuclid’sElementsin the edition ofCampanus, the Arithmetic of Boetius and Jordanus Nemorarius (these are antique or medieval sources) as well as the “Coss” by Christoff Rudolff, the “Rechenbuch” of Adam Ries and the Practica arithmeticae by Girolamo Cardano, and he is not reluctant to cite his sources even in his chapter headings. Although Cardano’sArs magnawhich incidentally appeared only one year later outshone Stifel’s work by the first publication of the solution of cubic equations, theArithmetica integrahas its own merits, not least the unconcerned treatment of negative numbers, the explication of exponents and the first steps in logarithmic calculations. It is hard to assign a genre. At the beginning it is probably best described as a textbook, whereas becoming more and more a scientific work with a commentary of Euclid’s tenth book in the middle and a presentation of algebra containing many novelties in the end but always keeping an eye on learners (which, for example, can be seen by the amount of examples covering six chapters in the third book). Not least due to the comprehensible presentation of these topics, the work experienced such dissemination that later editions were issued (1545, 1546, 1548 and even in 1586).","Reich 1989Gericke 1990(242-251)Gärtner 2000, 255Alten et al. 2003, 255-257Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 13, 58-62",Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio‎(← links)De occulta parte numerorum‎(← links),"Stifel, Michael:Arithmetica integra, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Arithmetica_integra(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,

These figures sound more impressive than they actually are, however, since most books are rather short and the text of all 29 books together only fills 190 quarto pages. The mathematical level is fairly elementary throughout. The Latin style is simple, the numerous diagrams well executed, the layout neat.As stated in the preface to the reader, this work forms part of Ramus' ambitious didactical agenda to overcome the Aristotelian and Euclidean ancient Greek traditions which, according to him, blur mathematical understanding. In his attempt to cleanse mathematics from what he judged unnecessary, Ramus included only practically applicable material, kept a brief and simple style and banned theoretical results and especially proofs from his work. The books can be understood as compendia containing useful facts on certain topics: the geometric books start with general results for quantities, followed by lines, angles, geometrical shapes, triangles, and so on. In books VI to VIII for example, one can find all results on triangles.Despite his harsh criticism of Euclid for being too difficult, too theoretical and questionably organized, Ramus trustfully used results from the Elements as facts and just organized them in a more didactical order. It can be doubted, though, that Ramus fully understood theElementsbecause there are a number of logical flaws due to oversimplifications. With this rearrangement Ramus opposed the common presentation of theElementsin the 16th century, which  neglected the proofs and thus appeared as an incoherent salmagundi of results.The first version of the mathematical part was printed as early as 1555. There one can find also books on algebra, but Ramus later judged this field to be useless. Therefore, arithmetic and geometry are the two disciplines printed in the later editions. Three more editions (1580, 1599, 1627) attest the favour Ramus found for making mathematics understandable. Ramus's work was hotly debated among contemporaries and criticized by modern mathematicians. Nevertheless, the concept found followers likeThomas Finck, author of aGeometria Rotundiwhich is based on Ramus's geometry.","Cantor 1880–1908, vol. 2, second ed., 563–565Verdonk 1968","Ramus, Petrus‎(← links)Geometria rotundi‎(← links)","Ramus, Petrus:Arithmeticae libri duo, geometriae septem et viginti, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Arithmeticae_libri_duo,_geometriae_septem_et_viginti(last revision: 10.06.2021).","Not a textbook in the sense that is written for a particular didactic use or results from a certain teaching activity; but in the sense that its author wants to renew the entire way to teach and learn maths.The preface to the reader tells the terribly difficult gestation of the work in a France torn apart by civil war.Mordechai Feingold: ""The influence of Petrus Ramus : studies in the sixteenth and seventeenth century philosophy and sciences"" in ULB verfügbar und bestellt: Leider kein Bezug zur Mathematik Ramus'.Encheiridion","MK, FB",Yes,"DB, MK, FB",

The present description is based on the first of these expanded editions.After two epigrams in praise of mathematics in general and theMethodusin particular by a certain Stigelius and an Albertus respectively and a letter of dedication to Gulielmus Rhetius, prior of Saint-Michel d'Anvers, theMethodusfalls into four parts. The first one (De speciebus, fol. 3v–18r) discusses digits, numbers, the four basic arithmetical operations and the rule of three. Part two (De fractionibus sive minutiis, fol. 18r–24r) is dedicated to fractions. Part three (De regulis vulgaribus, fol. 24r–52v) deals with many word problems, some of which involve the rule of three, and with the extraction of square and cubic roots. Moreover, the so-calledregula falsi(""rule of wrong"", i.e. the method of double false position) is introduced (fol. 32r–37v), a method of solving equations by guessing two solutions, putting them to the test and using the results to calculate the real solution (in the case of linear equations) or a better approximation (in other cases), a procedure which can be repeated as often as necessary.  The author takes great pride in this method, which he seems to regard as his personal invention. However, this is definitely not the case. The method was known by Arabic mathematicians andLeonardo da Pisawho had presented it by the name ofregula ecataym(a latinization of the Arabic ""al-khaṭāʾayn"") to the western world in hisLiber abacialready in the 13th century. During the 15th and 16th century theregula falsiwas in fact a standard method in various popular math textbooks (e.g. in the mid-15th-centuryAlgorismus ratisbonensisor Adam Ries's famousRechenbuch). The last part (fol. 52v–58v) treats proportions.The quadripartite structure and the contents show a remarkable similarity to Johannes Huswirt'sEnchiridion novus algorismi, which the present work also resembles in its language, mathematical notation, way of addressing the reader and recipe style. There seems to have been a whole class of such books which can be seen as Latin equivalents to the vernacularRechenbücher(on which seeGärtner 2000).The original work is followed by Peletier's additions: a short letter to the reader (fol. 59r), a series of comments on and explanations of specific passages (fol. 59v–64v), an introduction to ""astronomic fractions"" (i.e. the sexagesimal system of grades, minutes, seconds etc.) together with some instruction how to deal with them (fol. 65r–73v), and some guidelines for calendrical calculations (fol. 74r–77v). At the very end, one finds three versions in Greek and Latin verse of a widespread word problem, in which a donkey and a mule discuss the weight of their respective loads.The clear language, the short and precise explanations and the wealth of problems and examples with which they are illustrated make the work's success easy to understand. One of its most interesting aspects  is the fact that it is rather conceived as a textbook for autodidacts than for the classroom. Frisius' dedication compares hisMethodusto the textbooks used by him in his mathematics classes, which are often hard to understand, too short, or too prolix, but gives no hint that he would have substituted these inadequate textbooks with his own. Peletier explains in his address to the reader (fol. 59r) that he only pays back a debt of gratitude with his corrections and additions, since he has learned mathematics from theMethodushimself:Immo sic statuo, auctorem ipsum suo quodam iure id a me postulare, qui eius librum pro praeceptore habuerim.

Nonetheless, as already its proud title (which obviously alludes to Newton'sPrincipia) suggests, it is not only one of the last, but also one of the most important mathematical books ever written in Latin. Building on the work of predecessors and contemporaries such as Richard Dedekind and Gottlob Frege, Peano works out the first class logic sensu stricto and achieves an axiomatization of arithmetics (well-known as ""the Peano axioms of natural numbers"") that has been broadly accepted in the mathematical community. Apart from a new foundation of natural, rational and real numbers, he invents a new logical symbolistic language. Although he was not able to establish this language in mathematics, certain symbols like ""∈"" have become familiar to every schoolchild today.After a short preface, which outlines the book's purpose, and a list of the logical and arithmetical symbols used, the treatise falls into two parts, titledLogicae Notationes(""Logical notations"") andArithmeticae principiaand paginated in Roman and Arabic numerals respectively. The first part, which is subservient to the second one, describes in detail Peano's symbolic notation and gives simple examples of how it is used. In the second part, the ""Arithmetices principia"" proper, the logical substructure of the basic notions and operations of arithmetic are laid open. In ten paragraphs, the notions of number, addition, subtraction, maxima and minima, multiplication, powers, division, rational and irrational numbers and set theory are treated. Each paragraph is subdivided – in a manner faintly reminiscent of Euclid'sElements– intoExplicationes,DefinitionesandTheoremata. In order to emphasize the consistency of his theory with previously known results, Peano indicates them next to the respective theorems (e.g. p. 12, where one can find some of Euclid's classical theorems in Peano's new shape). Whereas the first part of the book consists mainly of Latin text interspersed with symbols, only a handful of titles and introductory phrases are left in normal language in the second part. All other statements are written in Peano's stricty formulaic language of mathematical logic such as, for example, ""a,b∈N.⊃.a+b∈N"" (p. 3, no. 19).Arithmetices principiacan be seen as an attempt to formalize the theory of numbers. Like other 19th-century mathematicians (e.g. Dedekind or Cantor) Peano had noticed the flaws in the theory of calculus which boiled down to an unprecise number concept. Although this work is pioneering the foundationist streams starting in the 1890s (e.g. Russell or Hilbert), Peano's main goal was just to present arithmetics in a clear and rigorous way.That Peano wrote his treatise in Latin at this late date can be understood as a logical result of his personal convictions and interests. Not only did he write and speak the language fluently, he also thought Latin to be an indispensable tool to overcome the linguistic Babel science had become towards the end of the 19th century. (In 1903, he therefore invented a simplified Latin, Latino sine flexione, one of the most successful artificial languages ever, and used it in many mathematical publications.) InArithmetices principia, the universality and precision of Latin is the natural language counterpart, so to speak, of Peano's univocal formalism. In this context, one should also note that nobody seems to have been in need of a vernacular translation, although the treatise was an immediate success and became very influential. The first translation into English appeared only in 1967.","Heijenoort 1967, 83–97Segre 1994Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 524–525","Peano, Giuseppe‎(← links)","Peano, Giuseppe:Arithmetices principia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Arithmetices_principia(last revision: 18.12.2021).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

As is evident from an inscription at the end of the volume, the first book was finished on 18 April 1557, the second, on 24 July 1557. Presumably, the work was sent to Venice and printed after the author’s death in 1575.  As the printer states himself, publishing the work was a difficult task, cf. e.g. p. 29:Hic multa desunt, quae non sunt in exemplari manuscripto.The first book deals not only with integers, square and cubic numbers, but also with many other kinds of figurate numbers, for instance, triangular, pentangular, hexangular, and several pyramidal ones. The second book provides arithmetic and algebraic solutions to problems that had so far been treated from a geometrical perspective in the Euclidean tradition. He goes far beyond ancient Greek number theory and uses methods like triangular number arrays and tables and gives even a first glance at a later widely used proving technique, called induction (cf.Felgner 2012).The bulk of the work is structured by some hundredpropositionesstated in italics and subsequently proved. Sometimes the ""proof"" only consists of showing a general algorithm with the help of an example but mostly the proofs are carried out in full generality. Besides, there areprolegomena,diffinitiones,corollaria,scholiaand charts. Apparently, Maurolico imitates and adapts the structure of Euclid’sElementswhich he had himself edited at an earlier date. Many numerical and geometrical illustrations regarding what is said in the main text (being itself entirely free of mathematical formulas, which is still quite common during that era) are placed in marginal notes.In this book Maurolico picks up an ancient scientific topic which were the center of interest among Pythagoreans and had found its way into Euclid'sElements. But generalising the idea of figurated numbers to five and six-sided polytopes or even using a third dimension proved to be a fruitful and broadly adopted idea among subsequent mathematicians likeFermator Pascal.",Felgner 2012,"Maurolico, Francesco‎(← links)Opuscula mathematica‎(← links)","Maurolico, Francesco:Arithmeticorum libri II, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Arithmeticorum_libri_II(last revision: 25.01.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

In a briefprohemium(""introduction"", fol. av), the author, who presents himself as a doctor of arts and medicine, explains that he has written the work in order to save physicians from harm they may suffer because of the ignorance of pharmacists (aromatariorum ignorantiam): all pharmacists should undergo an exam based on the present book. (The background of these ambitious aspirations remains unclear.) Moreover, Saladinus dedicates the work to an unnamed pharmacist, apparently a friend of his, who is also his colleague in the service of Del Balzo Orsini.The work comprises some 60 pages and falls into sevenparticulae(small parts), as indicated by adivisio libri(""arrangement of the book"") that follows immediately after theprohemium. Part 1 is a kind of pharmaceutical catechism comprising a series of questions and answers introduced bydico quod(""I say that …""; fol. ar–b2v). (Catechism-like passages also appear in the remaining parts, a feature that clearly is linked in some way to the claims made in the introduction.) Part 2 contains an alphabetical lexicon of technical terms to be found in theAntidotarium Nicolai, a 12th century pharmacopoeia (b2v–b5r). The terms are partly explained, partly etymologized. Part 3 provides an overview of pharmaceutical weights and measures (fol. b4v–b6r). In part 4, the preparation of various kinds of drugs is explained (fol. b6r–v). Part 5 gives prescriptions when and how to collect herbs, flowers, seeds and roots (fol. b6v–c2v). The preservation of drugs is the subject of part 6 (fol. c2v–er). Finally, Saladinus lists the stock of an exemplary pharmacy (fol. er–e5v; cf. the much laterPharmacopoea Austriaco-Provincialis emendata).The work does not claim to present any novel contents. Instead, it heavily and explicitly relies on medieval Latin and eastern sources such as Mesue, Serapion the younger and the above-mentionedAntidotarium Nicolai. Its merit lies in the neat presentation of many important aspects of the pharmacist's craft in a nutshell. The author writes a technical Latin that is untouched by any humanist pretensions in its orthography, lexicon, word use, constructions and moods, as shown by the following example (fol. c3r):Si ergo queratur quanto tempore durat aloes, dico quod potest servari usque ad X annos.(""So if it is asked for how much time aloe remains fresh, I say that it can be preserved up to ten years."") This sentence also illustrates another stylistic characteristic, namely Saladinus' strong, authoritative presence in his text.The earlyeditio princepsof theCompendiumshows that it must have been successful in manuscript, and this success was to be continued in print.

Accedit Tractatus de seriebus infinitis et epistola Gallice scripta De ludo pilae reticularis",,1713,Basel,Frères de Tournes,18th century,"Monograph, Commentary, Other (see description)",Mathematics,"Ars coniectandi(e-rara.ch)Alternative link:archive.org,Google Books",807388,"ThisArt of Guessing(on the title and the practical usefulness it implies, see p. 213), which can be called Bernoulli'sopus magnum, was published only in 1713, eight years after the author's death, by his nephew, Niclaus Bernoulli. Based on the works of Bernoulli's predecessors, mainlyHuygens,Cardano,Fermatand Pascal, it realised decisive progress in the young mathematical subdisciplines of probability theory and combinatorics. The name alludes to theArs cogitandi, a successful book on logic, presumably by Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, of which theArs coniectandiwas supposed to form an extension.Structure and content.Structurally, theArs coniectandiis a quite complex book. The editor gives a sketch of its structure in his preface to the reader. The body text is divided into four parts.Part I is in fact a reprint ofHuygens'sDe ratiociniis in ludo aleae(1657) with a commentary by Bernoulli, which is why the text is divided intopropositionesandannotationes. In these annotations (which comprise about four times the original material), Bernoulli generalises many results and extends Huygens's central concept of ""expectation"" also to non-positive values. He establishes the relation of what later would be called Bernoulli distribution and binomial distribution.Part II develops the fundamentals of combinatorics based on works ofvan Schooten,Leibniz,Wallis, Prestet, Faulhaber, Remmelin andMercatorwhich Bernoulli all mentions by name. Blaise Pascal, however, is curiously not appearing in this list despite the prominent appearance of his famous triangle of binomial coefficents. It seems that Bernoulli had no knowledge of Pascal's results because he repeats and proves them in a clompletely different arrangement and with a priority claim. Apart from that, one can find all basic combinatorial problems and notions like permutations, combinations, bi- and multinomial coefficents, figurate numbers and their relations. Furthermore, a formula for sums of powers of integers by means of a certain polynomial is presented; its coefficients would be later called ""Bernoulli numbers"".In part III, the results of the preceding parts are applied to 24 games of chance using also the tool of conditional expectation.Part IV, which was planned to provide applications to social, legal and financial matters, remained incomplete at Bernoulli's death in 1705, but is nonetheless important and probably the most original part: It introduces the concept of ""probability"" in a wider context than only for games of chance. With three illustrating examples (throw of a die, weather forecast and forecast of a planetary eclipse), Bernoulli claims that, for theological reasons, chance does not exist, only lack of knowledge. In these situations, probability can be used as a measure for a degree of certainty. He proposes that the values for such a probability can be obtained bya prioriinvestigations (by combinatorics, if possible) or bya posterioriinvestigations (by executing a large amount of independent identical experiments if possible). For other situations in social or legal matters, the method of obtaining numerical values for a degree of certainty remains vague. Nevertheless, Bernoulli offers several concepts of probability which constitute the main lines of interpretation up to now. His notion of ""moral certainty"", when an event is 99% or 99,9% certain, is of utmost importance in modern mathematical statistics (albeit not by this name).
Finally, part IV comes with the first limit theorem in the history of probability theory: a first version of the law of large numbers (pp. 228–239, esp. 236), which Bernoulli callstheorema aureaand which he proves rigorously with the aid of several technical lemmas. This version is today known as ""weak law of large numbers"" and is definitly the culmination of Bernoulli's book on probability theory.Internally, part II is structured bycapitaandregulae, part III byproblemata, part IV bycapitaagain. Appended to theArs coniectandiproper, one finds two shorter works: a treatise dedicated to sums of infinite series and their use in rectification and squaring problems, and a French letter on the jeu de paume (the predecessor of modern tennis), which is discussed from the point of view of winning chances.Language and style.For the better part, theArs coniectandistill consists of 'normal' text despite its high level of technicality. Mathematical formulas and equations are of course used, but they are still dependent on the text, that is, syntactically integrated into it. Charts and tables also occur, but they are not overly frequent. The style is impersonal, the syntax clear. The technical terminology mirrors the work's scientific level and makes it a difficult read for the uninitiated. Consider, for instance, the following sentence from part II (p. 108), which refers to an accompanying chart:Et apparebit primo intuitu progressiones has duplas ordine continuari per denominatores fractionum in columnis, adeo ut denominator areolae n columnae cuiuslibet m sit terminus m+n progressionis duplae ab unitate, i.e. potestas binarii, cuius exponens m+n+1 …(""And it will become apparent at one glance that this double sequence proceeds in an orderly manner with regard to the denominators of the fractions in the columns: The denominator in fieldnof each columnmis the term m+n of the duplicating sequence starting from 1, that is, the power of 2 with the exponentm+n+1 …""). Even in less technical parts, where Bernoulli grounds his work philosophically and theologically, he is unafraid of quite exotic and scholastic-looking terms such asfuturitio(p. 210), which he has possibly coined himself. He states that the termexpectatio(""expectation"") must not be understood literally but is rather a technical expression. That a world-class mathematician still could be a good Latin poet around 1700 is shown by the beautiful epigram that concludes the treatise on infinite series (p. 306):Ut non-finitam seriem finita coercet / summula et in nullo limite limes adest, / sic modico immensi vestigia Numinis haerent / corpore et angusto limite limes abest. / Cernere in immenso parvum, dic, quanta voluptas, / in parvo immensum cernere quanta Deum!ImpactTheArs coniectandiwas almost immediately recognised as a seminal work. In the fields of probability theory, combinatorics and even number theory, it exerted a profound and lasting influence. Although many results had been already published by other authors, Bernoulli's clear and comprehensive account became soon very popular.A recent English translation and a reprint of a late 19th century German translation testify to its esteem even in the 21th century.","Bernoulli 2002Bernoulli 2005Grattan-Guinness 2005, 88–104Hald 1990, esp. ch. 15, 220–256","Bernoulli, Jakob‎(← links)De ratiociniis in ludo aleae‎(← links)","Bernoulli, Jakob:Ars coniectandi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ars_coniectandi(last revision: 20.02.2022).","""For the better part, theArs coniectandistill consists of 'normal' text despite its high level of technicality.

"Cardano, Girolamo",Artis magnae sive de regulis algebraicis liber unus,,1545,Nuremberg,Petreius,16th century,"Monograph, Other (see description)",Mathematics,Ars magna(MDZ),660344,"In 1545 Cardano published his groundbreaking book on algebra, theArs magna– and this is not only the name of the book but also its content: Algebra was considered a “great art”. TheArs magnais most famously known for the first printed version of the general solution of cubic equations, also known as Cardano’s rule. If the rule can be attributed to Cardano himself can be doubted, and in fact many stories circulate on the genesis of the formula involving the leading Italian Renaissance mathematicians Scipione del Ferro and Niccoló Tartaglia. Cardano himself mentions the role of these mathematicians in this discovery. But even if the rule was not originally by Cardano, he at least was the first one being able to solve all types of cubic equations and certainly the first one who made the method publicly available by means of theArs magna.Contents1Paratexts2The first chapters3The solution of the cubic equation4An approximation method5Further algebraic novelties6Language7ConclusionParatextsThe titlepage consists of the book title, a portrait of Cardano surrounded by a verse of Euripides’ drama ""Helen"" saying ἐς τὸ φέρτερον τίθει τὸ μέλλον, ὅ τι γενήσεται (“Take a brighter view of the future, whatever will happen”). On the bottom part of the titlepage, there is already a letter to the reader praising the new discoveries of the author that leave all predecessors insignificant. This is followed by a dedication letter to Andreas Osiander on the second page and a table of contents listing the forty chapters of the book.The book closes with the somewhat mysterious colophonQuinquies exscriptus, maneat tot millibus annis(""Written five times, it shall last for as many thousand years."") followed by the name of the author Cardano, the printer Petreius, place (Nuremberg) and year.This may seem pretentious, but theArs magnacontains many novelties, indeed, most prominently Cardano’s rule for (reduced) cubic equations.The first chaptersThe first chapters deal with general considerations about equations and their solutions. In chapter one, Cardano talks about real, that is, positive solutions (aequationes verae) and negative solutions (aequationes fictae) of equations. Cardano states that if one finds a fictitious solution of a cubic equation, its positive counterpart is a true solution of a similar equation where just one term has changed sides. He accepts negative numbers mostly as a useful tool for the systematic study of algebraic equations. Then, he distinguishes as many as 44 cases (capitula) of algebraic equations. All these different cases arise if one allows only positive coefficients for the algebraic equations.For example, in chapter V Cardano presents the three forms of general quadratic equations and their solution by the following jingle (carmen):Querna, da bisNuquer, ad miRequan, minue damiIn the first lineQuernarepresents x²=ax+b (quadratum aequale rebus et numero), in the secondNuqueris b+x²=ax (numerum quadrato ac rebus aequalem) andRequanmeans ax+x²=b (res quadrato et numero aequales). The parameters a and b are assumed positive numbers. The second halves of the lines give hints how to set the signs in the solution formula (add twice, add and subtract, …) which is formulated verbally. The chapter first rolls out the deduction of the rules for the three cases by means of geometric algebra in the Arabic tradition; then the rules and ten completely solved examples follow.Chapter VI contains sophisticated decompositions of the cube in several solids which are key observations for both reducing general cubic equations and solving reduced cubic equations.The solution of the cubic equationThe chapters XI to XIII contain the celebrated formulas for solving the cubic equations. The ideas are similar and boil down to a “completion of the cube” as done in the above-mentioned chapter VI. In the beginning of chapter XI (on the equation x³+ax=b), Cardano states again that he is indebted to Scipione del Ferro and Niccoló Tartaglia who where able to find the rules in order to solve the equations. But, he adds, he was able to prove them geometrically and deduce the other cases by himself. Onfol. 30rthe rule, later known as “Cardano’s rule”, is presented and executed on three examples. Chapter XII treats the equation x³=ax+b, and chapter XIII x³+b=ax (always with positive numbers a,b).The chapters XIV to XXIII are dedicated to cubic equations containing quadratic terms. Using again chapter VI, Cardano removes the quadratic terms and solves the resulting reduced equation by the previously introduced methods (modernly speaking, he does a substitution y=x+a/3, when a is the coefficient of the quadratic term).The solution of the quartic equation is attributed to Ludovico Ferrari and is artfully translated in a problem of solving a cubic equation in chapter XXXIX.An approximation methodIn chapter XXX of the book, Cardano uses a method of iterative linear interpolation of a polynomial to find approximative solutions. The method which Cardano callsregula aurea(the “Golden Rule”) is mathematically equivalent to theregula falsi(double false position), but looks completely different and is applied here in a different situation. Whereas theregula falsiwas a scheme used to solve linear word problems exactly, the purpose of theregula aureawas to approximate solutions of algebraic equations iteratively.Further algebraic noveltiesInchapter XXXVII,De regula falsum ponendiCardano treats roots of negative numbers and cautiously explores how to manipulate them. This is not only a game because in a later edition of 1570 he added a chapter calledDe aliza regula(the meaning ofalizais debated, probably it means difficult,Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol. 3, 65) treating the so-called ""irreducible case"" when there are three real solutions for a cubic equation. Using the rules how to manipulate roots of negative numbers, one could obtain real solutions. This surprising discovery ultimately lead to the acceptance of complex numbers during the following centuries.LanguageThe book is full of technical algebraic terms likeresorpositio(the unknown),quadratum(the square),cubus(the cube),denominatio(powers of the unknown) and practical abbreviations like p: (plus), m: (minus), ℞ (radix, the root),q͞d(for quadratum) and many more. This half-abbreviated, half-symbolic way of denoting equations is called syncopated algebra. The latin is rather simple and formalistic.ConclusionTheArs magnais among the most influential books of algebra. Not only does it present for the first time in history the long-awaited solution of the cubic (and even quartic) equation, but also considers many matters of interest: The connection of roots and coefficients, an idea picked up byVieta, the start of asystematic study of algebraic equations, the appearance of negative and even imaginary and complex numbers - all these issues proved to be fertile ground for the further development of algebra. TheArs magnastands for the first major occidental contribution to the field.This was seen by contemporaries as well and the work was reprinted in 1570 and 1633.","Cardano; Witmer 2007(English translation and commentary)Cantor 1880–1908, vol. 2, 484–513.Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 3, 64–67.Herrmann 2016, 324–328.","De occulta parte numerorum‎(← links)Cardano, Girolamo‎(← links)Arithmetica integra‎(← links)","Cardano, Girolamo:Ars magna, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ars_magna(last revision: 27.06.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,

Exploring the tensions between the ancient language and the modern topics, Neo-Latin poets wrote on electricity, photography, trains, bikes or Zeppelins. Many, but not all of these pieces were submissions to theCertamen Hoeufftianum(1844–1978), a prestigious contest for Neo-Latin poetry (cf.Wiegand 1984, 39–42).Pope Leo XIII (Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci) wrote Neo-Latin poetry throughout his life, especially hymns, occasional and didactic poems (cf.Giustiniani 1979, 55–57). His poems were published in a printed edition with an Italian translation in 1883 (with supplements in 1898 and 1902) and in a printed edition with anEnglish translationin 1902. Another edition of the pope's Latin poems was produced in Cologne in 1903 (a German translation followed the next year).Pecci composed his panegyric poem on photography in 1867 (before he became pope), when the new technology was just a few decades old. Consisting of two stanzas of four iambic dimetres, it expresses wonder over a portrait photograph:Expressa solis spiculonitens imago, quam benefrontis decus, vim luminumrefers et oris gratiam!O mira virtus ingeninovumque monstrum! Imaginemnaturae Apelles aemulusnon pulchriorem pingeret.""O shining image, depicted by a sunbeam, how well do you display the beauty of the forehead, the power of the eyes and the grace of the mouth! O wonderful virtue of talent, o new marvel! Apelles, the rival of nature, would not paint a more beautiful image!""This poem is composed as a hymn of two Ambrosian strophes, drawing on a classical form of Christian poetry. While the titleArs photographicaexhibits the technical term for the new technology, the poem itself consists only of classical vocabulary. Throughout the hymn, photography is cloaked in ancient language, metres, rhetorical figures and points of reference. At the beginning of the first stanza, the photograph (imago) is addressed and therefore elevated as the object of the hymn. The enumeration of the single features of the face (a tricolon with two chiasms) highlights the poet's fascination with the portrait and seems to correspond to the detail and accuracy of the photograph. In the second stanza, the wonder of photography is emphasised in another exclamation.

As the disease flared up again in 1585, Crato, although of failing health, published athird, revised editionof the plague ordinance. In parallel or in close succession to this publishing effort, Crato wrote theAffirmationas a supplement in Latin, which was printed in the same year. The short text of 51 pages takes the form of a letter. The letter is addressed to Crato's son, but the text suggests that it was intended to be read by a wider circle of medical experts (see the quote from p. 10 below). The valediction dates the letter to August 1585, two months before Crato's death.Crato's principle aim is to justify his distinction between two types of pestilent fever, a non-contagiouus and a contagious type, a division that had attracted criticism for contradicting the opinion of ancient and recent medical writers. In the course of the text, Crato deals with the corruption of food and air, contagion and putrefaction, the non-contagious and the contagious type of pestilent fever (which he callsprivataandpublica, respectively) as well as the signs, cures and the prevention of the disease. Headings in the margins of the print point to the beginning of a new section.In the introduction and closing of the letter, Crato ascribes the criticism of his ideas in part to the lexical problems of publishing in German, to which he had resorted in order to communicate with the people in the face of an epidemic. In particular, Crato accuses the ""poverty of the German language"" (egestas Teutonici sermonis,p. 9) and the limits of intercomprehension between different German dialects (Fateor me in Teutonico libello multis vocabulis corruptis et in media Germania parum cognitis usum esse,p. 55). (The latter still posed a problem for the Swiss authorJohann Jakob Scheuchzerin hisPhysica sacrasome 150 years later).In order to remove these language-related problems from the equation, Crato chooses Latin, the standard language of medical discourse, when responding to the criticism raised against him:Latinoscripto ab errore eos abducere et bonis de meo libro incommodius sentientibus [...] rationes saltem probabiles reddere atque intimum quasi animi mei sensum de pestilentibus morbis ostendere diligenter enitar(""I will try diligently to dissuade them from their error, to answer with plausible arguments to the good men who disagree with my book and to show them the innermost thoughts of my mind, as it were, about the pestilent diseases, in aLatintext"",p. 10). When Crato states towards the end that he did not say anything new, but explained what he had said in a different and more convenient way (Nihil dictum, quod non sit dictum prius: sed dicta alias et commodius explicamus et interpretamur,p. 55), this could be a reference to the choice of language and its fully-fledged capacity for professional discourse. However, Crato also adresses the conflict between technical content and stylistic perfection: he apologizes to his son for the use of some ""barbaric"" and uncommon Latin words (p. 55–56), but explains that his explanations had to be clear rather than beautiful.The paratext contains a short letter to the reader, in which the editor (probably Peter Monau) writes that he was surprised to be sent the Latin book, while he was seeing to the print of the third edition of Crato's pest ordinance, and that he decided to publish them together, but in such a way that each could be bought independently. He also explains that the text is not perfectly polished because of the author's situation (the editor states that he made only the slightest changes to Crato's text). At the end of the volume, there is another short letter, dated 6th September 1585, which Johannes Crato wrote to Peter Monau in response to his feedback on the book.",,"Crato, Johannes‎(← links)","Crato, Johannes:Assertio pro libello suo Germanico, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Assertio_pro_libello_suo_Germanico(last revision: 01.09.2021).","start of the letter: problems of publishing on science and medicine in German (prestige, lexic problems, gatekeeping)","DB, MK",Yes,IT,

Tychonis Brahe, iussu et sumptibus Rudolphi II. Romanorum Imperatoris etc. Plurium annorum pertinaci studio elaborata Pragae, Sacrae Caesaris Maiestatis Suae mathematico Joanne Keplero.",,1609,Heidelberg,Voegelin,17th century,"Monograph, Other (see description), Encyclopedic work",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Astronomia nova(e-rara.ch),807626,"Johannes Kepler’sAstronomia novais in many respects one of the groundbreaking scientific works of the 17th century. With the help ofTycho Brahe’shigh-quality observations (especially of the planet Mars) he developed his famous laws of planetary motion and presented the first two in this book. Incorporating revolutionary ideas of physical causes for celestial motions on the one hand, and basing his arguments on the very precise observations available to him on the other, Kepler introduces mathematics into natural philosophy as well as natural philosophy into the considerations of astronomy. Up to the beginning of the 17th century, the latter had been considered a branch of pure mathematics.Aware of transcending the borders of traditional scientific disciplines, Kepler carefully designed the structure and rhetorics of theAstronomia novato meet the expectations of both astronomers and natural philosophers, and to prevent their numerous potential objections.Structure and Content.In the dedication letter to emperor Rudolph II, Kepler declares the long-awaited capture of the fugitive Mars, which he, Kepler, with tremendous effort, had now managed for the glory of the house of Hapsburg. This alludes to the planet’s inexplicable deviations from its positions according to the previous models. This is followed by three epigrams (one by Kepler himself, a second one bySaxirupiusand one by Janus Seuss). Next come Tycho Brahe’s “Hortatory Ode” (a call to younger generations to participate in the reformation of astronomy) and Kepler’s own response to it, where he praises Tycho’s accomplishments – and, of course, his own in the various results in the work. The following elegy by Kepler alludes to the disagreements between the two astronomers and to the conservative nature of Tycho’s world view. This section of the work is closed by another epigram by Kepler and a short passage by Tycho’s heir Tengnagel.The rather long preface starts with Kepler’s apparently most pressing concern: “It is extremely hard these days to write mathematical books, especially astronomical ones” (transl.Voelkel 2001, p. 223). Lacking a clear audience, he then explains the results, methods and structure of the book explicitly addressing both natural philosophers and astronomers. He refers to different parts of the books which should be of special interest to only one of the two groups and promises a clear distinction between natural philosophical and astronomical arguments. The curious tabula synoptica marks all dead-ends of previous astronomical theories, before the end of the prefatory section presents abstracts for every chapter.The rest of the book – its main body – falls into five parts: Part I is dedicated to the theories of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe. Kepler calculates and answers various questions in all three systems showing their computational equivalence. He also incorporates some personal improvements in all systems showing that they yield better results: He introduces, for example, the real sun as a reference and not the mean sun which had been astronomical practice since Ptolemy.Part II treats the motion of the planets based on the “vicarious hypothesis”, a useful hypothesis which resulted in good predictions for planetary positions but was also proven to be wrong.In part III Kepler computes the motion of the Earth (resp. the sun in Ptolemy’s and Tycho’s systems). He discovers that the distances of the Earth to the real sun may vary along with the speed of the planet on its orbit. This was a revolutionary idea which is  precisely formulated in what is now known as Kepler’s second law (the area law).In part IV the shape of the orbit of planet Mars is put under the microscope. After showing several failed attempts (circular and oval shapes) which all rely on tedious calculations, the ellipse is presented as the most suitable orbit and thus Kepler’s first law formulated. The calculations involved are an early contribution in the development of calculus.Part V deals with Mars’ changes of latitude, mostly to conclude again that the real sun should be taken as reference for planetary motions. Furthermore, Kepler describes the physical force (vis) exercised by the allegedly spinning sun on the planets. Such a force is assumed to have a stronger effect on nearby planets and a weaker one on those further away in being described as a kind of “magnetic” force. In this regard, Kepler was certainly fascinated by the recent discovery of the Earth’s magnetic field byWilliam Gilbertdescribed inDe magnete.Rhetoric.Voelkel 2001credits Kepler with great rhetorical skill in his awareness of the difficulties his work might encounter in its potential readership(s). He chooses a “pseudo-historical narration” as his style of presentation (cf.Thorvaldsen 2010, 41). He depicts himself on a quest for the truth, and includes all the possible dead-ends encountered on using the classical astronomical theories. The reader is lead to the impression that Kepler’s approach is completely open, based on unquestionable observations, to the extent that he was forcibly driven to his conclusions.Kepler uses his knowledge of classical rhetoric. He reveals his ethos in appealing to his long labour and uses pathos to arouse emotions and even “entertain” the audience: He involves his readers in his frustrations in order that they acknowledge and even share his final triumph (cf.Voelkel 2001, 214–216).Apart from this style of narration he takes great care in leading natural philosophers to the parts which they can comprehend and acknowledge, encouraging them to jump pages full of calculation which he carried out for astronomers and for completeness of his argument. On the other hand, he supports all arguments with careful astronomical – thus mathematical – considerations and all results are based on sure mathematical foundations lead by observation. His method of considering all possible objections (many of which he got from a correspondence with his friend and astronomer David Fabricius) and of proving them wrong is an active anticipation of reader’s probable responses.Kepler was not only preoccupied with objections against his heliocentrism and his physical astronomy, but even more with Tycho’s heirs and disciples, especially Tycho's son-in-law Tengnagel and the astronomer Longomontanus. By defending the Tychonian system and reminding Kepler of his duties towards his former master, they were able to interfere in the publication process of theAstronomia nova. Kepler’s defence against the proponents of the Tychonian model and the struggle with Tycho’s legacy is a main thread in the presentation of theAstronomia nova.TheAstronomia novais one of the scientific key publications in the early modern period. It paved the way forNewton’sfamousPrincipia mathematica, and introduced physical reasoning into astronomy, mathematics into natural philosophy. Despite – or even because of – its revolutionary character, theAstronomia novadid not sell well among contemporaries and it took until the second half of the 17th century for Kepler’s theses to be commonly accepted.","Voelkel 2001,Thorvaldsen 2010","Tabulae Rudolphinae‎(← links)Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)Systema cosmicum‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Dissertatio cum nuntio sidereo‎(← links)Mysterium cosmographicum‎(← links)Tabulae astronomicae Ludovici magni iussu et munificentia exaratae‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes:Astronomia nova, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Astronomia_nova(last revision: 12.03.2022).",,"DB, MK, JL, IT, FB",Yes,"DB, FB",

On its first pages, the book features the imprimatur, a dedication to Prince George of Denmark, the husband of Queen Anne, and a preface to the reader, in which Gregory states that the aim of his book is to provide ""a little easier"" access toKepler'sand Newton's celestial mechanics. The new physical aspects of astronomy, he says, are explained with the help of geometrical tools, but without recourse toastronomia arithmetica sive calculatoria, that is, to Newton's version of the calculus. The reader is further encouraged by the assertion that celestial physics is much easier to grasp than terrestrial because the respective bodies are subject to fewer influences. Finally, Gregory argues in a superbly anachronistic tour de force that already the ancient Greek philosophers were familiar with Newton's insights, in particular, the inverse-square law for gravitation. The book concludes with a table of contents and a short list of errata.The account itself comprises c. 500 quarto pages and falls into six books. Book 1 discusses the Newtonian world system, book 2, the fixed stars, book 3, the planets, book 4, the moons, containing aLatin translationof Newton's treatise on the theory of the Moon's motion which is marked by single quotation marks in every respective line. Book 5 is dedicated to the comets and the last book is an ingenious exercise calledastronomia comparativa: Gregory tries to deepen the reader's understanding by showing how the solar system would look like if seen from the sun, another planet, a moon, or a comet. The single books are subdivided intosectiones, each of which falls into a number ofpropositionesin turn. Thepropositionesmay be accompanied byscholiaorcorollaria. Some of them are specified to belemmata, that is, auxiliary statements. Most, however, present problems formulated in infinitive phrases in their titles, such asLongitudinem axis maioris orbitae cuiusvis planetae primarii invenire(b. 3, prop. 24, p. 235: ""To find the length of the major axis of any planet""). The argument is illustrated by numerous diagrams, which are indispensable for the understanding of Gregory's geometrical proofs. On pp. 13–14, for example, it is demonstrated in this way that a body describing a curve whose connection line to a given point moves over equal areas in equal periods of time presupposes a centripetal force attracting it to that point, a result by Newton in hisPrincipia mathematica.The argument proceeds steadily and coherently. Summaries remind the reader of what he has already learned, as for instance at the beginning of book 2 (p. 113), where the contents of the preceding book are recapitulated. Gregory's Latin is perfectly classical apart from the necessary technical terminology. Even in the latter field, the author is happy to invest a classical term with a technical meaning – on p. 13,subsultim(""by skipping"") is given the sense ""in small steps"" – or to invent a neologism on the basis of classical word material: on p. 235, he createsratio subsesquiplicatain the meaning ""the third root of the square"" on the basis ofsesquiplex(""one and a half times""). Such formations notwithstanding, the Latin usually is of exemplary clarity, which enables Gregory to dispense with mathematical notation over large stretches of his account. For instance, the solution (based on Kepler's second law) of the problem quoted above is formulated as follows:Ac primum quomodo illarum axes maiores definiantur ostendemus. Capiendus est orbitae cuiusvis planetae primarii axis maior ad axem maiorem orbitae terrae in subsesquiplicata ratione periodici temporis propositi planetae (per propositionem praecedentem inventi) ad tempus periodicum telluris circa solem per propositionem XIII determinatum. Sic enim fient cubi maiorum axium orbitarum planetae et terrae ut quadrata temporum periodicorum corporum istorum circa solem …And let us begin by showing how the major axes of the orbits can be ascertained. The major axis of any given planet's orbit must be taken to relate to the major axis of the earth's orbit as the third root of the square of the ratio of the respective planet's circulation period (which has been found in the preceding proposition) to the circulation period of the earth around the sun, determined in proposition XIII. For in this way, the third powers of the major axes of the planet's and the earth's orbits will obtain the same ratio as the squares of these bodies' circulation periods around the sun …Still, Gregory's work apparently proved too demanding to become a textbook for students. At least, that is what his pupil and successorJohn Keillsays in the preface to his own, simpler textbook, theIntroductio ad veram astronomiam seu lectiones astronomicae. Nonetheless, there must have been readers who found thePhilosophiae naturalis principia mathematicatoo difficult and Keill's work too much of a simplification, as theAstronomiae physicae et geometricae elementaproved reasonably successful - but rather as a handbook than a textbook.

It comprises thirty tables, arranged in five series of six tables each, which are dedicated to the head, the upper and lower torso, the arms, and the legs respectively. Each table features two, three, or four engravings, resulting in series of twelve to twenty images. One tissue layer after the other is removed and deeper layers are gradually revealed, following the procedure of a dissection in a manner which can already be observed in Vesalius'De humani corporis fabrica. Each engraving has a subscription indicating in standardized terms which layer has been removed and/or what is to be seen. The first image on table I, for instance, is captionedStratum I cute cum nervis cutaneis remota apparens(""Layer I, which appears when the skin with its nerves has been removed""). The different anatomical structures are marked with small figures and letters, which correspond to a key at the bottom of the page. There, the structures are classified asossa(""bones""),cartilagines(""cartilages""),musculi(""muscles""),glandulae(""glands""), and so on, and indicated with their scientific Latin designations.The only piece of running text is the concise preface signed by Froriep. (In the present copy, an even shorter preface to the second, unchanged edition has been added, in which Froriep congratulates himself on the success of the first edition, of which no copy is available online at the moment.) The original preface describes the work's structure and the collaboration between anatomist and engraver and explains the envisaged use of the book, relating it to the latter's format: theAtlasshall be placed on the anatomical table during a dissection so that the students can always compare what they are seeing in the body with the engravings and the key. Therefore, a comparatively small format, quarto, has been chosen (as well as, which is not mentioned, a horizontal format). The preface is written in correct, but somewhat cumbersome Latin, as its final sentence may demonstrate:Equidem mihi, cum cursum vitae institutum ita mutare coactus fuerim, ut professoris academici muneri renuntiarem, perquam gratum fuerit, si hoc Atlante, qui ad partem studiorum medicorum gravissimam pertinet recte discendam, id demonstrasse iudicabor, me quod ad artem faciendam attinet recte quid professorem medicinae praestare oporteret percepisse.For my part, since I have been forced to change the course of my life in such a way that I had to renounce the profession of a university professor [Froriep had become director of the ""Landes-Industrie-Comptoir"" in Weimar, the very institution which published theAtlas], it would be very pleasing to me if I will be judged to have shown with thisAtlas, which pertains to the learning of that part of medical studies which is most important, that I have grasped correctly what a professor of medicine has to provide regarding the practice of the art.As often in scholarly and scientific works of the 19th century, one gets the impression that the author is choosing intricate constructions on purpose in order to flaunt his mastery of the fine print in the latest academic grammar.TheAtlaswas quite a success.

This work was planned to consist of five parts treating the Creation, astronomy, astrology, the elements, and geography respectively (Praefatio in Atlantem, directly after the introductory paratexts to the present work). He did not live to finish this opus magnum. After Gerhard's death, his son Rumold collected itsdisiecta membra, supplemented them as best he could and edited them asAtlas or Cosmographical Reflections on the Making of the World and the Form of the World Made(a title chosen by the father, see below).The result was a massive folio volume full of splendid maps and other engravings and featuring an impressive array of introductory paratexts: a dedication in the form of an ellogium, a portrait of the author in the form of a medallion framed by an epigram, further poems of praise (and mourning) for the author and his work, Gerhard's epitaph, a biography (theVita Gerardi Mercatoris) and two letters by friends extolling his achievement. Despite this captivating outfit, however, the book is in fact a fragment. As the three inner parts have been omitted, the two remaining ones have become disconnected. The original plan has been thoroughly altered: a cosmography with a strong astronomical component has been transformed into a predominantly geographical work.Part one comprises some 30 pages and provides a kind of running commentary to the biblical account of the Creation, in which the physical and cosmological aspects of Genesis are highlighted and interpreted. Part two, which is about ten times as long, features about one hundred maps and short accompanying texts. This part is basically put together from earlier publications by Gerhard. The texts have partly been excerpted from various works by other authors. A first section treats France and Germany, a second one southeastern Europe, while a last one (titledAtlantis pars altera: geographia totius mundi, ""The other part of the Atlas: geography of the entire world"") contains maps of the earth at large, the single continents and northern Europe. The projected rest of the work, which would have comprised detailed maps and descriptions of Spain and the non-European continents, as detailed in Rumold's introductory letter to thepars altera, is missing. Most of the various parts and sections have their own title page, dedication (to the rulers of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, in whose territory the Mercators resided at Duisburg, and others), preface, and index, composed at different moments partly by Gerhard, partly by Rumold. To complicate things even further, some parts are omitted in many of the surviving copies, and the single parts may be bound in a different order.The explanations accompanying the single maps (often quoted or adapted from other authors, as already mentioned) are mostly written in a simple but lively style. In the more general parts and the paratexts, Gerhard writes a spirited and lofty Latin that suits the physicotheological spirit pervading his enterprise (see e.g. p. 3 of the first part on cosmography as a way to learn more about God's creation). He is fond of extended similes, as when he likens his opus magnum to a house and its somewhat haphazard publication to the strategy of a builder-owner who is short of money and therefore erects the most vital parts first (letter of dedication preceding the part about France and Germany).Despite or because its unfinished state and its focus on geography, theAtlasbecame hugely successful. It was reprinted, abbreviated, revised and integrated into a number of later works, serving as a starting point for the great 17th-century tradition of world atlases. Its most permanent legacy was the transformation ofAtlas, first used as a book title by Gerhard, to a generic name for works like his. Given the reputation of the mythical Atlas as an early astronomer (cf. Diodorus 3.60, 4.27),Atlaswould have been a fitting title for a cosmographical, predominantly astronomical work, as originally projected. Gerhard explicitly says so in thePraefatio in Atlantem. Because what was eventually published had for the better part become a collection of terrestrial maps,Atlasis illogically used for books of this kind to the present day.","Complete online translation from OCTAVOAverdunk; Müller-Reinhard 1914, 83–106van der Krogt 2009","Mercator, Gerhard‎(← links)Mercator, Rumold‎(← links)Vita Gerardi Mercatoris‎(← links)","Mercator, Gerhard; Mercator, Rumold:Atlas sive Cosmographicae meditationes, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Atlas_sive_Cosmographicae_meditationes(last revision: 26.09.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In 1271 hexameters, the author explains the hypothesis of the French scientist Jean Jacques d’Ortous de Mairan concerning the causes of the Aurora (Traité physique et historique de l’Aurore Boréale, 1733). Generally speaking, the phenomenon is understood as the result of a kind of solar wind, which collides with the atmosphere of the earth. The poem is similar to the ""Iris"" in subject, language, didactic techniques and intention. It is, however, both more ambitious and less unified; the latter may partly be due to the fact that the theory Noceti set out to versify was simply less plausible than the one treated in the ""Iris"".",,"Poemata didascalica‎(← links)Noceti, Carlo‎(← links)De obscuritate philosophiae ac de repertis Isaaci Newtoni‎(← links)","Noceti, Carlo:Aurora borealis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Aurora_borealis(last revision: 28.06.2021).",,,Yes,,

Its setting is Joachimsthal in the Ore Mountains in Saxony where Agricola worked as a physician. In the style of a Ciceronian dialogue, the work opens with an auctorial introduction, in which Agricola reflects upon the difficulties in matching the names inherited from Greek and Latin authors with the actual minerals and ores. The dialogue itself is, however, more lively than Ciceronian dialogues and resembles more a Platonic dialogue. There are three characters, Lorenz Wermann, a friend of Agricola, appears as the mining expert in a Latinized form of his name as “Bermannus”. He is the main speaker and shows the other two discussants around. His Latinized name, furthermore, reminds one of the German word for miner, “Bergmann”. The two other characters are physicians and humanists. Naevius is an expert for Greek and Latin texts. It is him with whom Bermannus discusses most of the time and his mere bookish knowledge is usually refuted by Bermannus. The third character is Ancon, who knew Bermannus before and introduces Naevius to Bermannus. Ancon is an expert in Arabic medicine but he does contribute comparably little to the discussion. Agricola himself does not appear as a character in the dialogue as it is said at the end of the fictitious dialogue that he is unfortunately absent at the time, in which the dialogue sets (p. 131). The main aim of the dialogue is to find and identify the ores and minerals mentioned in the ancient texts in order to make use of this knowledge for medical treatments.Agricola draws from many sources, mostly of course from ancient authorities like Pliny, Theophrastus, and Discurides, but also from Arabic authors like Avicenna and Razes. At times also medieval Latin authors like Albertus Magnus or contemporary authors are mentioned. 
The dialogue itself is accompanied by two paratexts. The first is a letter to Andreas and Christoph von Könneritz byErasmus of Rotterdamin which he praises the witty and yet learned content of the work (Nec satis possum dicere, maiore ne id voluptate fecerim an fructu; a2r), but especially theenargia(""graphic style"") with which its various topics are described. Then follows a dedicatory letter by Petrus Plateanus to Heinrich von Könneritz, in which Plateanus highlights the importance to publish one’s findings.
Appended to the dialogue is a Latin-German glossary. This glossary was created by Plateanus in the first edition, but later augmented by Agricola himself in the further editions.
The work became very popular and was reprinted seven times between the first edition of 1530 and 1657. In 1546, a second, augmented edition appeared that features some slight changes in some passagesWilsdorf 1955, 42).",Wilsdorf 1955(modern translation and commentary).Morello 1994,"Agricola, Georg‎(← links)Interpretatio Germanica vocum rei metallicae‎(← links)","Agricola, Georg:Bermannus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bermannus(last revision: 25.07.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,DB,

The letter starts from a praise of medicine whose glory manifests itself in itspolygraphia(""great literary productivity""), an assertion substantiated by lists of medical genres in the broadest sense of the word and of fields covered. The former list is a rare testimony of an early modern classification of scientific writings, although not all of the forms mentioned are readily identifiable: Schenck speaks oftabulis, lexicis, locis communibus, indicibus, aphorismis, dialogis, epistolis, quaestionibus, erotematibus, problematibus, isagogis, methodis, epitomis, diexodis, catalogis, consultationibus, responsis, contradictionibus, apologiis, paradoxis, disputationibus, depulsionibus et controversiis, to which he later adds a circumlocution of ""medical monograph"" (morbis nonnullis solis ingentia et operosa volumina dedicata). Medical writings, Schenck continues, are extant in a dozen languages, and there are translations, too. His book  lists not only prints, but also manuscripts. It is more comprehensive than anything before andinstruendis bibliothecis commodum(""convenient for stocking a library"").The preface to the reader further elaborates on the works's structure and rationale: It constitutes an alphabetical bibliography, which Schenck will supplement by a thematically structured one later. The author places himself in a tradition of medical bibliographers initiated by Conrad Gessner. Vernacular books are excluded from the present work, because Schenck will publish a respective catalogue, which he has already compiled, separately. By contrast, the holdings of Schenck's own medical library have been included in theBiblia iatrica. Finally, a second, enlarged version of the work is promised.The bibliography proper runs to 517 quarto pages and comprises several thousand works, alphabetically ordered by author or, in the case of anonymous works, by title. The single entries are usually written in full sentences and run from a few lines to eleven pages (Galen, pp. 120–31). Even lost books such as a medical work by a certain Aaron (p. 1) are enumerated. For vernacular authors and works, the reader is directed to the above-mentioned separate bibliography with a note likeIn elencho Germanico(""In the German list""). The overwhelming majority of all entries thus concern Latin books. For early modern authors, who make up the bulk of the text, only Latin works are given, while in the case of Greek and Arab writers, Latin translations are usually indicated.For reasons unknown, theBiblia iatricawere not much of a success.

Beside the thousands of reviews he wrote for theGöttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, he also ventured an important bibliographical initiative towards the end of his life. After he had returned to his native city Bern and laid down most of the offices and obligations that had taken up the better part of his life so far, Haller conceived the plan of writing a great medical bibliography, theBibliotheca medica. He did not live to complete thisopus magnum, but was able to publish the parts concerned with botany, anatomy (2 vols., 1774–1775) and chirurgy (2 vols., 1774–1777) before his death in 1777, while a fourth part came largely out posthumously (Bibliotheca medicinae practicae', 4 vols., 1776–1788)'. The first part of theBibliotheca, the botanical library, presents several tens of thousands botanical works from the beginnings of the discipline to 1771 in two hefty tomes, ten books, c. 1400 pages and 1921 §§.Vol. 1 opens with a preface to the entireBibliotheca medicawhich explains the overall plan: Living in his comparatively small hometown and without direct access to good libraries, Haller first and foremost depends on  his own library, which comprises c. 11.000 books and 10.000 smaller works. About all of these, which he has read at least in part, he possesses notes and judgements dating back as far as 1725. The rest of the works listed he has to cite second-hand. TheBibliothecais thus needs incomplete and contains errors, for instance regarding years of publication or Arab texts (Arab belongs to the few languages Haller does not read). The judgements about the works he is personally acquainted with are givensine ira et studio. Regarding the overall structure, the single parts are arranged in chronological order:Ita quae bibliotheca est, hactenus etiam historia artis est, cuius progressus et inventa per sua tempora sibi succendentia recenseantur.(""So this library is to a certain degree also a history of medicine; it traces its advancements and findings, as they have followed each other over the years."") One feels reminded of the more generalhistoriae litteriaeof the 17th and 18th centuries, which show a similar combination of the historical and the bibliographical.Within theBibliotheca botanica, the historical orientation is most evident at the very beginning, where Haller narrates the (largely conjectural) prehistory of the discipline. Later on, the work is mostly structured by authors, one author or group of authors being treated per paragraph as a rule. Authors and works follow each other in ever closer succession as the account progresses in time. That vol. 1 arrives at the times of Joseph Pitton to Tournefort (1656–1708) while the remaining less than one hundred years take up vol. 2 testifies to the tremendous upsurge of botany in early modern times. The single entries provide only minimal biographical information, if any, focussing largely on the respective author's literary production. Books read by Haller are briefly characterised in terms of content and scientific value. Their various editions and translations are routinely enumerated. Also manuscripts are taken into account. Haller knows no language boundaries but list works in a great many idioms as different as Arab, Dutch and Latin, although the latter quite naturally takes the lion's share. ""Botany"" is understood in the widest sense of the word. For example, works of 'botanical philology' (philologia plantarum, vol. 1, p. 437) which discuss questions of nomenclature as well as books on the cultural history of plants are included without further ado.At the end of vol. 2, nearly one hundred pages of addenda that have popped up after Haller had finished the manuscript and another ten pages of last-minute addenda document the author's zeal to make his work as complete as possible. They are interrupted by an index of 65 pages listing all the authors included as well as the titles of anonymous works.The style expresses Haller's ambition to provide as much information in as little space as possible. It is dense, compressed and technical even where he writes running text. Bibliographical abbreviations for titles, libraries, formats etc. abound. Often, the exposition ist reduced to the bare enumeration of titles, like in a present-day bibliography.",,"Haller, Albrecht von‎(← links)","Haller, Albrecht von:Bibliotheca botanica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bibliotheca_botanica(last revision: 23.02.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

TheBibliothecaprovides an overview of important authors and works in botany that are ordered according to a “natural system”. As Linnaeus explains in his preface (fol. *3r), theBibliothecais a more detailed version of his first chapter in theFundamenta botanica. The first edition of the latter work is also appended to the first edition of theBibliotheca botanica. Linnaeus goes on to explain in the preface that his systematisation of botanical writings should serve newcomers to the field of botany (tyrones, i.e.tirones) to get an easy overview of the many works and quickly find what they are looking for.  In following pages of the preface (fol. *3v–*6v), Linnaeus compares the history of botany – beginning with the ancient Greek authors as the seed, andfolia seminalia, “cotyledon”/“seminal leaf” up to his own time – in a nice allegory with the growth of the plant βοτανική (botaniké). In the end, there is a list of private libraries that Linnaeus used.More than 1000 works are ordered into 16 classes that are comprised in higher “taxa”. The highest taxon (phytologi, “those who speak about plants”) are subdivided into two groups,botanici, “botanists” (classes I to XII), andbotanophili, “botanical amateurs” (classes XIII to XVI). The latter are anatomists (XIII), gardeners (XIV), physiscians (XV), andanomal, a mixed category of poets, theologians, librarians, biographers (calledbiologi!), and others (miscellanei). The first group,botanici, is again subdivided intocollectors, “collectors of botanical knowledge” (classes I to IX), andmethodici, who thought systematically on plants (classes X to XII).Nomenclatores(class X) belong to the group ofmethodici.
The classes are subdivided into orders, genera, and species just like in Linnaeus’s natural system. An overview that also serves as a table of content can be found after the preface (first a bracket table of classes, then an overview on classes and orders). Every category is introduced by a short explanation or definition which authors and works are comprised in it. Then follows a list of the relevant works. As is characteristic for Linnaeus’s systematic works, the Latin texts are short and in the style of notes. As has been said, among the works presented are not only botanical worksstricto sensubut also related works that somehow deal with plants or botanists.

On a little under 300 duodecimo pages, it lists some 4000 entries, as proudly proclaimed on the title page. However, this impressive figure is reached at the price of poor or absent bibliographical description and most generous inclusiveness (a phenomenon observable in many early bibliographies). Place, year and format of a book are given but rarely. In most cases, only author and title are adduced (e.g.,Alphidius de Sigillis, p. 10). Manuscripts are cited as well, but not located. Entries may also be reduced to naked names of authors likeAmech Hebraeus(p. 10). Finally, even people who left no written works at all may be included, if they are reputed to have had chymical interests. A prominent case in point is Abel, who is inLibro gloriae mundi laudatus pro chemico(""adduced as a chymist in theBook of the Glory of the World"", p. 2). Of the titles cited, the great majority is in Latin, but there are a few Greek and vernacular ones as well. The entries are ordered alphabetically by author or (in the case of anynomous works) title. However, the alphabetization does not extend beyond the first two or three letters.  Two supplements titledAppendix(pp. 237–60) andCorollarium(pp. 261–72) contain material which came to Borel's notice belatedly after a new examination of his sources (post novam auctorum investigationem, p. 237) or per mail (nobis communicata, p. 261).The work was dedicated, with a good measure of self-praise and thinly veiled pleas for financial support, to the English noble Christopher Hatton, first Baron Hatton. More interesting than the letter of dedication is thePraefatio de huiusce libri utilitate(""Preface on the Usefulness of this Book""), where ten groups of people are listed who may profit from the work: (1) chymists who must know an author's name to order his works from a bookseller; (2) people interested in certain aspects of chymistry, since the book contains a thematical index (but in fact, it does not); (3) fans of a particular author, who will find a complete list of his works; (4) librarians, who will be enabled to ""burden their bookshelves with choice and exquisite books"" (ad scrinia librorum selectis et exquisitis libris oneranda); (5) booksellers, who will receive new ideas for their stock and additional customers; (6) people who want to defend chymistry, because it becomes evident that they keep good company; (7) authors (or their sons), who will take pleasure in finding themselves mentioned; (8) international readers, since they are informed about foreign books; (9) people interested in ""minerals and secrets""; (10) future editors of a corpus of chymical writings.TheChymical Libraryseems to have been a promising venture in financial terms, since the printers bothered to procure a royal privilege for five years. As soon as 1656, the work was reprinted outside the French king's jurisdiction in Heidelberg. In modern times, a facsimile of this edition with a preface by Rudolf Schmidt appeared (Hildesheim: Olms, 1969).","Besterman 1955–1956, vol. 1, col. 125.","Borel, Pierre‎(← links)","Borel, Pierre:Bibliotheca chimica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bibliotheca_chimica(last revision: 14.03.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The most important of these was the Hesse vicar Georg Draud. HisBibliographia classica(Library Divided into Certain Categories) was first published in 1611. An expanded second edition appeared in 1625. It is divided into two parts, but probably more for the sake of convenience than for material reasons. The second part has a title page of its own, but the pagination runs on. Between them, the two parts comprise nearly 1800 pages and enumerate over 30,000 titles, all of them in Latin (despite the announcement of books inquavis fere linguain the full title; in fact, books in the various vernaculars are collected in Draud'sBibliotheca exotica, 1610, 2nd ed. 1625). The whole is preceded by a dedication to the professors of the University of Marburg and a letter to the reader and rounded off by an index of authors ordered alphabetically by family name.What is special about the work, besides its sheer scope, is its elaborate thematic structure. This structure is similar to the one adopted by Gessner in thePandectaein some respects, but differs from it in others. The order of Gessner's 21 books combines several structural models, in particular the seven liberal arts, the philosophical subdisciplines and the higher academic faculties. Within each book, thematical categories follow each other in more or less logical order, within the single categories, one finds a non-alphabetical list of topics. Draud uses a three-tier system as well, but he subdivides his material according to the seven categories used in the contemporary catalogues of the Frankfurt book fair (which also were his main source according to the full title and the preface): theology; law; medicine; history, geography, and politics; philosophy (a very open category including the liberal arts and much else); poetry; music. Each of these categories is further subdivided by alphabetically listed topics. These can be quite specific (De malleorum scarificatione, ""On cupping at the knuckles"", p. 931) or very general (Medica in genere, ""Things medical in general"", pp. 931–33). Under each topic, the respective authors and their books are ordered by last name.A fair part of the titles adduced refers to the natural world. However, the natural sciences are by no means presented as a unified field, but are dispersed over various parts of theBibliotheca classica. Medicine is the only discipline to constitute a category of its own. Among the medical books, one also finds some biology because of its contribution tomateria medica. Geography (mathematical and descriptive alike) goes with history and politics. Most of the rest – mathematics, physics, astronomy, astrology, and cosmology, meteorology and earth sciences, alchemy and chemistry plus a number of minor disciplines – only appears on the level of the topics in the philosophy section. There, on finds headings likeAstronomica(pp. 1320–23),Colores(""Colours"", p. 1325bis),Doliorum stereometria(""Capacity measurement of barrels"", p. 1352),Exhalationes(""Evaporation"", p. 1370),Lapis philosophicus(Philosopher's stone, pp. 1398–99),Linea(""The line"", p. 1404),Mare(""The sea"", p. 1413),Metoscopia(p. 1422),Optica(pp. 1432–33) andSubterranea(""Things underground"", p. 1496) alongside titles such asMemoria artificialis(""The art of memory"", pp. 1416–17),Orthographica(pp. 1448–49) andSyrica lingua(""Syrian"", p. 1498). A few titles from mathematical musicology can be found in the music section. It thus becomes evident how far natural science was from constituting a conceptual unity, how much its disciplinary range differed from the modern one and how close many scientific disciplines were to other fields from which they are rigourosly separated today.The book apparently was a success and fulfilled its purpose. Several annotated copies testify to the fact that it was indeed ""used as a finding list"" (Maclean 2012, 205).","Maclean 2012, 57–58, 61, 205–06","Maclean 2009‎(← links)Bibliotheca universalis‎(← links)Draud, Georg‎(← links)","Draud, Georg:Bibliotheca classica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bibliotheca_classica(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

(For a similar text, see theManuductio ad medicinamprefixed toJohannes Antonides van der Linden'sDe scriptis medicis libri duo.) After a short dedication to eight doctors of philosophy and medicine, de Castro opens his work with a genial letter tosuis dilectissimis praxeos studiosis(""his most beloved students of medical practice""; these were perhaps private disciples at Verona, since no academic professorship is mentioned on the title page). The physician, de Castro states, should be a ""walking library"" (ambulans bibliotheca), that is, he should have read and digested the relevant literature. In the present work, he has tried to assemble only a small number of books in order not to overwhelm the student, but has nonetheless ended up with a few more than planned, because different authors excel in different kinds of writing.The main part of the work is not a list of books, but a discursive text, which runs to 78 octavo pages. After some introductory remarks (pp. 1–3), the account starts from the classics: theCorpus Hippocraticumand Galen plus the respective commentaries, other Greek and Roman authors, Avicenna and other writers from the Arab world (pp. 3–20). It is rounded off by a bibliographic overview of the various branches of learning in general (pp. 61–78). In between (pp. 20–61), one finds a mixed bag of medical subdisciplines such as pharmaceutics, surgery or medical astrology, topics such as fever, diseases of virgins or the parts of the body, and medical genres such asobservationes,consiliaor dictionaries. All these subjects follow each other without any recognizable order. This structure, quite peculiar for a bibliography, shows that the author conceived his book not for selective consultation, but for continuous perusal, and tried to provide the budding doctor with a varied and entertaining read. In line with this, de Castro writes a fluent and engaging Latin and often addresses the reader directly (p. 22):Memento Galenum non puduisse quandoque a mulieribus approbasse ac descripsisse remedia.(""Keep in mind that even Galen was not ashamed of sometimes approving of remedies proposed by women and of writing them down."") The importance of the various aspects of medicine – which are highlighted in capitals – and the virtues of the respective writings are explained in terse and graphic prose (p. 39):LIBER DE FLATIBUS Ioannis Fieni curiosus et necessarius. Thomae Fieni filii DE FORMATIONE FOETUS argumentorum energia inexpugnabilis.(""THE BOOK ON FLATULENCE by Ioannes Fienus [from Antwerp, end of 16th century] is full of interesting notions and indispensable. ON THE FORMATION OF THE FOETUS by his son Thomas is unbeatable in the force of its reasoning."")At the end of the volume, one finds two alphabetical lists of medical authors and of learned authors in general. In a kind of untitled afterword, de Castro once more apologises for the number of books enumerated in his work, this time giving the different gifts of different students as a justification: weaker minds may be content with fewer books, strong ones are better served with a greater number. In a short final note, he declares his allegiance to the Church and explains how he has dealt with forbidden authors and books – an interesting testimony to the problems of a catholic bibliographer in the age of the index.Although no reprints or new editions in the second half of the 17th century are on record, the basic concept of theLibrary of the Learned Doctorstill appeared attractive nearly one century after its original publication. In 1742, the physician and man of letters Andrea Pasta published the work in an expanded version, in which de Castro's text is supplemented and updated by means of long footnotes.","Besterman 1955–1956, vol. 2, col. 2495","De scriptis medicis libri duo‎(← links)Castro, Pedro de‎(← links)Ordo et ordinis ratio in legendis Hippocratis et Galeni libris‎(← links)Institutiones medicinae‎(← links)","Castro, Pedro de:Bibliotheca medici eruditi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bibliotheca_medici_eruditi(last revision: 13.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Its author Johann Jakob Scheuchzer focussed exclusively on books dedicated to the natural history of specific countries, because he intended theLibraryas aprodromus(""forerunner""), that is, as a backdrop and introduction, to hisNaturgeschichte des Schweitzer Landes, which he published in the same year 1716.The bibliography perambulates (a metaphor dear to Scheuchzer, see e.g. pp. 82, 117:… ingredimur…;Accedimus lento passu, Alpes transgressi …) the four continents Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Within Europe, which takes up more than 80% of the pages, Scheuchzer starts from the Iberian peninsula, which ""is the head of Europe"" (quae caput est Europae, p. 3) according to the popularEuropa Reginamodel, a depiction of the continent in the form of a queen. He then moves eastward and northward and ends with the British Isles and the major islands of the Mediterranean. The single geographical units are usually introduced by a short description of their geography and literary production, which often is explained in terms of the respective people's national character as sketched in John Barclay'sIcon animorum(1614). The exceptional length of the German part, for instance, which runs to 65 pages (whereas Carinthia and Carniola get less than one, p. 140) is justified by the following satyrical quote (p. 17):Plura, quam legerint, scribunt et suam famam ex voluminum, quae edunt, numero aut magnitudine aestimant.(""They write more than they read and assume their glory to be proportional to the number or size of the volumes they publish."") Within a given country, the material is ordered alphabetically by authors (for some of whom a few biographical data are also given). At the end, one finds anonymous works, mostly pamphlets about monsters and miracles. These are exclusively in the respective vernaculars, whereas roughly one half of the other works is in Latin.

The result – published four years later – was a massive bibliography of more than 1300 pages that contains more than 12.000 works of all kinds as the title indicates: extant or not, learned or not, published or still ""hidden"" (latentium) in libraries. In the end of his words to the reader (Ad lectores), Gessner summarizes the aim of his work in a distich:Non mihi, sed studiis communibus ista paravi:Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes.I have prepared this, not for me, but for our common studies,just as you, the bees, make honey not for yourself.This is followed by a dedicatory letter to Leonard Beckh. In it, Gessner laments the destruction and the loss of books and libraries and remembers especially the quite recent destruction of the library in Buda by the Turks (1526). Gessner sees hisBibliotheca universalisthus as a means to prevent the extant knowledge from getting lost. 
Moreover, he names the sources for his bibliography: he has,inter alia, consulted the catalogues of printers, visited many libraries in Germany and Italy, asked friends and other scholars, consulted ancient and medieval lexica (like the works by Stobaeus or the Suda). He states, furthermore, that he has read at least thepraefationesof those books that were available to him. 
Gesser also explains the structure of his bibliography (modus inquirendi) in the long dedicatory letter: It is ordered alphabetically after the first names of authors (i.e. Marcus Tullius Cicero is listed under ""Marcus""). Additionally, there is an index in the end of the work in which the surenames are also listed (i.e. Cicero, Marcus Tullius) in case one does not know the forename. (This arrangement is later followed in other bibliographies such as Johannes Antonides van der Linden'sDe scriptis medicis libri duo.) The single entries contain a short biography of the author, a list of the works and short description, details of the publication (e.g. printer, place of printing, editor, etc.), as well as often some comments and assements by Gessner himself.
Gessner announces two more parts in the dedicatory letter: One will contain a bibliography ordered according to fields of knowledge (secundum artes et scientias disponit), in which works by anonymous authors will be included as well. This part was published in 1548 as thePandectarum sive Partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Tigurini, medici et philosophiae professoris, libri xxi(Pandectae). However, only 19 of 21 parts were published at this time. Part 20 on medicine was never printed, and part 21 on theology appeared in 1549.
Another part should containlociandsimiliaon various topics that should be of help to everyone dealing with a certain topic and in need inspiration from early writers. This part never materialized at all.Its unfinished state notwithstanding, Gessner's bibliography was succesful and influential. It was epitomised several times, came out in a greatly expanded second edition in 1578 and over the following decades served as a model for several universal bibliographies such as Georg Draud'sBibliotheca classica.","Blum 1983, cols. 202–204Friedrich 2002, 402–404","Gessner, Conrad‎(← links)Prolegomena in Galenum‎(← links)De libris a se editis epistola‎(← links)De cometis‎(← links)De scriptis medicis libri duo‎(← links)Bibliotheca classica‎(← links)","Gessner, Conrad:Bibliotheca universalis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bibliotheca_universalis(last revision: 11.10.2021).",,MK,Yes,DB,

On astrological grounds, certain days were believed to be more or less favourable for this treatment. The propitious days of a given year were displayed, along with some additional information, in so-called bloodletting calendars (""Aderlasskalender"" in German), which belonged to the earliest text types concerned with natural phenomena to appear in print. In German lands in particular, they were published in great numbers from the mid-15th century. The investment for the printer was limited, and the demand must have been considerable. Two thirds of the calendars were in the vernacular, one third in Latin, the latter perhaps mostly for members of the clergy (in the monasteries in particular, a noteworthy bloodletting culture evolved; seeOsler 1923, 12–13). The better part of this extensive production is probably lost for good today, but nearly 200 surviving incunabula were collected and one hundred reproduced as facsimiles at the beginning of the 20th century (Heitz; Haebler 1905). Bloodletting calendars are anonymous broadsheets (only the printer, who may have been the author as well in some cases, occasionally gives his name) usually printed in two columns and comprising three essential components: some basic calendric information about the respective year, a list of the dates of the full and the new moon, and prescriptions (without any astrological explanations) when to let blood.The present example from the year 1471 is among the earliest preserved. It was published by Günther Zainer at Augsburg, who was one of the most prolific calendar printers and always seems to have named himself in the colophon. The text falls into four sections, the initial three of which correspond to the aforementioned components, while the last seems to be an extempore addition to fill some empty space.The first section, which takes up nine lines, gives the year itself (1471), its position in the solar cycle (24th), dominical letter (F), position with respect to the last leapyear (third year after), and golden number (9), as well as the dates of the most important church holidays.Section two occupies the better part of the first column and is structured by months, indicating the day, hour and minute of the full and the new moon for each of them. By some error, the month names have been shifted by one, so the information for January is titledFebruariiand so on down to the data for December, which are placed under the headingIanuarii.The third and longest section, which occupies the last quarter of the first column and all but the last quarter of the second, is the bloodletting calendar proper. Proceeding month by month again, it declares which days are propitious, whether the old or the young should be bled and which veins should be left untouched. In the section's opening subtitle, it is specified that these indications are valid for the healthy only, not for the sick,nam necessitas non habet legem, sed ipsa sibi facit legem(""for necessity has no law, but makes its own law"").At the end, directly before the colophon, two short poems (six and four verses) on bloodletting are inserted. Both are written in a depraved kind of hexameters and hard to understand. The second is worse than the first, which gives prescriptions for bloodletting regarding the young and the old, ending with the nice and memorable lineLuna vetus veteres, iuvenes nova luna requirit(""The old moon asks for the old [to be bled], the new one for the young""). The second poem seems to be concerned with the best time for the operation.The layout of the calendar is simple and clear. In contrast to many other examples, there are no illustrations or other ornaments. The Latin is terse (and looks even more so due to the numerous abbreviations), technical and formulaic.Coniunctioandoppositiomean the new and the full moon respectively,minutio, bloodletting.

Dates are given with reference to a saint's day in the styleferia sexta post Ambrosii(""on Friday after [the day of St.] Ambrosius"") orsabbato ante Lamperti(""on Saturday before [the day of St.] Lampert""). A day where blood can be let is eithermedia(""all right"") orbona(""good""). ""For the old"" and ""for the young"" is expressed aspro senili(parte) andpro iuvenili(parte). Which veins should not be incised is indicated by a formula consisting ofpraeterplus either a body part (praeter coxas, ""except for the hips"") or a certain vein (praeter cephalicam(""except for the [vein] of the head"").","Heitz; Haebler 1905, esp. p. 16 and table no. 4.",Sanitatis tuendae praecepta‎(← links)Anonymus 14‎(← links),"Anonymus 14:Bloodletting Calendar Augsburg 1471, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bloodletting_Calendar_Augsburg_1471(last revision: 06.02.2022).",,MK,,MK,

"Cordus, Euricius",Euricii Cordi Simesusii medici Botanologicon,,1534,Cologne,"Gymnich, Johann",16th century,Dialogue,"Biology, Medicine","Botanologicon(Google Books)Alternative link:archive.org,MDZ",599726,"The title of this botanical dialogue may be rendered asConversation about Botany. Whether its similarity to John of Salisbury'sMetalogiconis more than an accident, remains unclear. The book, which bears an advertising epigram by Cordus (who won fame not only as a botanist, but above all as an epigrammatist) already on its title page, is dedicated to the senate of Bremen, whereto he intends to migrate from his present residence Marburg, in a poem in hendecasyllables and a letter. In the latter, Cordus explains among other things that in declaring his opinion on some issues, but leaving others undecided, he has used the open form of the dialogue to prompt the reader to reflect on the topics discussed for himself (p. 5):Indicavi graves in quibusdam difficultates dubiumque, ut altius cogitaret, lectorem reliqui.In the quite extensive (c. 180 pp.) dialogue itself, Cordus introduces himself in a conversation with with three younger friends and former pupils, who visit him in his house at Marburg many years after he taught them in Erfurt. These are Johannes Meckbach (Megobacchus), Anton Schwarz (Niger) and the Frenchman Guillaume Bigot (Bigotius), who arrives a bit later than the others (p. 21). The fifth participant is Cordus' brother-in-law Johannes Ralla, who is not a doctor-cum-botanist as the others, but aseplasiarius, a pharmacist; as pharmacists are especially prone to botanical errors according to Cordus, Ralla is often singled out for criticism (e.g. p. 150). In addition to the speaking personnel, there are two mute persons, namely Cordus' wife and apuer(servant).The discussion first turns on the friends' respective life situations and on the present state of botany and pharmacology. Cordus has to endure much hostility from fellow botanists and from colleagues at the University of Marburg because of his innovative investigations in the true identity of many simples mentioned in the classical authors. Soon, the friends decide to undertake some botanical studies in Cordus' garden; they take some books with them, namely a short version of Dioscorides (minorem Discoridem) and two hefty tomes by Brunfels, presumably vols. 1 and 2 of hisHerbarum vivae eicones(pp. 27–28). The greatest part of the dialogue shows them walking through the garden, calling attention to various plants and discussing their identity while constantly comparing what the aforementioned and other authors have to say on the matter. At the end, they return to Cordus' house and the host invites them (with the exception of Bigot, who pleads a weak stomach) to a frugal meal.The dialogue is quite lively and emotional throughout, including much humour, irony and self-irony, but also some nostalgia and frustration. This, for example, is how Cordus presents himself to his interlocutors who have not seen him for many years (including a quotation fromAeneid2.274):Qui placet tibi barbatulus et rugosulus Cordus? Quantum mutatus ab illo est Cordo, qui ante XVI annos Erfordiae Marianum ludum aperuit …(""How do you like your unshaved and wrinkled little Cordus? How much he has changed from the Cordus of old, who opened his Marian school at Erfurt sixteen years ago …"", p. 9). Collocutors may interrupt each other with interjections (p. 12). At some point, Cordus whispers a secret in Meckbach's ear, which is rendered asN. N. N. N. N. N.in the text.For the modern reader, Cordus'Botanologiconis remarkable in two more respects besides its literary qualities: It demonstratesin actuthe close intertwining of fieldwork and philology in 16th century botany, and it is a masterpiece of self-advertisement. In an unobtrusive way, Cordus depicts himself as beloved teacher, generous host, central figure of an amiable circle of friends, but especially as an important, innovative botanist and doctor, who pursues his quest for truth and public utility in spite of the hostility of quacks and envious colleagues.A concluding differential index of plants of some 20 pages, advertised as anepitome(short version) of the dialogue, shows that the latter was meant not only for perusal, but also for selective consultation. Interestingly, this index was reprinted a few years later without the respective page numbers, thus as a self-contained work, as an accompaniment to a commented translation of Dioscorides (Pedanii Dioscoridis Anazarbei De medicinali materia, Frankfurt 1549). The work as a whole was republished in 1551 at Paris.",Dilg 1969,"Cordus, Euricius‎(← links)","Cordus, Euricius:Botanologicon, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Botanologicon(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

Monstrous births such as this were taken very seriously and were much discussed in early modern times. Jacob Ruf, the city surgeon of Zurich, took the occasion to issue a broadsheet, in which the twins were depicted in a woodcut and the event was described. It seems doubtful, however, whether he composed the Latin text himself, since he had not been to University and asked someone else to translate a German work of his into Latin at another occasion (see hisDe conceptu et generatione hominis). Since the text of the broadsheet is not perfectly legible in the electronic copy, a transcription is given first, whose single sentences are numbered for the sake of convenience.(1)Anno a Christo nato 1543, sexto Februarii, matutina hora quinta eademque minuta Scaffhusiae Helvetiorum nati sunt infantes duo, uterque feminei sexus, capitibus duobus, brachiis quattuor totidemque pedibus disiunctis, uno vero solido corpore a collo ad umbilicum usque, umbilici subtus vinculo propendente, ut apposita figura repraesentat.(2)Patri autem, civi eius urbis, Ioannes Duner, matri vero Elisabeta Hügelin nomen est.WOODCUT(3)Quemadmodum lacti superinducta concreta pinguedo facili casu aut motu dissoluta nulla prorsus ratione ad integrum statum reduci potest, tenellis, maturis tamen arborum floribus simillima, quos levis aura et quisvis imber facillime deicit et in nihilum redigit, ita etiam conceptum in utero materno virile semen huic arborum tenero flori lactisque concretae pinguedini similitudine apprime respondens pavore, metu et gaudio repentino variisque casibus, naturis item medicinarum diversimodis in primo, debili et tenero initio post conceptum statim ruptum, diffusum et distractum in matricis domicilio nulla ratione conglutinari et in idem redigi potest, in eum statum scilicet, in quem opera naturae ipsius a primo statim initio diffusum et destributum fuit.(4)Sequatur ergo monstrum vel prodigiosus partus aliquis omnino necesse est, etiam citra vulgarem naturae cursum.(5)Ceterum omnipotens et misericors Deus ex gratia sua fieri hoc permittit, nec abs re sane.(6)Sicut enim prodigia, ostenta et miracula omnis generis, cometas aliasque consimiles aereas et alias igneas impressiones haud aliter merito interpretari licet quam ex mera Dei gratia paternam admonitionem, ut paenitentiam agamus vitae prioris, quod nisi fiat, iuxta poenam praeparatam videamus, ad eundem modum haec monstra etiam haud aliud portendere cuivis apud se privatim aestimare licet.(7)Qua porro ratione talis foetus editus, naturale testimonium suppetit ipsa partus hora, articulus adeoque momentum temporis.

Below the woodcut, the phenomenon is first explained with the help of two other natural phenomena: Just as milk skin and the blossom of trees can easily be destroyed for good, physical or emotional influences can corrupt the male semen in the womb. The result is a monstrous birth (3–4). God lets such events happen in the same way in which He also creates comets and similar phenomena in order to make humans repent their sins (5–6). Starting from the exact moment of birth, one can understand how the positions of the planets in the zodiac have caused the extraordinary phenomenon; the stars were also responsible for the fact that the twins were born alive but died soon after (7–9). As the event bodes ill for all pregnant women, cities are advised to have physicians and midwives ready to help them.The sheet is anomalous in its learned character, which manifests itself in three respects: First, the event is explained in considerable detail in terms of two different sciences, namely medicine and astrology. Second, the text is in Latin, whereas the great majority of all broadsheets were published in the vernacular. Third, the author applies a highbrow style characterised by complex syntax, elevated, nontechnical diction and elaborate similes (see 3). Taken together, these features presumably prevented most people except academically trained physicians from understanding the text. Ruf's motives in designing this unusual broadsheet are unclear. Could its form be intended to lend greater authority to his call for action from the side of the city authorities, which constitutes yet another unusual feature?A simplified version of the broadsheet recurred eleven years later in the fifth book (fol. 44v) of Ruf'sDe conceptu et generatione hominis, which was dedicated, inter alia, to monstrous births. Moreover, the sheet was taken over into at least four collections ofprodigia(miraculous signs;Costa 2009, 70).","Keller et al. 2008, vol. 2, 415–29 (introduction, text, German translation, notes)Costa 2009Ewinkel 1995","Ruf, Jacob‎(← links)Keller et al. 2008‎(← links)Symbolum Oenipontanum‎(← links)Relatio de monstro vitulino-humano‎(← links)","Ruf, Jacob:Broadsheet on Conjoint Twins, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Broadsheet_on_Conjoint_Twins(last revision: 17.06.2021).",Costa 70 broad reception (but without the body text); first scientific approach to monstersCosta 74 early modern times: monstra as wonders; later: monstra as errors of nature,MK,Yes,MK,

In fact, this treatise on tracheotomy was a plagarized Latin translation of Nicolas Habicot'sQuestion chirurgicale(1620). However, as Monau suppressed Habicot's name, he made the work of the French surgeon accessible to an international audience and increased its prestige by translating the text into Latin and vouching for it with his own authority. This was all the more important, as from the perspective of the academic world, Habicot was a problematic figure: not only was he an outsider, but he was also locked in an acrimonious battle with the academic anatomist Jean Riolan. Indeed, Monau mentions the ""barber-surgeon"" Habicot on thefirst page of his preface(chirurgo-tonsor Abicot): if it were not for Habicot's attacks against Riolan, Monau writes, he would have experienced more thankfulness from Monau (maiores et a nobis gratias initurus) – perhaps this is a veiled way of saying that he would have identified Habicot as the author of the text (cf.Lembke 2017).The short Latin treatise of 41 pages is divided into a brief introduction and 12 chapters. In the first chapter, the operation is defined asartificialis bronchi divisio, per rationalem chirurgum facta. Then, the origin of the operation is discussed (ch. 2). The next part of the treatise is devoted to the anatomy of the bronchial area and the function of voice and breathing (ch. 3–6), followed by an overview of illnesses in the bronchial area (ch. 7–9). The last part of the treatise deals with the operation itself. Arguments for and against the operation are cited (ch. 10). Then, the preparations of the operation (ch. 11) and finally, the operation itself (ch. 12) are described. In the end, anengravingis added to illustrate the procedure and the instruments used.Monau took over the definition and all the example cases from Habicot's treatise. However, in the course of translating, Monau also adapted the text (for the following overview and examples, seeLembke 2017, 170–172). He shortened and rearranged some passages. Where terminology is concerned, he offered alternatives and gives recommendations, often with reference to the Greek etymology. He also added a few references to early modern anatomists, where Habicot had cited only ancient authorities. In addition, he anonymized his text, removing names of patients, indications of time and place from the example cases, as well as any 1st-person narrative (where Habicot drew from his own practice). Thus, from the case of a servant girl named Katherine, about 25 years old, who was wounded by a shot in 1594 near Pont Saint-Michel in Paris (Question chirurgicale,p. 77), the name Katherine, the year and the place are removed in Monau's rendering (p. 23). Moreover, Habicot's treatment of the girl, related in 1st person (ie luy feis une incision en ceste partie,p. 78), becomes an impersonal description in Monau (incisione per chirurgum ibi facta,p. 23).In the introduction to the treatise, Monau writes that many men of renown rejected even the attempt to make an incision in the throat.  In contrast, Monau declares his firm decision to adopt the practice after the example of French medicine (Nobis nobilissimae et ingeniosissimae Gallorum gentis exemplo summa iucundidate eam persequi stat sententia,p. 1). If it was Monau's attempt to advocate for this operation in the academic world, then he had some success: a second edition of hisBronchotomewas printed in Greifswald in 1649 and a third in Jena in 1711.",Lembke 2017,"Monau, Friedrich von‎(← links)","Monau, Friedrich von:Bronchotome, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Bronchotome(last revision: 09.02.2022).",,,Yes,IT,

The engraving appears in both of Rumpf’s posthumously published works, the DutchAmboinsche Rariteitkammer(Ambonese Chamber of Curiosities, 1705) and the bilingualHerbarium AmboinenseorAmboinsche Kruid-Boek(1744). The two editions of the image differ only in regard to the suspended reptile to the right of the scientist, which has disappeared in the later version. The text on the opened book on the left informs us that this portrait of the 68-year-old Rumpf is based on a drawing by his son Paul August (P. A. Rumphius filius fecit patrem)that was subsequently engraved by Jacobus de Later (J. de Later sculpsit) and printed by François Halma (F. Halma extudit).An engraved Latin epigram of two distichs is also part of the composition. As the subscriptionex tempore posuit N. S. Gub. Amb.indicates, the epigram was composed by Nicolaas Schaghen, who was Gouvenour of Ambon, the Indonesian island where Rumpf lived and conducted his research, from 1691 to 1696, meaning that the poem must have originated already in the nineties of the 17th century. The epigram reads as follows:Caecus habens oculos tam gnavae mentis acutos,ut nemo melius detegat aut videat,Rumphius hic vultu est Germanus origine, totusBelga fide et calamo: cetera dicet opus.Like the portrait, the poem draws attention to Rumpf’s blindness and opposes it to the keen eyes of his mind. Thus, it evokes the motif of the blind seer, a popular trope since antiquity (cf. e.g. the blind seer Teiresias). Paradoxically, with the eyes of his mind, the blind scientist Rumpf sees better than anyone else. The poem then provides a sort of summary of Rumpf’s life in geographical terms: He was born in Germany, but is now a true Dutchman concerning his loyalty (fides) and his writing pen (calamus): this points to the fact that Rumpf worked in the Dutch colonial trade and administration and that he wrote his scientific books in Dutch. Finally, the verses also touch upon the topos that is the most frequent and typical for portrait epigrams, namely that it is impossible to depict the intellect together with the outward appearance (vultus) – to the intellect, Rumpf’s book will have to testify (cetera dicet opus).",Arens 2018(on the image),"Schaghen, Nicolaas‎(← links)","Schaghen, Nicolaas:Caecus habens oculos (author portrait), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Caecus_habens_oculos_(author_portrait)(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,IT,Yes,IT,
Anonymus 9,Camera obscura,,1720,Cambridge,,18th century,Other (see description),"Physics, Other (see description)","London 1741,London 1755(Google Books),London 1772(archive.org)","695815(5th edition, London 1741)","Like theIrisand theIgnis fatuus, this poem belongs to the tradition of Cambridge Tripos Verses. On the first and the second Tripos Day, two Neo-Latin poems, usually written by undergraduates, were printed on a single sheet and distributed among the audience. In the first half of the 18th century, a considerable number of these anonymous poems were printed in anthologies, thus circulating among a wider readership. Many of these poems engaged with science in one way or other, as is also the case in this poem, in which an optical instrument, the camera obscura, provides the background for an idyllic, yet intriguingly unusalekphrasisof an upside-down ""moving painting"".The poem consists of 74 hexametres and is neatly structured: After a short proem (v. 1–3), the layout of the instrument is explained (v. 4–15). Then, however, a sort ofrecusatioof scientific didactic poetry follows (v. 16–28), creating a bridge to the followingekphrasisof the upside-down landscape captured by the camera obscura (v. 29–44). Miraculously, the image produced by the device is moving (v. 45–52); the camera obscura captures a rider (v. 53–55) and a pretty girl (v. 56–63). At the end, the instrument is opened and the sunlight extinguishes the picture (v. 64–74).Therecusatiosubverts one of the core topoi of scientific didactic poetry (and scientific writing in general), namely the teacher-poet asking to reader to look deeper than the surface and to investigate the hidden causes. Here, it is the other way around:Quare age, quae sensu fuerint magis obvia, mecum / conspice, nec causas rerum scrutare repostas. The poet is quite content with looking at the surface only, describing the spectacle the camera obscura produces; the scientific causes shall be explained by thephysicus, since is not possible for poets to know everything (another subversion of a literary topos).This announcement should probably not be read as a programmatic statement, but as a lighthearted turn to surprise the readers. Indeed, science is far from absent from the text: the poet explains the design of a camera obscura in some detail, mentions the Epicurean opinion on how vision works (v. 16–18), touches upon refraction of light in a lens (v. 19–22) and likens the upside-down image to how an uneducated person (rusticus) of the past might have imagined the world of the antipodes (v. 40–44).The poem was written for the second Tripos Day of 1720 and proved to be quite popular, as it was printed in a number of anthologies. In the year after the poem was handed out on a single sheet in Cambridge, it was included in a Cambridge anthology (Carmina comitialia Cantabrigiensia, London 1721) and twenty years later in theMusae Anglicanae(London 1741), an anthology of English Neo-Latin poetry (both anthologies were edited by Vincent Bourne). In 1755, it was published again in an anthology of Etonian Neo-Latin poetry (Musae Etonenses, London 1755). Eventually, it was attributed to Vincent Bourne himself and – like several other Tripos Verses – printed in a collection of Bourne's poetry in 1772. As part of this collection, it saw three more editions in the early nineteenth century, in1808,1826and1838.",Hall 2009,Anonymus 9‎(← links),"Anonymus 9:Camera obscura, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Camera_obscura(last revision: 25.07.2022).","Is the author indeed Vincent Bourne himself? In theMusae Etonenses, there is a handwritten note that reads George Graham.The effect of this announcement is heightened by the fact that at first the poet creates the impression that this is in fact a didactic poem. After the proem, a literary device is used that is typical for the genre, namely direct instructions to the reader (here to construct a camera obscura), making the reader believe this is a didactic poem. Therecusatioitself starts like a summary of the topics the teacher-poet is going to explain, only to take a surprising turn at the end.The poet likes creating paradoxical effects: light, while illuminating everything, extinguishes the picture in the camera obscura, the rider can be invited into the ""chamber"" without halting him, the girl without violating her modesty. As the poet likes playing with genres, can one say that he incorporates love poetry (puella) and epic (eques) in his poem?",IT,Yes,IT,

It is appended to Stensen’s work on muscles (Elementorum myologiae specimen seu musculi descriptio geometrica). It is followed by a description of the biology of these kind of sharks in the style of aHistoria animalium(Historia dissecti piscis ex canum genere). In the preface to the his treatise on the dissected head, Stensen justifies the fact that the long and uninterrupted treatise on the muscles must have become boring to his reader. Therefore, he now wants to present something different to offer some kind of variation (Non dubito quin lectori fastidiora fuerit longa et non interrupta rerum musculos spectantium expositio; quocirca, cum in varietate oblectationem animus inveniat, materiam priori subiungendam iudicavi, quae variis nec cohaerentibus inter se observationibus recensendis occasionem praeberet.p. 69).The work is famous for the first detailed argument that the so-calledglossopetrae, tongue-stones, are in fact fossiled teeth of a shark. The treatise also features a scientific approach in the sense that Stensen sharply distinguishes his observations – that come first – and his conjectures based on these observations – that come second. 
The illustrations to which the texts refers throughout are found at the end of the volume. The picture of the shark with an open mouth is taken from an unpublished plate by Mercati as Stensen states (p. 70). This is also the reason why it is titledLamiaalthough Stensen has argued (p. 70) that this is not the correct name for this kind of fish as theLamiashould be flat (this is already described in Pliny’sNatural History9,78).

There are seven tables, each of which consists of three parts which are printed on two pages facing each other. Angles (divided into steps of 10') are found in the horizontal rows, the vertical columns are grouped in three sections comprising of two columns with two of the headingsperpendicula,basisandhypotenusa. This is to be understood in the following way:Rheticus defines his trigonometric functions as ratios in triangles - for the first time in Europe - , wherein one side is of the given normed length of 10 Million (in order to avoid fractions). In the first two columns, this is the hypotenuse, andperpendiculadenotes the opposite side of the given angle, which is the sine. Correspondingly, thebasisyields the cosine.In the third and fourth column a right triangle is assumed where the longercathetusis of length 10 million. In such a triangle thehypotenusacolumn then gives the values for thesecans(the reciprocal of the cosine) and theperpendicula, the shortercathetus, yields the values for the tangent of the angle.Correspondingly, the fifth and sixth column (hypotenusaandbasis) contain the values for thecosecans(the reciprocal of the sine) and the cotangent. Here the shorter of the two catheti is assumed to be of norm length 10 million.Reading the table from left to right (with the angle α on the left side) gives the values for sin(α), cos(α), sec(α), tan(α), csc(α) and cot(α). Using relations of these functions for complementary angles (like sin(90°-α)=cos(α)) one can read the table from the right as well using the angle at the right side. Then one gets the functions cos(α), sin(α), csc(α), cot(α), sec(α), tan(α). The corresponding names are written at the bottom. Using this symmetry, the table could be cut by half.Furthermore, in each column also the difference to the following figure is given.At the beginning, a poem in 28 hendecasyllables by a certain Mathias praises Rheticus' accomplishment and provides an early testimony to the idea, commonly ascribed to Galilei, that mathematics is the key to the whole range of disciplines concerned with the natural world. While the make, purpose and use of most volumes of tables is explained in an introduction, in the present case this task is assigned to aDialogus de Canone doctrinae triangulorumappended at the end.This setup was certainly a milestone in mathematics, on which many following tabular works were based on. First of all, theOpus palatinum de triangulis, Rheticus's collaboration with his discipleValentin Othowho finished the tables after Rheticus's death. For these comprehensive tables the radius was set to 1010(ten billion) and the angle interval was 10"". In Viéte'sCanon mathematicus seu ad triangulaof 1579 the tables were organised in exactly the same way even using the same notions (basis,perpeniduclaandhypotenusa) as in Rheticus's. Even forty years after its publication, Rheticus'sCanonwas re-used byPhilipp Lansbergenin hisTriangulorum geometria.","Schöbi-Fink 2010, 34.Hischer 2016, 209.Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 11, 397.Braunmühl 1900, 145-148","Rheticus, Georg Joachim‎(← links)Triangulorum geometria‎(← links)Dialogus de Canone doctrinae triangulorum‎(← links)Opus palatinum de triangulis‎(← links)Canon mathematicus seu ad triangula‎(← links)","Rheticus, Georg Joachim:Canon doctrinae triangulorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Canon_doctrinae_triangulorum(last revision: 02.12.2021).","It might be worth while to check other 16th century paratexts to similar table works and to see if they, too, advertise the dry contents of the respective books with the argument that they are key to the understanding of nature.earlier information: most notablyPtolemy'stable of chords in Almagest 1.11) - also Regiomontan, Copernicus, ... - omit!","MK, FB",Yes,"DB, FB",

Nevertheless, it presents some novelties and it does so in a curious way.The work falls into two main parts: The trigonometric tables and theuniversales inspectionescontaining explanations, notions, diagrams, relationships in triangles, and so on.Thecanonstarts right away with the trigonometric tables whose appearance and organization is taken over from Rheticus'sCanon doctrinae triangulorumwhere the reader should be referred to for details.  The charts show the values of the six trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant) for an interval of 1'. The reference length of the norming side is 100,000 which seems less precise than Rheticus's, but the usage of decimal digits (in small print) yields about the same precision.
Even if the tables superficially seem to be copied from Rheticus, Vieta had used his own method of producing the numbers. It involved a tedious calculation of 13 decimal digits of sin(1') of which 10 were correct. Sines of other angles could then be calculated by angle addition and subtraction theorems.This main body of the tables is followed by several others, among them a table of right triangles with rational side lengths (i.e. Pythagorean triples) which are produced by a special rule (cf.Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol 14, 19).In the second part, theUniversalium inspectionum ad canonem mathematicum liber singularis, a table of contents is followed by a letter to the reader by the publisher Mettayer. The content falls into three parts: Plane trigonometry, spherical trigonometry, and ""planispherical"" trigonometry, that is, spherical triangles projected on a plane. Therein one finds a complete account of relationships in right and oblique triangles on the plane and sphere, but also relationships of the trigonometric functions themselves and also explicitly the above-mentioned addition and subtraction theorems. Pi is given as the half circumference of a circle of semidiameter 100,000 in the form 314,159,265,36indicating the decimal part by underlining it.The presentation of this second part is very schematic; there are annotated diagrams, explaining the notions in right triangles, equalities are written in tabular form (e.g.the law of sines on p. 23) and it seems that Viète avoided continuous text. The goal seemed to be a clearer account of the mathematical content unburdened from textual baggage. Only sometimes short passages of prose text interrupt the diagrams and tables.A second edition appeared in 1609 in Paris, but the work's overall success was probably limited (Braunmühl 1900, 158).","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol 14, 18–19.Braunmühl 1900, 156–183.","Viète, François‎(← links)Triangulorum geometria‎(← links)Canon doctrinae triangulorum‎(← links)","Viète, François:Canon mathematicus seu ad triangula, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Canon_mathematicus_seu_ad_triangula(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,

The beginning of hiscarmenis clearly reminiscent of Virgil's lines in the proem of theAeneid(1,8), when Grove writesMusa mihi, causas memora, quo ferveat igne. He outlines the blood circulation and stresses the novelty of this knowledge, which was not known to the ancients. This is explained with  allusions to ancient and early modern mythological and real sages and physicians, i.a.Hippocrates,Galenus,Andrea Cesalpino. In contrast with these scholars, who did not know about blood circulation, William Harvey is praised as discoverer of this new knowledge, shedding light on things hidden and obscure thus far and multiplying our knowledge about the human body and its functions.Thereafter, Harvey's method of anatomical research is described in a vivid and dramatic narrative: the vivisection of animals, in this case a dog. After securing him on the table, Harvey speaks to the animal and defends his method in the name of his discoveries. The appearance and function of the intestines within the body is explained, as they are observed while dissecting the dog. The description quite often uses the simile of the water cycle, as well as metaphors from the realm of warfare to describe both bodily functions as well as Harvey's actions when dissecting the animal. Harvey is e.g. standing over the dog like an ancientherosover his enemy in battle, before killing him. Different body parts are personified when their role within the system of the body is explained. Besides clear quotations of Virgil'sAeneid, Grove also uses allusions to Lucretius. 
After the blood cycle is described, Harvey addresses his colleagues, who were present at dissections like the one depicted, stresses the importance of his discovery and explains the causes of the observed phenomena. 
The poem ends with a long praise of Charles II., in which the horrors of the English Civil Wars are described, as well as the joy of peace, which the Restoration brought for the new king's subjects. This section shows an abundance of epic language and pathos. It includes a praise of a new scientific ""hero"", Robert Boyle, as well as numerous other scholars who will explore realms still hidden, underground as well as in the vast space of the cosmos.
Appended to the text are miscellaneous other poems written by Grove on different occasions, mostly academic occasional poetry, but also epithalamia and funeral poems, as well as two with medicinal content.","Partial English translation inMitchell 1912, p. 42–50.Agnew 1960","Grove, Robert‎(← links)","Grove, Robert:Carmen de sanguinis circuitu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Carmen_de_sanguinis_circuitu(last revision: 21.01.2022).",,"JL, IT",Yes,JL,

It was only a question of time until series of  lives of scientists would also begin to appear. Brunfels'Catalogue of famous physicians or About the first medical writersis an early example from the realm of medicine. Comprising some 80 quarto pages and dedicated to Brunfels' fellow physician Theobald Fettich, town doctor in Worms, the work is the fruit of long years of reading and excerpting, as Brunfels explains in the dedicatory epistle.Brunfels wants to list as many physicians as possible and has no inhibitions to include individuals whose connection to medicine is tenuous at best (e.g. Aristotle, pp. 42–50). The initial name index comprises some 330 individuals, which implies that only minimal space can as a rule be devoted to individual physicians. Some very famous representatives such as Hippocrates or Galen (pp. 7–12, 56–68) are given something like a proper biography, but many others remain nothing but names. The average entry comprises a few lines, is titled with the respective physician's name and may give some indications of his lifetime, teachers, pupils, fields of activity and works; the source authors are also named in most cases. Sometimes several physicians are lumped together under one heading (e.g. p. 35:De his, qui vites celebraverunt et vina, ""On those who wrote of vines and wines"", takenen blocfrom a chapter of Pliny'sNatural History).Although the account begins with Apollo and Paeon as the inventors of medicine, neither a chronological nor a thematic order is consistently followed. Ancient, especially Greek physicians receive the lion's share; they are also the only ones to figure on the woodcut adorning the title page. A few Arabic authors (Avicenna, Averroes, Mesue, Razes, Albaterius) are briefly treated on pp. 51–52 (cf.Hasse 2016, 60), scholastic and in general medieval physicians on pp. 27–28, 52 and 74–75, recent Italian ones on pp. 69–71.

As Jungermann was already mainly occupied with this task, it was Hofmann who basically prepared the publication of the catalog. The main part of the book consists of an alphabetical list of Latin plant names, at times with Greek or German synonyms and references to the works of botanical authorities, both ancient (e.g., Aristoteles, Theophrastus, Dioscorides) and modern (e.g.,Conrad Gessner,Leonhart Fuchs,Caspar Bauhin) who used a certain name.

Unfortunately, we do not have any information about the author, but his surname clearly suggests that he was a relative of Pope Gregory XIV. More interestingly, with such a text, Pandolfo was, without a doubt, trying to put an end to the large-scale and heated debates on the origin of tides among sixteenth-century natural philosophers, and the address to the Pope was supposed to support his ambition. In the introduction, Sfondrati states that although floods are rare in Rome, the treatise could be still useful for preventing undesirable water events. On the basis of numerous historical and empirical reports from across the globe, the author demonstrates a variable character of tides. In the end, he comes up with a dual solution. On the one hand, Sfondrati admits that the motion of the water is of mechanistic character and simply imitates the motion of the stars. Thus, the tides occur depending on the accumulation of the water in and geographical features of particular regions. The former is believed to take place in the areas where vortices or other underwater movements can happen; after accumulating the water beneath the surface of the ocean, they subsequently push it out. It is worth noting that Descartes later also interpreted the origin of tides through the vortex effect. The other cause, Sfondrati claims, is the influence of the sun. Through its movement, in the region in which it is located, the sun provokes the vapours that are responsible for the elevation of the water. Consequently, in the other part of the world, the water decreases.Although the latter cause was somewhat similar to Bernardino Telesio's theory (seeDe mari), Sfondrati's text was subjected to severe criticism by Telesio's fervent follower and one of the leading natural philosophers of the time, Francesco Patrizi. In book 28 (fols. 139v–140r) of hisNova de universis philosophia, Patrizi says that recently, that is some months before the first publication of theNova de universis philosophiain 1591, came out a treatise entitledCausa aestus maris, which treated the problem in question in much detail but provided ridiculous results. Patrizi never mentions the author’s name, but the fact that Sfondrati published his work a year before theNova de universis philosophiacame to light, also in Ferrara and with the same publisher can indicate that the respective chapters of Patrizi’s opus magnum in which he puts forth his own theory of tidal motion might have been conceived as a response to theCausa aestus maris.
There is no information about any other texts by Sfondrati. The style of theCausa aestus marisindicates, at least in part, why he is not known as a successful author of natural philosophical works. The Latin is far from elegant, sometimes it is hard to follow the author's argument. Compared, for instance, with Patrizi's account, which despite touching upon some complex issues is well structured, Sfondrati'sCausaoften lacks clarity and seems, in terms of its style, to be of a Latinised, not proper Latin, text.",,"Sfondrati, Pandolfo‎(← links)","Sfondrati, Pandolfo:Causa aestus maris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Causa_aestus_maris(last revision: 27.12.2021).","This is an example of an overambitious monograph. Dedicated to a pope and promising to solve the riddle of the tides once and for all. Earlier attempts are refuted in ch. 2. However, the solution proposed by the author in ch. 3 is as ludicrous as fanciful: the water tries to follow the sun from east to west but is stopped at the narrow straits of Magellan. Hence it flows back and causes various tides in various seas according to the local circumstances.There are no attempts at quantification. The author does not go beyond traditional Aristotelianism.

Especially the second part, the thorough description of the human body's nerves, was very influential and is by modern scholars considered the first accurate scientific depiction of the nervous system. But also his anatomy of the brain shaped later works by his fellow countrymen as well as physicians from continental Europe. Willis dedicates his work to Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, and to King Charles II. He presents his anatomical method, basing his knowledge of the human body on autopsy and empirical investigation, on the dissections of countless animals he and his fellow scholars had made, without the influence of philosophical speculation, only letting the bodies speak for themselves. Willis also speaks against – in his view – impious views like the Cartesian animalautomata. After explaining his method of dissecting the brain and themedulla oblongata, Willis describes thecerebellum, the brains of inferior animals (birds and fish), the cranion and meninges, the arteries of the brain, and therete mirabile. One of the key questions, which plays into the contemporary discussion of the location and character of soul and mind within the body, is the character and origin of thespiritus animales, aetherial gases or liquids, which were thought to be responsible for the transmission of nerve impulses. One section is also concerned with the pineal gland or epiphysis, which played a central role in Descartes' dualism of body and mind. In Willis' opinion, it could not form the connection between body and mind, since superior and even inferior animals also possessed an epiphysis, but certainly no intellect. The so-called ""Circle of Willis"" was named after the author, acknowledging his detailed description of the artery circle ensuring the brain's blood supply (which had, in fact, already been described in Johann Vesling'sSyntagma anatomicum).The second part of Willis' work is concerned with the nervous system, in particular with the location and roles of different nerve cords. 
Willis' monograph was printed again in Amsterdam in 1666 and spread widely among European physicians. It was accompanied by numerous detailed images, works of the anatomist, astronomer, and architect of St. Paul's Cathedral, Christopher Wren.

Secondly, some philosophical passages, especially in the second chapter, appear quite synthetical and/or short and might be considered matters of duty.

Editio secunda priori emendatior.",,1668,Rotterdam,Leers,17th century,"Dialogue, Translation",Alchemy/Chemistry,"The Sceptical Chymist (Lodnon 1661)(archive.org)Chymista scepticus (2nd edition, Rotterdam 1668)(Google Books)",695817(Rotterdam 1668),"Because of his fame as a natural philosopher and experimenter and of his habit to write exclusively in English, Robert Boyle became one of the most-latinized scientific authors of the 17th century (Fulton 1961;Burke 2007, 74; see alsothis list). In his most popular work,The Sceptical Chymist(1661), Boyle rejects the four Aristotelian elements (earth, water, air, fire) as well as the three elements postulated by the chymists of his day (sulphur, salt, mercury) and propounds a corpuscularian understanding of matter instead. According to him, all matter is composed of minute particles, which are distinguished from atoms only in their being divisible in principle. All substances perceived by us are compounds of different kinds of corpuscles, none of them corresponds to an element, that is, a substance consisting of one kind of particles only. This theory is proposed and the rival theories are refuted in the form of a dialogue reported by an anonymous narrator. The participants identified by name are Carneades, a philosopher from the sceptical branch of the Academy who in part acts as Boyle's mouthpiece, Philoponus, a chymist, Themistius, an Aristotelian, and Eleutherius, who does not belong to any profession or school and therefore is qualified to pass impartial judgement on the opinions proposed. The dialogue is subdivided into six parts and a conclusion. The volume starts from a lengthy ""preface introductory"", in which Boyle narrates the gestation of the work and explains its make and purpose, followed by a fragment of an earlier version, which for some reason was never completed (pp. 1–34). The dialogue itself runs to some 400 octavo pages and is subdivided into six parts and a conclusion.Only one year after the publication of the English original, an anonymous Latin translation appeared, which went through three more editions in 1668 (the first to be currently available online), 1677, and 1680. The translator's task was conditioned by the Ciceronian character of Boyle's work. The type of dialogue used – a narrative frame encompassing, instead of a true conversational exchange, lengthy speeches given by the participants  – is familiar from Cicero. The participants with their ancient names, two of which, Carneades and Themistius, represent philosophical schools, are also reminiscent the Roman orator. The dialogue's eponym and protagonist belongs to Cicero's predilected philosophical school. Finally, in his ""preface introductory"" (sixth to fifth last page), Boyle draws attention to the stylistic care with which his dialogue is composed – a trait it shares with the model of Latin style par excellence – and justifies some derisive remarks made by his interlocutors with the model of Cicero'sDe natura deorum. In brief,The Sceptical Chymistreads like a Ciceronian dialogue in English translation. To the translator, the idea to translate the work back, so to speak, into its original linguistic medium, Ciceronian Latin, must immediately have suggested itself. While he (reasonably) made no attempt at paraphrasing the technical terminology of early modern chymistry in the vocabulary of classical Latin, he happily imitated the long, leisurely periods characteristic of Cicero's style, in which thoughts are carefully unfolded and all their aspects laid open without any haste. Even in this respect, Boyle himself already had prepaired the ground by reproducing such periods in his English. A characteristic example is found at the beginning of the fifth part. There, Carneades answers an objection to the effect that natural substances may not be elementary, but chymists are able to produce elementary matter themselves. Carneades' reply starts as follows (p. 284):If you remember (replies Carneades) that at the Beginning of our Conference with Philoponus, I declar'd to him before the rest of the Company, that I would not engage myself at present to do any more then examine the usual proofs alledg'd by Chymists, for the Vulgar doctrine of their three Hypostatical Principles; You will easily perceive that I am not oblig'd to make answer to what you newly propos'd; and that it rather grants, then disproves what I have been contending for: Since by pretending to make so great a change in the reputed Principles that Destillation affords the common Spagyrists, 'tis plainly enough presuppos'd, that before such Artificial Depurations be made, the Substances to be made simple were not yet simple enough to be look'd upon as Elementary.In Latin, this becomes (pp. 255–56):Si meministi (regerit Carneades) me sub nostri cum Philopono sermonis initio coram societate reliqua ipsi significasse me nolle in praesentiarum amplius in me suscipere quam ut usitatas probationes a chymicis in receptae de tribus ipsorum principiis hypostaticis doctrinae patrocinium adductas examinem, facile intelliges non teneri me ei, quod nuper proponebas, respondere illudque largiri potius quam infirmare, quod hactenus ivi propugnatum, quandoquidem, dum obtenditur tantam fieri in putativis principiis, quae distillatio vulgaribus spagyricis suppeditat, mutationem, evidenter satis praesupponitur quod, priusquam depurationes eiusmodi artificiosae fiant, substantiae simpliciores reddendae nondum satis simplices fuerint, quae elementares haberentur.",,"Boyle, Robert‎(← links)Anonymus 16‎(← links)","Boyle, Robert; Anonymus 16:Chymista scepticus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Chymista_scepticus(last revision: 22.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In about 220 pages he deals with arthritis and gout that he explains as a result of a disorder in the ‘policy’ and the ‘constitution’ of the body. Tilton characterizes the work as a “rather more sophisticated version of a pharmacy window advertisement, in which Maier presents the sum total of his medical knowledge alongside extravagant promises aimed at those wealthy readers who might employ him (Tilton 2003, 202f.).” Hence, this treatise is quite easy to understand compared to Maier’s more arcane alchemical writings (e.g. theAtalanta fugiens).The work is not dedicated to a specific noble patron but to physicians, students of medicine and whomever is concerned with the fight against arthritis and gout. This group is addressed in a dedicatory letter, in which Maier also claims to follow the “dogmatici medici”, and especially those from Germany, rather than the “empyrici medici” (p. 7). After the dedicatory epistle, a quite elegant though at times laced with innuendo and opaque “Epigramma authoris” follows (pp. 10f.) that sums up Maier’s main points. The “Praefatio ad lectorem” (pp. 12–19) contains also the “divisio tractatus”: The book falls into two main parts: the first (“theorica”) explains Maier’s theory of the analogy between body and state and how a disorder results in arthritis and gout. This part comprises three chapters. The following part (chapters four to twelve) – named “practica” – deals with possible treatments of these illnesses. 
Maier argues that there is an analogy between the human body (microcosm), the state/society and the divine order (macrocosm). As in macrocosm where god is the ruler and the angels, the stars, the elements etc. are the citizens with their various duties and properties, the human body is organized like a state with the different organs and limbs as its citizens. Maier prefers – as in human society and macrocosm – a monarchy with the heart as king and the other important organs (lung, brain, liver, etc.) as aristocracy: “Nullum est dubium, quin monarchia sit perfectissima rei publicae forma, in qua potestas summa sit penes unum, sive regem sive principem.” (pp. 34f.) – “No doubt, the most perfect form of state is the monarchy, in which the highest power lies with only one, be it the king or the princeps.” The heart is king because it supplies the rest of the body with the so-called “calor innatus”, i.e. the inborn heat, or “spiritus vitalis”. Similar to the decadency of constitutions in Plato’s state (hear the different forms of government are, however, compared to the soul and total analogy is not claimed) a disorder in this optimal state can lead to different forms of government, aristocracy or – even worse – democracy and tyranny and, thus, leading to illnesses. Arthritis and gout are a form of tyranny when the heart does not care enough for the other organs and not enough “spiritus vitalis” reaches the outermost organs, i.e. hands and feet. Instead, superfluous material (“materia superflua”; “superfluitates”) amasses in these regions of the body that should usually be discarded (pp. 37ff.). Hence, the person suffers from arthritis and/or gout. As – according to Maier – too much of “Bacchus and Venus”, i.e. alcohol and sex, lead to this tyrannical state of the heart, the treatise contains a strong moral component.
As remedies for these illnesses Maier proposes mainly a golden powder and a mixture of Mercury and Sulphur as well as, of course, a morally sound lifestyle.","Tilton 2003, 202–208.","Maier, Michael‎(← links)De circulo physico quadrato‎(← links)","Maier, Michael:Civitas corporis humani, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Civitas_corporis_humani(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,DB,Yes,DB,

Older mathematicians are omitted as mythical or at least dubious, as announced in the title. However, the notion of ""mathematician"" is used much more inclusively than today, and not all figures treated are mathematicians in the modern sense of the word. The archaic Greek poet Simonides (p. 40), for example, is admitted because he added an eighth chord to the lyre (and, although this is not stated explicitly, because music was part of the quadrivium of mathematical disciplines). Also historically but hardly mathematically important persons like Pericles, Vitruvius, Pliny or the explorers Columbus and Magellan appear on the list. Some entries are incorrectly placed, as the one of Leonardo da Pisa (Fibonacci) who appears in the 15th century (p. 59) but actually lived around 1200. The knowledge of Arab mathematicians seems to be sparse. Al-Chwarizmi (Algorismi), for instance, who founded the mathematical branch of algebra is either completely omitted or perhaps treated, in an unsatisfying and misleading way, underBEN MUSA(p. 56).If a mathematician has distinguished himself as an author, his books are also listed. As a rule, the entries are short and terse. Theon of Alexandria (p. 53), for instance, is treated as follows:THEON Alexandrinus, cuius sunt Graeca comm(entaria) in Magnam Syntaxim Ptolemaei, praetera De arithmetica, De ortu Caniculae, De Nili ascensu, Commentaria in parvum astrolabium.

"Mersenne, Marin","Cogitata physico-mathematica, in quibus tam naturae quam artis effectus admirandi certissimis demonstrationibus explicantur",,1644,Paris,Bertier,17th century,"Other (see description), Encyclopedic work","Mathematics, Physics","Cogitata physico-mathematica(e-rara.ch)Alternative link:Google Books,MDZ",807648,"This is a massive compilation of works from the realm of mixed or applied mathematics, physics and music theory. Its contents, listed after the strangely titledPraefatio praefationum, comprise metrology (De mensuris ponderibusque et nummis Hebraicis, Graecis et Romanis ad Gallica redactis– i.e., an antiquarian topic), hydraulics and pneumatics (De hydraulico-pneumaticis phaenomenis), hydrostatics (Ars navigandi super, et sub aquis), acoustics and musicology (Harmonia), mechanics (Tractatus mechanicus) and ballistics (Ballistica, et acontismologia). However, the organisation of the book is somewhat confusing, as the titles in the table of contents are in part significantly different from the titles of the books in the compendium. The extensiveindexcomplements the first part of theCogitata. It comprises entries of all parts, but strangely, it is placed in the middle of the book.The compendium can be viewed as a new scientific bible of what by the beginning of the seventeenth century could be called 'new science'. Marin Mersenne's aim is twofold: on the one hand, he presents up-to-date research of famous contemporary scientists; on the other, he also touches upon his own findings (especially in the fields of acoustics and music theory). His active correspondence with the most renowned scientists of his time (like Descartes, Galilei, Fermat, Desargue, Hobbes, and many more) made him one of the first networkers in the history of science and. therefore, a pioneer of scientific societies. A Franciscan abbot in Paris, he dedicated his time to promote science by placing himself in the focal point of scientific correspondence and publishing processes. In this respect, he found himself well-informed about all major scientific trends, hotly debated questions, and proposed solutions. More importantly, he was a networker and promoter of new knowledge rather than someone who produced the new results himself.TheCogitatais a significant result of Mersenne's efforts. What is about to follow clearly illustrates it.First, the main part of Mersenne's own investigations was dedicated to acoustics, harmony, tunings and music theory. He found mathematical connections of chord length, thickness, tension, and tone pitch. At the time, before the broadly accepted well-tempered tuning, which owed its international success to Bach, he proposedvarious keyboardsin order to deal with different kinds of ""semitones"".In theHydraulicaone finds a praise of Galilei and other scientists entitledElogium utile. It expresses Mersenne's deep respect for the great scientists like Fermat, Descartes, Apollonios of Perge and especially Galilei, who was able to investigate the principles of the solar system. Mersenne goes on to claim that in case he might appear that he criticizes Galilei for certain miscalculations, this does not affect his admiration towards the Italian scholar and his pioneering.Later, in the ballistic section he does, indeed, criticise some results or conjectures of Galileo. The first one is concerned with the hypothetical path of an object on the equator falling to the centre of the earth. Galilei claimed that this path should be a semicircle, while in theCogitatait is geometrically shown that this contradicts the square-law for falling objects. Here Mersenne refers to a proof provided by Fermat, but it is worth noting that by the date of the publication of theCogitata, Fermat's finding had not yet been made widely available.Two other results by Galilei, so-called isochronous properties, are being questioned by Mersenne as well: the first one is a certain law-of-chords: Galilei had claimed in theDe motuthat objects rolling on a chord of a circle towards the lowest point always take the same amount of time. The second one is a presumed property of pendula. Its claim that the frequency of a pendulum only depends on the length of the pendulum and not on the amplitude was rejected by Mersenne as well as the law-of-chords. His own experimental results seemed to contradict Galilei's theoretical investigations.TheCogitatademonstrates Mersenne's broad interest in various fields of physics and applied mathematics and touches upon many areas of ongoing research in the 1640s.",Grosslight 2013Engelberg; Gertner 1981Naylor 2003,"Mersenne, Marin‎(← links)","Mersenne, Marin:Cogitata physico-mathematica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Cogitata_physico-mathematica(last revision: 26.10.2021).",,"OA, FB",Yes,"OA, FB",

On this occasion, Francesco Vigilio Grammatica, a colleague of Bacchetoni, ""out of due reverence"" (debita observantia ergo, as noted in the subscription) composed a concrete poem titledA Comet in Verse, Which Deadly Shone on Death. (Another poem for Bacchetoni, theIgnominia devictae mortis, would follow two months later.) This text was printed on a broadsheet and bound into some, but not all copies of theAnatomical Anthropology. It has the form of a comet with ten jags, each of which is formed by one elegiac distich, and a tail of one more.Read clockwise, starting from the uppermost jag and ending with the tail, the poem may be summarized as follows (cf. the transcription below): Dire Death (Mors, a feminine word, in Latin) riots all over the earth, sparing nobody. Will this calamity never come to an end? Hippocrates (who seems to be imagined as a kind of pagan patron saint of medicine) watches the disaster from the sky, becomes angry at Death and decides to send a strong opponent against her. He assigns the task to Bacchetoni, who duly enters combat (that is, he undergoes his disputation). Victory is his, because Death remembers that Bacchetoni has already beaten her twice before (namely in two earlier disputations, as explained in a footnote) and gives up. May she now lament, while the world rejoices! May Bacchetoni take up the crown due to him from Apollo (the god of medicine)! – An additional message is expressed by the first and last letter of each verse plus one in the middle, set in upper case so as to form three concentric circles of capitals within the comet. Read clockwise from the outside to the inside, they proclaim:BACCHETONI RUTILUM MEDICINAE SIDUS VIVE ET SANA(""BACCHETONI, RED-GLOWING STAR OF MEDICINE, LIVE AND HEAL"").Together with the title, this insert reveals the basic idea of the poem: The text's graphic form corresponds to the fact that Bacchetoni himself is styled as a comet. Comets are generally taken as bad omens, and the defendant is one, too, but not for mankind, as usual, but for Death. He is thus styled as a true medical superstar and perhaps even as a successor of Christ, who has vanquished Death and whose birth was greeted by the Star of Bethlehem, mostly visualised as a comet. Of course, no reader will have taken such hyperbolical praise serious, but most will have found the notion witty and amusing.Appendix: Transcription of the text in standard formatBarbara mors atro per mundum percita fastubacchatur tragicique iras infesta veneniasperat.

While the second of those poems (In huius operis commendationem) is devoted to praising the book and the author, the first poem opens the volume in more general terms with a panegyric on mathematics.In 19 verses, the divine nature of mathematics is vindicated emphatically. The ancients (stulta vetustas) were wrong in believing in many gods and demi-gods (v. 1–5); however, if there were someone who was justly called a god, the Lady Mathematics has the power to render humans immortal and similar to God (v. 6–11a). Mathematics teaches men everything that they are allowed to know; with her keen eyes, she is able to see everything in the heavens and on earth, and Lady Nature shares her secrets with her like with a dear sister (v. 11b–19).In the poem, mathematics, a scientific discipline and method central to early modern science is praised by means of a personification, in the guise of the Lady Mathematics. According to ancient hymnical poetry, Mathematics is adorned with various titles (v. 7–8:magna illa tonantis / filia, scrutatrix rerum, ingeniosa Mathesis, ""that great daughter of the Thunderer Jupiter, the explorer of things, ingenious Mathematics""). In the second half of the poem, a plethora of rhetorical figures like anaphora, homoioteleuton, and tricolon add pathos to the hymnical praise in the second half of the poem.Cornelius Grapheus' pair of panegyric poems was printed again in 1584, in the paratext of the second edition of Dodoens' introduction.",Sphaera CorpusTracer,"Grapheus, Cornelius‎(← links)","Grapheus, Cornelius:Commendatio divinae Mathematices, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Commendatio_divinae_Mathematices(last revision: 21.01.2022).",Scrutatrix rerum may be inspired by Cicero's hymn to philosophy (inventrix legum).,IT,Yes,IT,
"Mundinus, Lucius,Berengario da Carpi, Jacopo",Carpi Commentaria cum amplissimis additionibus super Anatomia Mundini una cum textu eiusdem in pristinum et verum nitorem redacto,,1521,Bologna,"Benedetti, Girolamo",16th century,"Commentary, Encyclopedic work",Medicine,Commentaria cum amplissimis additionibus super Anatomia Mundini(Google Books),701513,"TheAnatomia(1316) by the surgeon and Bolognese professor of medicine Lucius Mundinus was the standard work on anatomy in Italy's late medieval and early modern universities. The public dissections, which formed part of the medical curriculum, were conducted with its help: while the body was cut open and one organ after the other shown to the audience, Mundinus' text was read out aloud in order to explain what people saw. In the early 16th century, Jacopo Berengario da Carpi, one of the foremost surgeons and experts in anatomy of his time, wrote an extensive commentary on theAnatomiaand had it printed, together with the work itself, as a tome of over one thousand quarto pages.The book starts from a letter of dedication to Giulio de' Medici, the future Pope Clement VII, and is concluded by eight woodcut illustrations depicting the muscles and bones of the human body (including a naked crucifixion), a detailed table of contents, two pages of corrections, and seven poems of praise by five colleagues. Text and commentary are arranged in a form quite common in early commentary prints (cf., for instance, Capuanus'commentary on Peuerbach'sTheoricae novae planetarum): short to medium-length text and commentary sections alternate. Da Carpi's book features 40 numerated text sections, each of which is followed by its commentary. The text, which seems to have heavily deteriorated over the last 200 years, has been corrected by da Carpi. He proudly claims in the title to have ""restored the text to its original, true lustre"" (textu … in pristinum et verum nitorem redacto) and repeats this assertion in a subscription after the last text portion (fol. CCCCCXIIIIv). The exposition, structured by subtitles and equipped with marginalia, is several times as long as the text, although it is set in smaller font and single-spaced. It starts from an introduction (fols. IIIIr–VIIr), whose opening sentence provides important information about da Carpi's goals and how he plans to reach them:Visis tot et tantis altercationibus inter scribentes de anatomia plac[a]uit mihi, quod longa experientia vidi secando et vivorum et mortuorum corpora et quod longa lectione quaesivi, per viam commenti in unum breviori quodam summario perstringere. Et dux meus erit optimus Mundinus Bononiensis.""Having seen so many heated quarrels between the writers on anatomy, I decided to compose a tract and by way of a short summary to bundle up all that I have seen in my long professional experience while opening bodies alife and dead as well as the things sought by me in long hours of reading. My guide will be the excellent Mundinus from Bologna.""Thus, da Carpi does not primarily aim at explaining Mundinus. It rather is his goal to produce a self-dependent encyclopaedical treatise (commentum, notcommentarium) on anatomy, in which he wants to summarize his own experience as a practicing surgeon and a conductor of public dissections plus the contents of the pertinent literature (which he knows very well; ""short summary"" is false modesty, of course). Mundinus' work functions as a structuring device in this context. Da Carpi's practice is congruent with his theory. When a section in Mundinus such as the discussion of themesenterion(""mesentery"", fols. CXVIIIv–CXIXr) poses no particular problems, the commentator has no qualms to skip it and to proceed straightaway to his own agenda:Haec littera est clara, lege eam, quia hic loci non conteritur tempus(fol. CXIXv; ""This section is clear. Read it, because I waste no time here."")Although da Carpi is able to write Ciceronian prose, as is evident from his dedication, he is indifferent to stylistic niceties in the body of his work. His main concern is clarity. In strong contrast toVesaliusa few decades later, da Carpi has no ambition to reform anatomical terminology or to purify it from 'barbaric' terms. He simply  takes the expressions most in use in his own time, be they Latin, Greek, or Arabic.hepar(ἧπαρ) is used for ""liver"" in spite of the common Latin equivalentiecur, cotilido (κοτυλήδων) for ""suction cup"",mirachfor ""abdominal wall"". Even apart from anatomical terms, a lot of non-classical Latin is used (iuvamentum, ""function"";colligantia, ""connection""), as well as classical expressions in scholastic meanings (quantum ad,  ""regarding"";littera, ""section""). In terms of syntax, the reader not only encounters standard middle Latin constructions likequodinstead of accusative with infinitive,suusinstead ofeius, and ablative of the gerund instead of present participle (continuandoforcontinuans), but even such strange syntagmata ashabeo tueriformihi tuendum est, ""I must protect"" (all examples from fols. CLXXXIVv–CLXXXVr).Given Mundinus' and da Carpi's standing, the quality of the commentary and the importance of the subject, it is strange that the book apparently was never republished. That it was estimated highly for a long time is shown by the present copy, which was bought in 1606 by the Munich college of the Society of Jesus. In terms of modern research, few early modern commentaries have been served as well as Carpi's. The knowledgeable and insightful analysis byFrench 1985is of great help. This entry is much indebted to it.","Lind 1975, 159–165French 1985","Berengario da Carpi, Jacopo‎(← links)Mundinus, Lucius‎(← links)","Mundinus, Lucius; Berengario da Carpi, Jacopo:Commentaria cum amplissimis additionibus super Anatomia Mundini, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Commentaria_cum_amplissimis_additionibus_super_Anatomia_Mundini(last revision: 16.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Thomae Bravardini Anglici Tractatus proportionum perutilis,,1506,Bologna,Hector,16th century,Commentary,"Mathematics, Physics",Commentaria in Tractatum proportionum Alberti de Saxonia(e-rara.ch),735146,"While Sacrobosco'sSphaeraprobably was the only work of scholastic science to attract numerous commentaries in early modern times (cf.Opusculum spericum cum commento et figuris), less known texts found commentators from time to time as well. An example is the present commentary on theTreatise on Proportionsby the German 14th century logician, physician and mathematician Albertus de Saxonia which is based on Thomas Bradwardine'sTractatus de proportionibus velocitatum in motibusand treats contents partly covered by the well-knownElementsof Euclid. Benedetto Vettori, the author of the commentary, was a humanist doctor of arts and medicine. His interest in the treatise may have been professional, since mathematics played a certain, albeit modest, role in early modern medicine (Maclean 2002, 171–181, esp. p. 171 n. 99).In a short letter, Vettori dedicates his commentary to the count and humanist Alberto Pio di Carpi from the house of Savoy. Albertus's text and Vettori's commentary fill fols. 1r–48r of the book, which is concluded by Thomas Bradwardine'stractatus(without any commentary, fols. 49r–58r). Albertus's treatise falls into two parts, the first of which (fols. 2r–20v) subdivides proportions into a number a varieties, each of which is defined and described. The second part (fols. 20v–47v), separately titledTractatus de proportione velocitatum in motibus(""Treatise on the Proportion of Velocities in Motion""), applies proportions to the theory of motion, discussing in turn the causes of motion, their effect, and circular motion. Albertus' text and Vettori's commentary are presented as chunks of text set in roman script and blackletter respectively and alternating on the page, a layout often applied in early prints of commentaries. The commentary is many times as long as the text, although for reasons unclear, the final part, on circular motion, remains uncommented.The annotation is problem-oriented, as its better part is taken up by the discussion of specific questions arising from Albertus' text. Their introduction by the formulaDubitatur utrum(""One doubts if""), printed in larger font, makes this aspect immediately visible. The commentary is even concluded by a table of doubts (tabula dubiorum, fol. 48r) listing 33 items. Vettori's discussion of these doubts is tightly structured. For example, Albertus' distinction between rational and irrational proportions and his exemplification of the latter by the ratio of the side to the diagonal of a square (fol. 3v) provokes four doubts. The second (fol. 4v) asks why it is impossible to provide a numerical value for the aforementioned geometrical ratio. To answer this question, three lemmas (suppositiones) are first established (Dicamus ad hoc ex triplici suppositione. Prima est … Huius suppositionis prima pars claret supra. Secunda autem … Secunda suppositio est … Tertia suppositio …). On this basis, two proofs for the truth of the matter are given (His habitis duplici ratione dicamus ad dubium. Prima est … Secunda ratio …). On occasion, Vettori also makes use of formal syllogistic reasoning. His arguments are moreover clarified by simple, meticulously explained diagrams and backed up by references to authors and works like Euclid'sElements, Averroes and in particular Aristotle'sPhysics. The striving for clarity is conspicuous also in the commentary's linguistic texture, which is marked by technical terms being repeated ad libitum, simple syntax, the consistent spelling out of logical relations between statements by conjunctions, and cross-references. The first of the two abovementioned proofs, for instance, reads as follows:Quaelibet quantitas cuilibet quantitati incommensurabilis a nullo certo numero denominatur, praesertim quum[? unclear abbreviation]ipsius ad aliam proportio non est sicut numeri ad numerum ex prima suppositione. Sed quantitas diametri quantitati costae est incommensurabilis, ut demonstratum est supra. Ergo ipsa ab aliquo numero minime denominatur. Ergo proportio ipsius ad costam non erit sicut numeri ad numerum. Quare et proportio diametri ad costam a nullo numero denominatur. Quod erat propositum.""Every quantity whatsoever which is incommensurable to another quantity whatsoever cannot be expressed by a certain number, since its ratio to the other quantity is not like the ratio of a number to a number according to lemma one. But the quantity of the diagonal is incommensurable to the quantity of the side, as has been shown above. So it can in no way be expressed by some number. So its ratio to the side is not like the ratio of a number to a number. Therefore the ratio of the diagonal to the side is not expressed by any number. This is what has been claimed.""","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 1, 93–94.","Vettori, Benedetto‎(← links)Albertus de Saxonia‎(← links)","Albertus de Saxonia; Vettori, Benedetto:Commentaria in Tractatum proportionum Alberti de Saxonia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Commentaria_in_Tractatum_proportionum_Alberti_de_Saxonia(last revision: 02.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It was chosen for the first ever printed Latin version of Pseudo-Ptolemy's astrological text (Naples: Mayr, 1512). Even thoughGiovanni Pico della Mirandolain hisDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricemclaims that he found more than six hundred errors in Pontano's translation of theCentiloquium, the latter was republished numerous times in the sixteenth century, in most cases together with a massive and detailed commentary by the same Pontano.Pontano’s approach to the text is marked by two major points. First, he abstains from using any form of Islamic astrology. Openly representing himself as a follower of Greeks and Romans, Pontano does not even mention the major commentary on theCentiloquiumfalsely attributed to Haly ibn Ridwan. At the same time, he was familiar with the text itself and employed it without indicating its Arabic origin: he simply calls it ‘the Greek interpretation’. Confirming his desire to clarify complex astrological calculations in the dedicatory letter to Federico, Duke of Urbino, Pontano applies one central argument throughout the commentary: each major section starts with the exploration of an astrological term, its philological essence, and subsequent interpretation in the ancient world. Pontano applies the same method in other writings including his astrological prose work, theDe rebus coelestibus. In addition, having ancient astrological texts in mind, Pontano, himself a poet, usually explores obscure astrological terms or techniques with the use of literary analogies. Secondly, despite his clear fascination with restoring ancient, Greek and Roman astrology, Pontano’s project remains within the traditional Aristotelian intellectual framework as supplemented by Christian teaching.
Pontano combines these major trends in his commentary on theCentiloquium. While exploring the first conclusion of theCentiloquium, on the possibility to predict the future, Pontano claims that astrology has the same value as other important and recognised disciplines such as medicine and philosophy. Pontano asserts that there are two distinguishable approaches to astrology. The first, which deals with demonic powers, is called insane and mad. The second, however, in accordance with Ptolemy’s notion operates with mathematical calculations. Pontano adds that in the Roman period not only mathematicians but also poets were responsible for providing predictions. Hence, he comes up to his idea that predicting future events is open only to those who acquired divine inspiration. In this context, astrology and poetical art, which is impossible without a kind of similar divine influence, each become closely and fundamentally related. He goes on to say that poetry is a substantial part of theology, moral philosophy, and astrology, and a poet must investigate the positions of stars in order to succeed in his art.",Soldati 1906;Rinaldi 1999;Soranzo 2011;Rinaldi 2013,"Pontano, Giovanni Gioviano‎(← links)Ps.-Ptolemy‎(← links)Apotelesmata astrologiae Christianae‎(← links)","Ps.-Ptolemy; Pontano, Giovanni Gioviano:Commentarii in centum Claudii Ptolemaei sententias, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Commentarii_in_centum_Claudii_Ptolemaei_sententias(last revision: 28.06.2021).",,,Yes,OA,

Apart from providing a translation, taken fromJean Ruel's 1516 edition, and a comprehensive explanation of all plants mentioned and explored in Dioscorides'Materia medica, Mattioli describes numerous additional plants, animals, and minerals. To the three kinds of alum mentioned by Dioscorides, for instance, he adds five more which were unknown to the ancients, but are common in his own times (p. 616). Accordingly, the commentary is many times as long as the primary text. The 'overgrowth' of the original text by the commentary is announced already on the title page, where the commentator's name is much more prominent than that of the ancient author. The encyclopedic nature of the work is underlined by a massive index.Mattioli first published his opus magnum in Italian in 1544. Due to its success, the work was later published in Latin and other European languages (French, Czech, German). In 1560 Mattioli noted that 32.000 copies had been sold so far (a figure that impressed later authors, cf.Habermann 2001, 173–74). The commentary continued to grow over the years, as evidenced by the comparison of the two volumes on display: while the 1554 edition comprises some 700 folio pages, this figure has doubled in 1565. In 1571, Mattioli produced a short version, in which the work changed from commentary to compendium, theCompendium de plantis omnibus.","Riddle 1980, 18–19, 92–96Pavord 2005, 243–251","Mattioli, Pietro Andrea‎(← links)De materiali medicina‎(← links)Compendium de plantis omnibus‎(← links)Commentarii in sex libros Pedacii Dioscoridis Anazarbei de Medica materia(redirect page) ‎(← links)De ratione distillandi aquas‎(← links)","Mattioli, Pietro Andrea:Commentarii in sex libros Dioscoridis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Commentarii_in_sex_libros_Dioscoridis(last revision: 04.02.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,OA,

It was Simon Grynaeus who persuaded Camerarius to write this glossary (Baier 2017, 79). A short letter by Grynaeus is included in the volume (Baier 2017, 78–80), but the introductory letter is addressed to Wolfgang von Werthern (Bolgangus Theodici F[ilius] Vuerterensis;Baier 2017, 79). In this long introduction, Camerarius discusses the importance of rhetoric and apt expressions in any field of science and knowledge. He stresses that is not sufficient to have knowledge or expertise if one is unable to communicate this knowledge (Facile enim perspici potest inutilem esse cognitionem et scientiam, quam verbis declarare nequeas, fol. α2r). The universal languages of scholars all over the world are and will be Latin and Greek (Nam ubicunque locorum ac gentium vita degantur, sermo doctorum Latinae et Graecae linguae erit, fol. α2r). The correct use of terminology is crucial in this respect (α2v). Camerarius furthermore refers to the theory ofimitatio: Facts and things (res) can only be communicated through language, which is based onimitatio(Baier 2017, 86–89). This long introduction is followed by the aforementioned letter to Grynaeus. Moreover, one finds two indexes of words and things: one in Latin before the body of the main text, and one in Greek at the end of the volume.The glossary itself is printed in two columns and discusses medical terminology, not in alphabetically ordered lemmata, but in a continuous text arranged by thea capite ad pedesprinciple. The columns, as well as the lines, are numerated throughout, which makes it easy to find the references in the indexes. Camerarius continuously references and quotes Latin and Greek authors in order to substantiate his claims. His primary aim is not to inform the reader about human anatomy and physiology but to enable him to understand and correctly use the respective nomenclature.

Eiusdem commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum, in quo de resolutione, diffinitione et demonstratione necnon de materia et fine logicae facultatis quam plura continentur ad rem ipsam tum mathematicam tum logicam maxime pertinentia, ad Ferdinandum de Mendozza virum illustrissimum, fol. LXXIr–CXr",1547,Rome,Blado,16th century,Monograph,Mathematics,Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum(Google Books),902202,"This shortMonograph(one of the various meanings ofcommentariumin early modern times)on Certainty in the Mathematical Disciplinesby the Sienese astronomer, philosopher, and poet Alessandro Piccolomini, published only as the second and shorter part of a larger volume, nonetheless turned out to be one of his most influential works.After a short dedication to a certain Ferdinandus de Mendozza, the work's rationale is explained in a preface. TheCommentariumtakes its cue from a passage in Averroes' commentary on Aristotle'sMetaphysics, in which the Arab scholar asserts that mathematics attains to the highest degree of certainty. This statement has been understood in the sense that mathematical proofs are so-calleddemonstrationes potissimae(""most perfect proofs""), that is, proofs that demonstrate not only the truth of a statement but gives also the reason why it is true. Ironically, no one seems to have had a clear idea of what ademonstratio potissimashould actually look like; cf.Schöttler 2012, 33–34. Piccolomini, however, defines this notion in requesting it to be a syllogism in the first figure with a universal premiss which is prior or better known than the middle term: The latter should be a definition or a unique property serving as a proximate cause for the conclusion. Using elementary theorems fromEuclid'sElementsPiccolomini demonstrates in contrast that mathematics does not and cannot fulfill these requests. Most importantly he shows that there is no hierarchy of mathematical properties allowing to find a proximate cause. Furthermore, he demonstrates that mathematical reasoning in geometry uses arguments that are far from the ""essence"" of the figure in question and therefore cannot serve as anycausein the Aristotelian sense.The work proper is divided into twelve chapters provided with helpful subtitles. Before Piccolomini can demonstrate what he intends to, he has to prepare the logical and mathematical ground. This is done in considerable detail, which indeed takes up the better part of the treatise (chs. 1–6 and 7–10 respectively). The real discussion of the problem is then conducted in the last two chapters. Piccolomini first makes clear that none of the four Aristotelian causes has a place in mathematics, which excludes the possibility of ademonstratio potissima(ch. 11).  Then, he shows that mathematical statements do indeed possess the highest possible degree of certainty, but that this is due to the very nature of the mathematical objects themselves (a position already taken by medieval thinkers such as Thomas of Aquinus; ch. 2). A conclusion (peroratio) succinctly restates these results.The style of exposition may be termed scholastic with regard to language and mode of thought. The text is satiated with scholastic terminology, including, for instance, the substantive use ofesseas ""existence"", such rare formations assubalternare(""to subject"", fol. LXXXVIIIIr),organizatus(""structured""?, fol. CIXv) and abbreviated formulas likeErgo &c.(""So etc."") to conclude an argument. References to and Latin and Greek quotations from the tradition of Aristotelian exegesis abound, and the respective authors are invoked in their capacity as authorities throughout (for a particularly striking instance, see fol. CVIIr–v).What looks like a quite abstruse piece of philosophy of mathematics from a modern perspective had in fact a considerable impact. In reaction to Piccolomini's treatise, the so-calledquaestio de certitudine mathematicarumwas discussed in a great number of publications such as inPietro Catena'sOratio pro idea methodi(1563),Christoph Clavius'sProlegomena(1612),Giuseppe Biancani'sAdditamentum de natura scientiarum mathematicarum(1615),John Wallis'sMathesis universalis(1657) orThomas Hobbes'sExaminatio et emendatio(1660). Ultimately, this discussion resulted in the insight that the Aristotelian framework is inadequate when it comes to understanding the nature of mathematics, which had a liberating effect on the discipline and thereby benefitted its further development. But also natural sciences adopted the paradigm shift from Aristotelian arguments to the mathematization of phenomenona.",Schöttler 2012Mancosu 199610-33,"Oratio pro idea methodi‎(← links)Additamentum de natura scientiarum mathematicarum‎(← links)Piccolomini, Alessandro‎(← links)Prolegomena‎(← links)Mathesis universalis‎(← links)Examinatio et emendatio‎(← links)Exercitationes geometricae sex‎(← links)","Piccolomini, Alessandro:Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Commentarium_de_certitudine_mathematicarum_disciplinarum(last revision: 14.03.2022).",fol.

Instead, he is compared to a great ancient predecessor and found superior. The main reason given for Kepler's supremacy  has nothing to do with the scientific merit of his system, he rather appears to outdo Ptolemy in a kind of athletic contest: he is able to throw a heavier weight than the latter. However, a more appropriate reason is hinted at in lines 7–8: Kepler's system is more economical, since it has no need of Ptolemy's many epicycles.This idea is spelled out in greater detail in a second epigram (simply titledAliud, ""Another One"") of four couplets, which explicitly appeals to Occam's razor in its last lines:Numquam fieri per pluria[sic,metri causa]debent, / constitui possunt quae breviore manu(""What can be achieved with less effort, should never be done by a greater number of means"").",,"Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Virginianus, Saxirupius‎(← links)","Virginianus, Saxirupius:Comparatio Ptolemaei et Kepleri, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Comparatio_Ptolemaei_et_Kepleri(last revision: 05.01.2023).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

TheCommentarieswere thereby turnded into a different kind of book, namely a handbook or vademecum for students of botany and medicine. However, their encyclopedic scope is preserved, as already highlighted by the titleCompendium Treating All Plants. ""All Plants"" means exactly 921 species which are discussed on as many quarto pages.Mattioli's letter of dedication to Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria is noteworthy for the precise explanation of the author's motive's:Nam cum non pauci, qui discendae medicae materiae magno ac ferventi tenentur desiderio, me saepe rogarent, ut in eorum gratiam atque usum compendium conscriberem, in quo plantarum icones cum nominibus et compendiosa earum historia extarent, ut eo duce quaecumque loca, ubi stirpes proveniant, tuto ad eas noscendas indagandasque adire possent, ne de sua ipsorum in me confidentia frustrarentur, compendium hoc in eorum usum conscribere decrevi, quod quamvis succincto ac Laconico sermone conscriptum videatur, erit tamen, ni fallor, et gratum et perutile, non solum iis, qui indagandis noscendisque simplicibus medicamentis navant operam, sed iis quoque, qui hanc facultatem iam adepti publice morbis omnibus passim medentur.""Many of those who have a great, ardent desire to learn about medical substances, have often asked me to compose for their help and use a compendium, which should contain images, names and concise descriptions of plants, so that they could with this guide safely visit all the places where plants grow, in order to learn about them and to research them. To avoid that these people may see themselves deceived by their confidence in me, I decided to compose this compendium for their use. Although it appears to be written in a brief and laconic style, it will nonetheless, if I am not deluding myself, be welcome and most useful, not only to those who make an effort to research the simples and learn about them, but also to those who already have acquired this knowledge and heal all kinds of illnesses everywhere in public service.""After the dedication, Mattioli prints another letter to his friend, the Veronese pharmacistFrancesco Calzolari, whoseIter Baldiis appended to theCompendium. Next comes a full index of all the plants discussed – an important feature, since the order in which they are presented by Mattioli is difficult to see through.By contrast, each single plant is presented according to a unitary scheme and in a very reader-friendly way. On one page, one finds a well-executed woodcut alongside a text structured all or most of the following headings:Nomina, ""Names"" (given not only in Latin, but as the case may be also in Greek, Arabic and the major European vernaculars);Genera, ""Kinds"", that is, different varieties;Forma, ""Appearance"" (which is described roughly from the leaves down to the root and includes also non-visual properties such as the taste);Locus, ""Habitat"" (which may include countries, landscapes such as mountains or woods, and types of soil);Qualitates, ""Qualities"" (hot, cold, dry, moist, alongside with some general effects following from these qualities);Facultates / Vires, ""Abilities / Powers"", that is, medical uses; andCensura, ""Assessment"", where Mattioli exposes other authors' errors. Marginalia provide the sources for the information given under each heading, in most cases Mattioli himself, but also authors such as Dioscorides, Galen, Avicenna and Mesue. The type size varies so that the one-page-per-plant rule can be kept.Given the enormous success of Mattioli's commentary on Dioscorides and theCompendium's wealth of information and convenient layout, it is surprising that the work apparently was never reprinted.",,"Commentarii in sex libros Dioscoridis‎(← links)Mattioli, Pietro Andrea‎(← links)","Mattioli, Pietro Andrea:Compendium de plantis omnibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Compendium_de_plantis_omnibus(last revision: 06.02.2022).",Encheiridion,MK,Yes,MK,

He explains that his uncle (who had been an expert of Aristotelian philosophy) left him in charge of his manuscripts at the time of his death and that the presentSummary of Natural Knowledge according to Aristotleforms part of this heritage (fol. 3 r–v). However, one does not learn why it took the nephew over 50 years to produce the edition after Barbarus' death in 1493 and how far he intervened in form and content of the manuscript. The book is concluded by a detailed table of contents (fols. 75r–79v).As one can deduce from fol. 3r–v, where the work's title is paraphrased astotius philosophiae naturalis compendium, itsscientia naturalisis a synonym for (Aristotelian) natural philosophy. This subject is treated in five short books. Book 1 discusses fundamentals. Book 2 is devoted to cosmology. Books 3 and 4 deal with the sublunar world in general and different meteorological phenomena in particular. Book 5 concludes the whole with a summary of psychology. Zoology as well as the subjects of theParva naturaliaare left out, but otherwise, this order conforms to a then common way of structuring Aristotle's natural philosophy – from fundamentals and the skies to the sublunar world and living beings. Each book is divided by subtitles into shorter sections comprising a few lines to a few pages.The style is clear and, apart from technical terminology, Ciceronian, but also concise and presuppositional. The discussion of the so-called ""common sense"" (sensus communis), for instance, begins as follows (fols. 65v–66r):Diximus de iis animae viribus, quae externae nuncupantur. Nunc de internis agendum est. Cum itaque sensilium particularium differentias nullo sensu externo cognoscere valeamus, necessarium est, ut eam nobis inesse virtutem fateamur, qua sensilium omnium per sensus internuntios receptorum iudicium habeatur.""I have told of those faculties of the soul which are called external. Now I have to discuss the internal faculties. Therefore, since we are unable to discern the differences between particular perceptible things by any external sense, we necessarily have to concede that we possess an ability by which judgement can be made about all sensory impressions which we receive by the senses as messengers.""It is hard to imagine that someone could have grasped Aristotelian physics on his own  from such a condensed treatment. As an aide-mémoire, on the other hand, it could have done good service. Be this as it may, the work proved successful, not in Italy itself, but north of the Alps, where it was republished in 1547, 1548, 1550, 1552, 1554, 1579, and 1597.

The author of this paper onThe Great Efficiency of Lightning Conductors as Demonstrated by Three Recent Examples, Johann Jakob Hemmer, was a recognized authority on the subject, as he had designed a new type of conductor and issued a practical handbook in German (Anleitung, wetterleiter an allen gattungen von gebäuden auf die sicherste art anzulegen, Mannheim 1786, second et. 1788). That his report is written inter alia to promote the still relatively new technology, is not only evident from its title, but also expressedly stated at the text's beginning and end (§§ 1–2, 31).Hemmer tries to convince his readers of the usefulness of lightning conductors by discussing in 31 paragraphs three recent cases in which buildings have been saved from lightning strokes. These cases concern the church of Saint Reinoldus in Dortmund, the house of a noble in Oppenweiler, Swabia, and a gunpowder deposit on the Danish island of Amager. The first two conductors have been mounted by the author himself, while the third case is reported to him in a letter by the Danish scientist Thomas Bugge (§ 29).The writing is technical in many passages, but becomes quite vivid in others. The terror of a great thunderstorm can be described in an impressive way and the tempest may even be personified (e.g. § 16), as is also the case with the instrument itself, which is even praised in the style of a hymn at one occasion (§ 25). The account is further vivified by a strong personal element. There is much first person narrative. Hemmer describes in great detail his installation of the conductors and his personal investigation of them after lightning has struck (e.g. §§ 4–7, 19–23). In general, he comes accross as a prudent and successful expert, but he does not shy away from occasional self-criticism (see § 27, where he describes an error committedper imprudentiam singularem, ""by egregious imprudence"").While Hemmer's paper aims at promoting conductors and his own achievements on that front, as said before, this clearly is not his only goal. Much information is given about aspects without promotional value. For instance, Hemmer goes to great lengths to describe the damages done to the conductors, including deformation, rupture, melting and even chemical change (§§ 10–12, 19–23). The respective remarks are complemented by a number of illustrations at the end of the volume. Such information seems to be meant as raw material, so to speak, for a better understanding of the phenomenon of lightning in general in the future. This impression is reinforced by the fact that many observations are reported which the author himself can explain only very tentatively or not at all at the moment (e.g.§§ 9–10, 27).",,"Hemmer, Johann Jakob‎(← links)","Hemmer, Johann Jakob:Conductorum fulmineorum vis egregia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Conductorum_fulmineorum_vis_egregia(last revision: 22.06.2021).",Descriptions of the damaged conductors very graphical!,MK,Yes,MK,

The only astronomer who devoted an entire book to its refutation was the Bolognese professor of mathematics, Giovanni Antonio Magini. As Magini died on the 11 February 1617, his refutation presumably was published posthumously as well, although this is not mentioned in the paratextual apparatus.After the title page and the imprimatur, Magini'sRefutation of Scaliger's Treatise on the Precession of the Equinoxesis introduced by five letters by the author, other astronomers and Italian potentates to each other and to the reader. These letters describe the difficult conditions under which the work was written and published. Above all, however, they serve to demonstrate that Magini speaks not just for himself, but for his fellow astronomers as well.TheRefutationitself begins with a preface (pp. 1–7), in which Magini briefly sketches the universe according toPtolemyandCopernicus, including the problem of the precession of the equinoxes. After this introduction, the author goes through Scaliger's work and engages with crucial passages in the manner of a commentary or a dialogue. Under the headingScaligerand between inverted commas, the respective passage is quoted verbatim, followed by the author's response under the headingMagini. In his comments, Magini meticulously points out Scaliger's factual errors. More importantly, he constantly attacks his methodology. Scaliger, Magini contends, puts too much trust in the authority of poets and grammarians while paying no attention to the observational evidence produced by the astronomers themselves and to the mathematical substructure of astronomy. The following quote from p. 26 epitomises this approach:Veri astronomiae cultores non ita facile approbant, quae ab aliis ruditer et historice audiunt, sed illorum opinioni acquiescunt, qui suas hypotheses firmis demonstrationibus ac observationibus muniunt, nec credunt se aliquid certo scire, nisi hoc ipsum per observationes idoneas constet vel demonstrationibus geometricis confirmetur. At unus Scaliger omnes observationes negligens, licet praestantiorum artificum, obstinate nimis ac pertinaciter patrocinium eorum auctorum suscipit, qui floruerunt in infantia Astronomiae. Qui si reviviscerent, absque dubio opinionem suam desererent et Experientiae rerum magistrae acquiescerent.""True adepts of astronomy do not accept so easily stories which they have heard from others without any further confirmation. Rather, they are content only with the opinion of those who substantiate their ideas with strong proofs and observations. They do not think they know anything for sure, if it is not fixed by appropriate observations or corroborated by geometrical proofs. Scaliger alone neglects all observations, although they have been made by excellent experts. All too stubborn and obstinate, he takes it upon himself to defend those writers who flourished when Astronomy was still a child. Would these old authors come to life again, they would undoubtedly abandon their opinion and let themselves be convinced by Experience, the teacher of facts.""For the rest, Scaliger is mostly treated respectfully as a great man and superb scholar. However, this is partly the merit of the Roman censor who deleted a number of more malicious comments. In any case, Magini is adamant in denying Scaliger any astronomical expertise whatsoever. In the very last sentence, he states (p. 87)hunc virum alioquin eruditissimum fuisse, sed in geometricis et astronomicis infelicissimum(""that this man was most learned, but completely incompetent in geometry and astronomy"").In its firm refusal to accept the authority of an astronomical layman who fails to conform to the discipline's standards, no matter how great or important he may be otherwise, Magini's treatise exemplifies the self-reliance and self-esteem which the astronomical community has gained by the early 17th century. At the same time, the reader also gets an impression of the deepening trench between professional astronomers and the republic of letters at large.","Grafton 1983–1993, vol. 2, 485–86","Magini, Giovanni Antonio‎(← links)De aequinoctiorum anticipatione diatriba‎(← links)","Magini, Giovanni Antonio:Confutatio diatribae Scaligeri de aequinoctiorum praecessione, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Confutatio_diatribae_Scaligeri_de_aequinoctiorum_praecessione(last revision: 26.01.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The extraordinary cold of this winter, acknowledged still today as the coldest winter in the last half-millennium (Pain 2009), affected life severely across Europe but was particularly hard felt by populations across France and Germany (Assaf 2009). The phenomenon was of course, then, of great interest to early modern natural philosophers.After a short preface of two pages, Remus’ dissertation is divided principally into two sections. The first (pp. 1–29) offers a ‘history’ of the Frost, in which Remus’ five periods of the event are described and his records of daily temperatures are listed. Remus also deals with some methodological issues related to accurate temperature measurement and he describes the results of the season’s windy conditions before moving on to the winter’s effects on bodies of water, plant and human / animal life he witnessed. The second section of the work (pp. 29–51) offers Remus’ thoughts on the potential causes of this especially harsh winter. He deals first with the reasons for winter in general, treating the variation in distance between the sun and earth at earth’s apohelion and perihelion, the tilt of the earth’s axis and the potential effect of sun spots. He rejects, however, these phenomena as causes of this winter’s harshness. Instead, he finds its cause in the particularly windy and overcast conditions of the season (p. 41). He then goes on to relate his cause to the conditions in each of the five periods he has identified.Remus’ dissertation became the principal source for the Royal Society’s account of the Frost by William Derham (Derham 1708/09). Derham offered his own account of the conditions in Britain, supplemented with information out of numerous letters from British colleagues before moving on to the rest of Europe, where Remus’ text (given to Derham by John Woodward) is analyzed in detail.

Compilations ofconsiliabelong to the earliest medical, and indeed to the earliest scientific, texts ever printed. The present collection constitutes a particularly impressive example. Published a few years after the death of the renowned Paduan physician Bartholomaeus de Montagna, it contains some 350 of hisconsiliafilling no less than 650 folio pages in small and dense two column print. There is no title page and no colophon either. The above bibliographical data are taken from theIncunabula Short Title Catalogue. Any form of page count is missing as well. In a short preface, an anonymous editor extolls medicine in general and explains his intention to preserve de Montagna's hitherto scatteredconsiliain the present collection. Theconsiliaproper are followed by a table of contents and a catalogue of c. 400 recipes.The singleconsiliadiffer greatly in length, comprising between less than one and fifty columns. Longerconsiliaare structured by subtitles. Shorter ones typically start from a concise description of the respective health problem. Next, its aetiology is explained. This is followed by dietetic prescriptions, which mostly follow the pattern of thesex res non naturales. Finally, recipes for a number of medications are provided. In several cases, the occasion on which theconsiliumhas been produced, is noted at the end. Theconsilium de nutritivis xxix(pp. 525–26 of the digital copy), for instance, was writtten at ""Vicenza, 1438, 20th of June, in the house of Bartolomeo de Porto, by magister Bartolomeo de Montagna""). It is possible but not certain that these are the cases in which the author visited the patient in person, while he only gave a telediagnosis in the other cases. The aetiological part of aconsiliumis argumentative, the prescriptions are mostly given without further rationale. De Montagna often speaks in the first person, putting his own authority in the balance. In theconsiliumjust mentioned, for instance, he writes:Sed ego credo evidentius quod ardor urinae ipsius provenerat ex ulceribus inconvenienter curatis …(""But I believe it to be quite obvious that the heat of his urine originated from badly treated ulcers …""). In this case, he also polemicises against other doctors, as he continues:Pigritaverunt enim medici in administratione mundificantium et abstergentium et incarnantium …(""For the doctors were lazy in the administration of purifying, abstersive and flesh-producing medications …""). As these examples showcase, de Montagna's style is a medical variant of scholastic Latin: Aquod-sentence is used instead of a classical accusative with infinitive.Eiusis replaced byipsius. Rare and perhaps self-coined abstract nouns (administratio), adverbs (inconvenienter) and verbs (pigrito,mundifico) abound.As demonstrated by numerous annotations in thepresent volume, the Montagna's  medical advice was attentively read. Indeed, various collections of hisconsiliawere reprinted until the early 17th century (for an example, see thesecond digital copy).","Agrimi; Crisciani 1994, esp. 58–60, 74, 78–79",Bartholomaeus de Montagna‎(← links)Consilia medica‎(← links)Tractatus cum consiliis contra pudendagram seu morbum Gallicum‎(← links),"Bartholomaeus de Montagna:Consilia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Consilia(last revision: 16.02.2022).","Later eds. of the consilia are apparently ordered according to Avicenna's Canon, books 3 and 4 (cf.Agrimi; Crisciani 1994, 78–79)",MK,Yes,MK,

The dedication does little more than sing the praise of the House of Austria. The preface to the reader, in contrast, is more informative (although not reliable in every respect, see below). Doctors, Venusti states, are always in need of one another's help. He, therefore, has often given advice to colleagues. Some of the respective cases are collected in the present volume. Eachconsiliumstart from an assessment of the patient's temperament and condition. This is followed by an account of the disease itself, including its causes and symptoms. Next, the course of disease and the outcome are predicted. Finally, a cure is proposed. Where an opportunity presents itself, discussions of theoretical questions related to the case at hand are inserted (something already announced on the title page:multae et arduae quaestiones medicae pertractantur, ""many difficult medical questions are discussed in detail""). The last introductory paratext is a table of contents, which lists theconsiliain an order corresponding neither to their succession in the book nor to the often adduced order of diseases in books 3 and 4 of Avicenna'sCanon; it could be chronological.The body of the book comprises 216 quarto pages and contains 28consilia. In contrast to Venusti's announcement in the preface, not all of them are aimed at other physicians, at least not ostensibly. Rather, most are addressed directly to the respective patient (e.g. no. 6, pp. 6–7), a few also to a relative (no. 3, pp. 1–5). In practice, however, theconsiliawill have been read and pondered by the attending physician(s), who had the technical expertise and the Latin to understand their advice and put it to use. In no. 9 (pp. 137–43), it is Venusti himself who presents his proposed cure for an old man suffering from syphilis and asks an anonymous colleague for his opinion. The title of eachconsiliumindicates the patient in the formPro X, ""For X"". If he is not the addressee, the latter is given in the formAd Y, ""To Y"". Content and structure of theconsiliabasically correspond to what has been said in the preface. The cure usually includes a number of recipes of medications, which are partly set apart typographically, partly (e.g. p. 143) integrated into the running text. In general, the advice given is characterised by a strong interpenetration of medical practice and theory. Quotations from classical and recent authorities, in particular Hippocrates and Galen, are all over the place. At any point, the discussion of the specific case may be interrupted for the sake of a more general question. In the abovementioned case of syphilis, for instance, it is pondered at some length how the French disease fits into the Hippocratic and Galenic classification of diseases (p. 138). Marginalia keep the reader oriented. Given the diversity of topics cropping up, one would have expected an index, which is however lacking.The style shows some traits of medical scholasticism (cf. Bartholomaeus de Montagna'sConsilia), but this is tempered by the relaxed, cultivated Latin of a humanist letter. In fact, the originalconsiliawere apparently sent as real letters, and most of them still preserve some epistolary characteristics such as a flattering address to the recipient at the beginning and an assertion of Venusti's affection plus a farewell formula at the end:Hactenus satis mihi multa videor medice dixisse pro tua salute, quam quidem certe plurimi facio faciamque, dum vivam.

Astrologiae defensio contra Ioannem Picum Mirandulanum. Gabrielis Pirovani philosophi De astronomiae veritate dialogus absolutissimus, pp. 167-211",1498 [1554],Basel,,15th century since invention of printing,Monograph,Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Contra Picum(Google Books),733808,"Lucio Bellanti was a physician and astrologer from Siena. Little is known about him, apart from that he was born to a wealthy and noble family and obtained a degree in medicine. In the 1490s, he also composed a horoscope of his famous contemporary, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, according to which the count of Mirandola was to die at a young age. It is no surprise, then, why Pico's sudden death in 1494 at the age of 31 propelled Bellanti's reputation. However, in 1495, when Bellanti arrived in Florence, he discovered that Pico, whom he allegedly admired, had composed theDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem, one of the fiercest attacks on astrology the world had yet seen. Disappointed at the news, Bellanti decided to defend astrology against Pico, or, more precisely, against those who, in his view, had incited Pico to write theDisputationes. The chronology thus suggests that Bellanti had read Pico's anti-astrological treatise in manuscript, prior to its formal publication in 1496. Bellanti's work came out only in May 1498, a few days after the execution of Girolamo Savonarola, whom Bellanti had accused of distorting the original text of theDisputationes, as well as of fooling its author and turning him into a religious radical. Therefore, Bellanti'sResponsiones contra Picumhad a clear polemical and anti-Savonarolan dimension. At the same time, it offered the first systematic response to Pico's arguments against astrology and earned Bellanti extra fame among his contemporaries and the scholars of subsequent generations who objected to the central premise of theDisputationes- that astrology ought to be dismissed altogether as a discipline full of discrepancies and could not be reformed.Bellanti's treatise is structured with a particular goal in mind - to reject Pico's claims one by one. That is why it consists of 12 books and mirrors the number of books in theDisputationes. Bellanti's main polemical strategy is to invert Pico's argument, taken from a respective book, against himself. For instance, whilst Pico stresses that Plato and Aristotle's silence over astrology is indicative of their negative attitude, for Bellanti it means exactly the opposite. Bellanti also questions his opponent's expertise in astrological matters, suggesting that theDisputationescould have only been written by someone who was absolutely ignorant of the field he tried to challenge. This remark most probably targeted Savonarola and his followers, who prepared theDisputationesfor publication and, according to Bellanti, significantly modified it.
The style of Bellanti's prose is scholastic, with no evident signs of his adherence to the humanist belles lettres. He also operates within a traditional framework, substantiating his position on the validity of astrology with references to scholastic doctors and the Aristotelian tradition. However, due to the topic he touched upon and the context in which it was written, Bellanti'sContra Picumremained a valuable read well into the sixteenth century and contributed greatly to the controversy concerning the authorship of Giovanni Pico's last treatise.",,De astronomiae veritate‎(← links),"Bellanti, Lucio:Contra Picum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Contra_Picum(last revision: 24.07.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

Peder Horrebow'sCopernicus triumphans(The Triumphant Copernicus) is such a – albeit erroneous – proof. Described as aapodixis tot iam saeculis exoptata(""demonstration, which has been awaited for so many centuries now"", p. 6), it was printed on the author's expense on the occasion of the 28th birthday of Christian VI, who was then heir to the Danish throne and, according to Horrebow, was the driving force behind the publication of the observations. The birthday gift seems to be intended to impress the future ruler with the skills of the Danish astronomers and to recommend the patronage of the discipline to him.Horrebow explains in the first chapter that he owes the demonstration of the parallax, based on the fixed stars Sirius and Vega, to his teacher Ole Rømer and his observation diaries, from which he cites in the course of the treatise. In the third chapter (p. 9), he adds that he offered a first version of the demonstration to Christian’s father, King Frederick IV, as a new year's gift in 1715. The first version was written on the basis of Rømer's observations in Copenhagen, but in the present print, Horrebow also includes Rømer's observations in hisobservatorium Tusculanumin the Danish countryside, at least in part (quatenus eas charta capere non recusat, ""as far as the paper does not deny them to be included"").The title page characterizes the 58-page print as atractatus epistolaris, a treatise in letter form. Indeed, the core of the work is a treatise of thirteen chapters, structured into numbered paragraphs, which is embedded into a letter frame addressed to Christian. While the Danish prince is thus honored as the dedicatee of the print, it is clear that the treatise at the heart of the print is aimed at a wider audience. In a postscript at the end of the treatise (p. 56), Horrebow states that he realised only when the work was in press that it exceeded the length of a letter and had a different form than a letter. However, he hopes that the reader will react kindly to this ""little sin"" (peccatillum), as it was committed to their advantage.The demonstration of the stellar parallax is presented in a technical-mathematical style, with several tables of observational data and many calculations, including logarithms, but there are also more rhetorical passages when theCopernicus triumphanspolemicizes against opponents of the ""true system of the world"", especially in the tenth chapter where Horrebow contrasts the Catholic stance and his own experience in Protestant Denmark, where he defended and thought the Copernican system at the university for twenty-one years without anyone getting angry about it (p. 39). At several points, Horrebow adds force to his polemics with rheotical devices such as rhetorical questions, irony, or anaphoraa and tricola. For example, when he asks how the Catholic church will react to a proof for the movement of the earth, he concludes (pp. 35-36):Sed interim patitur iustus, interim suspenditur Copernicus diu etiam mortuus, interim modis indignissimis exagitatur Galilaeus aliique.(""But in the meantime, the just person suffers; in the meantime, Copernicus, who has been dead for a long time, is suspended; in the meantime, Galileo and others are attacked in the most unworthy manner."") In another instance, Horrebow takes on one particular anti-Copernican author in a long apostrophe (pp. 40-41).The treatise is as confident as its title. In the fifth chapter (pp. 21-22), Horrebow challenges theAnti-Copernicanito provide a plausible explanation for the observations without the movement of the earth and mockingly promises that he will switch to their side and ""state against all other experiments and saner physics that the earth does not move"" (statuam, contra omnia cetera experimenta et saniorem physicam, tellurem haerere immobilem). At the same time, he encourages other astronomers, particularly those of Paris, England and St. Petersburg, to scour their records, stating that he has no doubt that they will find the same parallax hiding in their observations. In the same vein, Horrebow states in the twelfth chapter on the use of the parallax that the Copernican system is no longer a hypothesis, but a demonstrated fact, which will put to rest the heated debates and make it possible to calmly teach the true astronomy in private and in public (p. 52).While there were some favourable reactions to theCopernicus triumphans, others called its demonstration of the parallax into doubt. It was soon overshadowed by the aberration of the fixed stars put forward by James Bradley in 1728.",Moesgaard 1972,"Horrebow, Peder‎(← links)","Horrebow, Peder:Copernicus triumphans, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Copernicus_triumphans(last revision: 16.11.2021).","While Horrebow implies that the ""Tusculan observations"" are only included in part, he affirms in the next sentence that he does not present a selection of good observations but a lot of data which lead to the same conclusion.p. 33:Quid enim opus est persuasione, ubi geometrica adest demonstratio?",JL,Yes,IT,

Any errors or obscurities found in this work were dealt with by way of commentary (see, e.g., theOpusculum spericum cum commento et figurisand theSphaera in usum scholarum). By contrast, the presentDiscription of the World in Four Booksby the gifted Venetian mathematician Francesco Barozzi pursues higher ambitions, as explained on the first ten pages of the unpaginated preface to the reader: While most parts of astronomy are set out satisfyingly in a great number of publications, Barozzi says, for cosmology (the part of astronomy which elucidates the structure of the universe in general), one has Ptolemy's comprehensive and demandingAlmagest, but no good concise treatment. Even Sacrobosco's work, the best and most popular introduction, is full of errors. Barozzi wants to fill this gap and to create a reliable standard work for beginners. He leaves it open whether he only thinks of autodidacts or of classroom students as well, but it seems safe to assume that he would have been pleased to see his work used in formal academic teaching instead of Sacrobosco'sSphaera. However, there is no indication that this actually happened.Roughly one third of the book's 520 quarto pages are taken up by paratexts: The title page is followed by a dedication to Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, and an epigram in praise of the author and his work. A Ramist table details the subdisciplines ofastronomia sive astrologia, providing an interesting insight into the early modern understanding of the field and its inner structure. The extensive preface to the reader justifies Barozzi's above-mentioned ambitions through a succinctbibliografia ragionataof the field (see above) and a list of 84 factual and didactic errors of Sacrobosco and his followers. (This led to an animated discussionper litteraswithChristoph Claviuswho had himself written a commentaryIn Sphaeram Ioannis de Sacrobosco; cf.DBI 6 (1964) 495–99). Next, Barozzi introduces the mathematical foundations of astronomy, including a series of axioms on spherical geometry from Theodosius of Bithynia'sSphaerica. After a table of contents, the printer announces that an Italian edition is going to follow soon and provides a list of errata. – At the end of the book, the reader finds an index filling 30 pages and comprising c. 1500 entries.In imitation of the work Barozzi wants to replace, the body of his text is structured in four books, which are subdivided into two, three, three and five chapters respectively. The latter are further subdivided into unnumbered sections. Book 1 gives an overview of the universe and the different spheres. Book 2 describes the various circles dividing heaven and earth, the five zones defined by the tropics and the polar circles, and the winds. Book 3 deals with the risings and settings of the stars, the variation of day length and theclimata(subdivisions of the zones within which the duration of the longest day varies by no more than 15 minutes). Book 4 discusses the planets and concludes with an account of eclipses.Barozzi does his best to make his work readily understandable. His Latin is cultivated and his syntax classical, but his periods are neither very complex nor overlong. Throughout his account, he keeps announcing beforehand what he is going to discuss next. At the very beginning, the contents or the entire work, already presented a few pages before in the table of contents, are repeated and clarified in full sentences (pp. 1–2). Even short sections are announced by formulae such asConsequens autem est, ut ostendamus, quomodo moveatur(""My next concern is to show how [wind] is set in motion"", p. 102). In general, the text's structure and train of thought are made explicit to a high degree. In addition, copious marginalia as well as tables, sketches and diagrams provide orientation and clarify difficult aspects. Dissent within the astronomical tradition is not passed over in silence, but the reader is never left in doubt where Barozzi thinks the truth to rests (e.g. p. 231 on the planetary orbits).Although Barozzi did not manage to replace Sacrobosco, his book was reasonably successful. A second and a third edition were published in Venice in 1598 and 1607 respectively.

Finally, before the first dialogue begins, a series of fundamental astronomical figures (for example, the length of the year; the apparent diameters of the planets) is presented in tables and charts in order to help the reader's understanding of what follows.The two interlocutors are called Antimachus (""He Who Fights Against"") and Nicomedes (""Whose Mind is Victorious""). The former is a down-to-earth lawyer with a lively interest in scientific questions. Smart and curious, he chiefly trusts his senses and is not easily convinced of anything. Nicomedes, by contrast, is a professional mathematician and astronomer, a bit quixotic and somewhat prone to melancholy. He clearly is an author-figure, while Antimachus' many questions and objections seem to anticipate possible difficulties and doubts of the reader. Despite their different characters, the two men are depicted as being good friends.The three dialogues, which comprise over 200 quarto pages between them, are set in Messina and its surroundings. The dramatic date is 1535, but some days or weeks elapse between the single dialogues. In the first dialogue, the interlocutors meet in the countryside during the summer of 1535. When they return home in the evening, word of Charles V's conquest of Tunis has just arrived. In the second dialogue, the Tunis campaign is over. The two interlocutors meet at a church of Saint Mary; they interrupt their conversation, which is thereby divided into two sections, for lunch. The last dialogue takes place near a Carmelite monastery; Nicomedes should have given an astronomical lecture there, but the listeners have not shown up.In terms of content, the first dialogue is dedicated to the universe as a whole, its spheres and elements. The second discusses the sphere of the fixed stars and its movement, the zodiac, the zones and the winds in its first part; after lunch, the conversation turns on longitudes, latitudes, declensions, ascensions, lengths of days and nights and climates. The final dialogue treats observational astronomy. As intimated in the letter of dedication (fol. a i v – a ii r), all three dialogues together are intended as an introduction to cosmology and astronomy and as a propaedeutics to Ptolemy'sAlmagest.Maurolico is not only a good mathematician and astronomer, but a gifted writer as well.
Through the many questions posed and objections raised by Antimachus, he manages to create the impression of an animated real-life conversation (at least in the first two dialogues; in the last one, this format is mysteriously abandoned in favour of a didactic monologue by Nicomedes without a single word from Antimachus). Moreover, the setting is depicted and the conversation framed with considerable care, as in the charming opening of the first dialogue (fol. 1r): Antimachus is retreating from the busy city to the countryside, soliloquising on the pleasures of country life. Suddenly, he is interrupted by the sight of Nicomedes sitting by the road, absorbed by melancholic thoughts and holding a sphere or an astrolabe, and approaches him.The challenge of conveying the technical contents of mathematical astronomy in the form of a casual, relaxed conversation is met, besides the aforementioned charts preceding the dialogues, with the help of marginalia and a considerable number of diagrams. The resulting breach of the dramatic illusion is in most cases silently accepted. Once at least, however, such a device is integrated into the dialogue itself, as Nicomedes has a table of the right and oblique ascensions of the zodiacal signs with him and shows it to Antimachus (fol. 50r).","Paulus 2005, 241–252Cioffarelli 2014","Maurolico, Francesco‎(← links)","Maurolico, Francesco:Cosmographia in tres dialogos distincta, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Cosmographia_in_tres_dialogos_distincta(last revision: 28.07.2022).","letter of dedication, a ii r, on errors of transmission in Greek mathematicians and their accordingly erroneous modern editions:adeo numerorum characteres et geometrica lineamenta erroribus obnoxia sunt.",MK,Yes,MK,

The short letter of dedication calls the title quite unusual (insueto fere titulo). In fact, the work thus designated is novel as well.After an extensive index rerum and a short treatise on the behaviour of doctors and critical days (pp. 1–54), the author presents one hundred medical case histories in which he has been personally involved (pp. 55–391). Most of them are divided into two sections, thecuratioproper and thescholia(learned annotations), although the latter is occasionally missing. Thecuratiois a first person narrative, written in a lively and plain style and proceeding chronologically from the onset of the disease to the convalescence (as Amatus is invariably successful). The disease process and the medical measures taken are described in considerable detail, including many recipes of the medication prescribed. Thescholia, typographically distinguished from thecuratioby italic font, provide a learned commentary on select aspects.  In the first case history (pp. 55–61), which discusses the cure of a girl bitten by a viper, thescholiafocus on the nature of this kind of snake and on the inferior quality of the Latin translations of Avicenna'sCanon. In this part, Amatus generously quotes from the learned medical tradition, but not to the exclusion of his personal experience. One comes to know, for instance, that he kept a pregnant viper in a box to learn how the animal gives birth, or that he tried in vain to convince a certain Iacobus Mantinus to translate the entireCanon(pp. 59; 60–61). Nonetheless, the dichotomy of case history on the one hand and learned commentary on the other, two aspects which were usually blended in earlier writings of this type, remains striking. It puts Amatus' practical work as a doctor on an equal footing with the age-old learned tradition and insinuates that his efforts are worthy of the same exegetical attention as a classical medical text.This novel approach obviously appealed to Amatus' readers. It is perhaps no coincidence that the present copy is diligently annotated from beginning to end (usually, the annotatory zeal of early modern readers of scientific literature slackens after a few dozen pages). Until 1566, Amatus could publish six moreCurationum centuriaein the same style as the present one.

Structured as a dialogue between three protagonists, Eudoxus, Brutus and Philiatrus (a form that fits the work's controversial content, as Fernel remarks at the end of his preface to Henry II of France), the text is a counterpart to Fernel's other significant contribution to Renaissance medicine, theDe naturali parte medicinae(1542). In contrast to the latter, which deals mostly with practical medicine, theDe abditis rerum causisprovides a philosophical dimension of medical knowledge. The central element of Fernel's interpretation of the divine and occult forces of all forms becomes a Neoplatonic reading of Galen's medical works, which allows Fernel to combine medicine with contemporary interest in Plotinus' and other Neoplatonists' theory oflogoi spermatikoi.Fernel continued to develop his text after the first publication of 1548. The second, slightly revised edition ofDe abditis rerum causisappeared in Paris in 1551.

"Metz, Andreas","De indole rationis quantitatum compositae indeque manante adaequata exponentis notione commentatio academica eaque philosophico-mathematica, quam edidit Dr. Andreas Metz, philosophiae in Universitate Wirceburgensi professore publico ordinario",,1820,Würzburg,Nitribitt,After 1800,Monograph,Mathematics,De adaequata exponentis notione(Google Books)Alternative link:MDZ,902259,"In this short monograph, Andreas Metz, mathematician and professor of philosophy at the University of Würzburg, intends to make a contribution to a philosophically satisfying definition of powers of numbers. As he explains in his preface, the common understanding of potentiation as multiplying a number with itself as many times as indicated by the exponent makes it impossible to understand potentiation by zero, negative numbers, and fractions. In order to mend this deficit, Metz bases the notion of potentiation on the concept ofratio(""ratio""). The book's goal, summarily indicated in its full title (Academic, Philosophical-Mathematical Treatise on the Nature of the Composite Ratio of Quantities and the Correct Notion of the Exponent Arising from It), is explained quite elaborately in the preface (pp. I–X). Moreover, the preface also contains an explanation of why Metz writes in Latin: it is possible, he claims, to speak about mathematical topics as clearly in this as in any other language; university students have spent many years learning Latin and should get the possibility to practice it; and – an idea indicative of the political atmosphere of the Vormärz – Latin guarantees academic liberty because it enables a safe discussion of delicate ideas which could do harm if the rabble would learn about them (pp. VIII–X).The main text comprises 23 paragraphs and a finalscholiumon 44 octavo pages. Many paragraphs are titleddefinitio,theorema, orcorollarium. The first half of the text (§§1–12) is devoted to the notion of a mathematicalratio, including the crucial type of theratio composita(§4), that is, a ratio not simply expressed asa:bbut by means of several intermediary quantities, for instancea:x, x:y, y:z, z:b. 'Addition' of theserationesis defined as their composition: '(a:b)+(b:c)=(a:c)' and generalized to addition of arbitrary ratios. This serves as a basis for the definition of 'multiplication' of ratios which is a repeated addition; like the common operations thus called, also those introduced with respect torationeshave neutral and inverse elements (§§11–12). From §13, Metz goes on to show how the meaning of exponents in powers can be explained logically and consistently on the basis of his notion ofrationes. For instance,n0=1can be derived via n0=nm–m, interpreting the last expression as a combination (addition) of the tworationes1:nmandnm:1=-(1:nm), which yields theratio1:1 (§21). Metz seems to be particularly proud of this derivation, for which he expressly claims novelty: it is found neither in Johann Friedrich Lorenz'Grundlehren der allgemeinen Größenberechnung(1800, several later editions) nor in Abraham Gotthelf Kästner'sDe translatis in dictione geometrarum(1763), two works from which Metz quotes at length (pp. 36–38). Thescholium finale(pp. 40–44) contains some reflections on the relation of mathematics and philosophy in general. That this is a topic dear to the author's heart is also shown, apart from the work's title and fundamental concern, by a passage like the discussion of mathematical and philosophicalrationesin §2, where Metz takes issue with Kant.Ironically, Metz's ambition to introduce powers by a single unified definition yielded the same cases as he had criticised before - only well hidden in a completely analogous (but less elucidating) mathematical machinery. In both cases, exponents which are natural numbers are defined by repeated multiplication or repeated composition of ratios, respectively. And in both cases, the definitions of negative and fractional exponents is a direct result of a sensible continuation of the rules for reckoning with powers or ratios, respectively. In this light, Metz's ""novel"" explanation thatn0=1is in fact the exact same reasoning why mathematicians found this definition useful already before 1700: Asnm:nm=1andnm:nm=nm-m=n0by the division rules for powers, it is sensible to definen0=1. The ""negative"" ratio from above is in fact the analogous concept of a reciprocal and thus corresponds with negative exponents - nothing new in a time where imaginary and even complex numbers were used byEuler, Cauchy and others. Incidentally, a unified definition was already given by Euler in hisIntroductio in analysin infinitorumwhere general powers are represented by an infinite series (§124).Metz's philosophical aspirations may be partly responsible for the character of his Latin, which is grammatically correct but can be convoluted. When he wants to express that the common notion of the exponent is unfit to make the different kinds of exponents and their use in potentiation understandable, the result is the following boa-constrictor sentence (p. III):Sed dictam vulgarem exponentis definitionem legi logicae definitionis prohibenti, ne definitio angustior sit definito, non satisfacere aeque facile perspectu est ac theorematum dictorum demonstrationes dictas pariter vulgares eo comparates non esse, ut intellectum eumque imprimis iuvenilem doceant, qui ex nativa exponentium, de quibus in iis sermo est, potestate atque vi fiat, ut ea vera agnoscantur eorumque concipiendorum ansam mens humana habuerit et adhucdum habeat.The mathematical vocabulary is as a rule close to the modern one and shows the same high level of technicality. When two quantities relate to one another like the m-th powers of two other quantities, their ratio is called aratio sub m plicata(p. 30). Moreover, Metz uses a number of apparently idiosyncratic expressions: the vernacularzerois latinized aszerus(p. III);tota, which means ""whole"" in standard Latin, is used, in combination withpars(""part""), as correlative toquotain the meaning ""the so-manieth [part]"" (p. 17); from an earlier work, the designationratio simplifor a ratio of the typea:ais taken over (p. 30).",,,"Metz, Andreas:De adaequata exponentis notione, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_adaequata_exponentis_notione(last revision: 06.02.2022).","Thanks to Will for donating the book to the project.cd/ab est nomen rationis ab:cd (p. 24); zerus = 0 (e.g. p. 25); n:n as neutral element in ratios (§11, p. 25); in the following §, the inverse element is introduced (always with comparison to addition/subtraction)§13, pp. 26–7: transitus ad potentiasstrange words: p. 30ratio simpli, dupli etc.;totaas correlative toquota§17 transitus ad exponentes; hinc inde exp. pos., neg., etc. definiuntur§21 meaning of zeroth power explained; pp. 36-8 claim of novelty made for this with two long quotes.

However, the work was almost outdated by the achievements of Newton and Leibniz when it appeared posthumously in 1679. Fermat most likely wrote the manuscript in critical response toWallis'sArithmetica infinitorumand the title is probably a reference toViète'sDe aequationum recognitione et emendatione(Mahoney 1994, 254).De aequationum localiumfalls in two parts which differ considerably in mathematical style and methods. The first describes how to integrate higher-order parabolas and hyperbolas by a method Fermat had developed up to 1646. He used a sophisticated subdivision of the axis in form of a geometric sequence which allowed for a determination of an approximate area by means of a geometric series. Fermat calls thisnostram methodum logarithmicam, a notion which he does not explain any further. Considering the differences of the geometric sequencealmost zero, or, as he calls itadequalto zero, he receives the exact value for the quadrature. There he employs Diophantus of Alexandria's notion ofadequality, of ""almost equality"", a heuristic which Fermat often used successfully (seeMethodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam). This is however well hidden behind a Greek-style presentation using diagrams and proportions of lines and areas.In thesecond part, Fermat systematically investigates a large class of curves whose quadrature is reduced to the cases of the first part. There his mathematical presentation changes radically - curves are not given anymore by theirsymptoma(that is, by ratios of lines or their powers) but by their curve equation, theiraequatio localiummentioned in the title. Fermat used the newly invented analytical geometry, a tool which was not yet available when he wrote the first part.In both parts the language is very technical (a good example can be found onpp. 46–47). The mathematical notation (especially in the second part) is based on the wayFrançois Viètedenoted algebraic expressions. On the last pages, one can find the modern way of writing powers of the unknown. For instance, Fermat used ""A6"" instead of the previously preferred notationA cub. cub.for the sixth power of the unknown.Although the treatise contains several original ideas, it did not shape the development of analysis considerably. On the one hand, this is due to the achievements ofLeibnizandNewtonwhich were published soon after. On the other hand - as smart the ideas by Fermat were - they steered away from the important duality of integration and and differentiation and thus could not shed more light on the theoretical relations of the subject.","Mahoney 1994, 244–267","Fermat, Pierre de‎(← links)Arithmetica infinitorum‎(← links)De aequationum recognitione et emendatione‎(← links)","Fermat, Pierre de:De aequationum localium transmutatione et emendatione, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_aequationum_localium_transmutatione_et_emendatione(last revision: 26.01.2022).",,FB,Yes,FB,

Its existence was already mentioned in a 1593 tract. It contains the relation between finding roots of algebraic equations and middle proportionals. Also, in chapter VI one finds atrigonometrical solutionof a cubic equation which uses the triple-angle formula for the cosine (basis) because it contains a third power. The main body however is dedicated to transformations of equations to equivalent ones, first by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division of terms on both sides, then by the substitution of variables. As Viète accepts only positive quantities, this results in many pages of different cases, structured as theorems.The second tract in this volume is calledDe emendatione aequationum tractatus secundusand treats various techniques to simplify algebraic equations. They are given names likeexpurgatio per uncias(removal of the second highest order term by a certain substitution),transmutatio proton eschatonandisomeria(simple but useful substitutions),anastrophe,symmetrica climactismusandclimactica paraperosis(other technical transformations). A whole chapter is dedicated to each of these techniques which are prominently featured in the title together with their goal, for instance, in to remove fractions (adversus vicium fractionis) or negative terms (adversus vicium negationis).In the 14th chapter one finds Viète's probably most famous result which is now known as Vieta's formulas. Their main statement is that the coefficients of algebraic equations can be constructed by the roots (solutions) of the equation.In 1646, the work experienced a second edition inFrancisci Vietate opera mathematica, whose notation differs slightly from the first print. For example, numbers in formulas are consequently written as numerals, and instead of curly brackets for grouping terms (which are moreover stacked), a bar reaching over the respective terms indicates their belongig together. This saves a significant amount of space on the pages. Also, the commonly known radical sign is used there, whereas in the first edition taking roots is abbreviated by ""l."" which probably meanslongitudoorlatitudo.The work was very influental in the development of algebra due to its vast amount of techniques for manipulating equations, but even more because of the explicitly stated relation of roots and coefficients of algebraic equations. This was certainly acknowledged byFermatwhen he called one of his own treatisesDe aequationum localium transmutatione et emendationeto place it in the tradition of Viète's work.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 14, 18–25Oaks 2018van der Waerden 1980, 65–67","De occulta parte numerorum‎(← links)In artem analyticem isagoge‎(← links)Viète, François‎(← links)De aequationum localium transmutatione et emendatione‎(← links)","Viète, François:De aequationum recognitione et emendatione, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_aequationum_recognitione_et_emendatione(last revision: 02.12.2021).",,,Yes,FB,

Joseph Juste Scaliger had devoted half of his scholarly life to the study of ancient chronology publishing seminal works asDe emendatione temporumorThesaurus temporum. This endeavour also involved him in astronomy, a discipline of which he gained a good overall understanding without ever fully mastering its technical side. Towards the end of his life, a misguided astronomical idea took hold of Scaliger. Since antiquity, astronomers had observed that the equinoxes, the two intersections of the ecliptic and the celestial equator, seemed slowly to wander westward over the years and that the celestial north pole changed its position accordingly. Today, we know that this so-called precession is due to a gyroscopic movement of the earth axis which describes a full circle in c. 26,000 years. From antiquity to early modern times, in contrast, the phenomenon was ascribed to an eastward movement of the sphere of the fixed stars. From his study and interpretation of ancient sources, Scaliger convinced himself that there was no such movement of thesphaera octava. Rather, the equinoxes themselves were really moving to the west. From a modern point of view, Scaliger's opinion and thecommunis opinioopposed by him are equally wrong, but within a pre-Copernican framework, the latter made good sense, whereas Scaliger was forced to deny the obvious fact that the celestial north pole had shifted over time. Professional astronomers such asTycho Brahewith whom he shared his thoughts tried to point out his errors to him, but in vain. Finally, Scaliger laid down his argument in the present work, theExercise about the Precession of the Equinoxes. However, he did not publish it in his lifetime. It was edited posthumously by Jan Rutgers, one of his devoted disciples. Rutgers introduces the book by an affectionate letter of dedication to his friend Pierre Dupuy, in which he calls Scaliger the greatest man who ever lived (… quo sol an maiorem visurus sit, vehementer dubito, non vidisse affirmare possum).Scaliger's treatise falls into four chapters, as he clearly and precisely indicates at the end of his short introduction (pp. 1–3): ""In the first chapter [pp. 3–22], I will describe the history of the observation of the stars from its very origin.

The single chapters, especially the last one, contain many separate subsections labeledscholiaandcorollariaas well as star catalogues, lists of alleged absurdities in the astronomic tradition and the like. An extract from a letter to a friend, written in 1604, is appended to the treatise itself (pp. 91–96).Scaliger's book has an extremely learned look. Its pages bristle with (untranslated) Greek quotations, astronomical symbols, mathematical figures and diagrams. Scaliger clearly wants to appear as a great critic (which he was) and a technically accomplished astronomer (which he was not) at the same time, so that he can attack his adversaries from a strong position. These adversaries are the professional mathematicians and astronomers of his time. Scaliger reproach to them is that they neglect the literary tradition and the history of their discipline.Denique mathematicarum rerum aut originum imperitiores haud temere alios reperias quam eos qui mathematici audire volunt(""Finally, you could hardly find people less acquainted with the history or origin of mathematics than those who want to be called 'mathematicians'""), as he puts it in the introduction (p. 2). Their historical and philological blindness is the reason why they entangle themselves in absurdities. They will not even listen to good advice from an expert such as Scaliger himself. Consequently, the book is peppered with utterances of righteous indignation such asimprudentes et iudicii expertes(""inconsiderate people devoid of judgement"", p. 2),anilis et nugatoria est opinio(""this is a nonsensical opinion worthy of old hags"", p. 31),quod est absurdissimum(""this the height of absurdity"", p. 33),delirat(""he is delusional"", p. 64) orhomines, quibus falsa videntur omnia, quaecumque ignorant ipsi(""people who think everything wrong which is unknown to themselves"", p. 80). The account concludes with yet another broadside against the astronomers and a plea to the reader to join Scaliger's side:Sed iam tempus est stellas in suis sedibus relinquere et mathematicis, qui nobis adeo iniqui fuerunt, meliorem mentem precari. Tu, bone lector, fruere et nostrum laborem, si quid in te humanitatis est, boni consule(""But now it is time to leave the stars in their places and to pray that the astronomers, who have been so unjust towards me, may become more reasonable. You, good reader, enjoy and be well-disposed towards my work, if there is any human feeling in you"", p. 91).The plea was unsuccessful, partly because most readers who dared to tackle this difficult book presumably weremathematicithemselves. The rejection of Scaliger's thesis seems to have been unanimous, starting fromKepler'sNotae ad Scaligeri diatribam de aequinoctiis. The most extensive refutation apparently wasGiovanni Antonio Magini'sConfutatio diatribae Scaligeri de aequinoctiorum praecessione(1617).","Grafton 1983–1993, vol. 2, 459–88","Scaliger, Joseph Juste‎(← links)Confutatio diatribae Scaligeri de aequinoctiorum praecessione‎(← links)","Scaliger, Joseph Juste:De aequinoctiorum anticipatione diatriba, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_aequinoctiorum_anticipatione_diatriba(last revision: 13.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In the introduction addressed to his friend Angelo Gabriele, Pietro praises his teacher Lascaris without mentioning his name. He also claims that he was asked a lot about Messina after his return, its surroundings and, most importantly, Mount Etna. He therefore decided to compose the dialogue to respond to all those who were interested in the subject.The introductory address to Gabriele seamlessly leads into a conversation between Pietro and his father Bernardo at their villa in Santa Maria di Non, in the Paduan region. With numerous references to ancient sources in which Etna was pictured, Bembo tells his father about his experience of climbing the mountain and describes in detail its nature and features. The roles are thus distributed between the two participants in a somewhat surprising way. In a normal dialogue between father and son, one would expect the father to take the leading role. Here, in contrast, it is the son who has new things to tell, while the father is curious to listen and to learn. At the end, the father has much to reflect about:cogitabundus in bibliothecam perrexit(""he thoughtfully went on into his library""). That probably is a reaction which Bembo would have appreciated in his readers as well.In accordance with Bembo's theoretical convictions, the work is composed in strictly classical, Ciceronian Latin. Its style is matched by the Antiqua type of theeditio princeps, which was created for Manutius by Francesco Griffo.

However, the separate pagination, a title page of its own, a letter of dedication (to cardinal Girolamo Casanate) and a letter to the reader in the Roman edition imply thatOn the Body Structure of the Tarantula, Its Bite and Its Consequenceswas originally also published as a self-contained booklet.The work comprises 60 pages and 13 chapters. A brief introduction classifies the tarantula as a spider with eight eyes (as opposed to spiders with two eyes) and speculates that a discussion of its venom may shed light on the question of animal venoms in general (ch. 1). After that, the tarantula's habitat, hot Apulia, is described (ch. 2). The animal's anatomical characteristics are laid out in some detail, partly on the basis of microscopical observations (chs. 3–4; the description refers to an impressive copper engraving inserted after the letter to the reader, which shows two big tarantulas crawling over a map of Apulia). This is followed by an account of the tarantula's bite and of the severe symptoms ensuing (chs. 5–7). Alongside normal medical treatments, listening to music and above all intense dancing for hours and days are of paramount importance. Luckily, the patients are automatically driven to this behaviour (chs. 8–10). Ch. 11 comprises eight case histories, the last of which is noteworthy as being a self-experiment made by a Neapolitan doctor (pp. 49–50; that the tarantula's bite turned out to be comparatively innocuous in this case is taken as proof that the poison is fully efficient only in Apulia). Baglivi concludes with some tentative thoughts about the nature of the venom (ch. 12) and on the curative power of music, which he supposes to be due to the physical movement caused in the body by the sound waves (ch. 13).Despite some short digressions (e.g. on the spawn of oysters, pp. 19–20), the work remains closely focussed on its exotic topic and can be called an archetypical monograph. Baglivi writes a clear, elegant Latin and is at pains to separate his observations from his interpretations, which he repetedly marks as tentative in accordance with the thrust of the bigger work to which his tarantula treatise is appended. Ironically, the observational evidence which he (and his contemporaries) believed to be incontrovertible  must in fact have been deeply flawed: tarantulas are no more poisonous than bees, their venom works in the same way within and outside Apulia and dancing is no valid cure. On the basis of this modern knowledge, the connection itself made in early modern times between the tarantula, Apulia, music and compulsive dancing has turned into a mystery. In this context, the combination of information from the realms of biology, medicine, cultural history and folklore offered by Baglivi may still prove worthy of attention.",,"Baglivi, Giorgio‎(← links)Phonurgia nova‎(← links)De effectibus musices in corpus animatum‎(← links)","Baglivi, Giorgio:De anatome, morsu et effectibus tarantulae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_anatome,_morsu_et_effectibus_tarantulae(last revision: 17.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In this period, Padua was a renowned centre of anatomical studies, and Johnston seems to have attended at least one dissection there, as his poetry includes two epigramsOn an Anatomical Dissection Displayed in Padua by Giulio Casseri of Piacenza. When Johnston was in Padua, Giulio Casseri was professor of surgery and privately taught anatomy. Johnston's epigrams on his dissection appear as a pair in hisEpigrammataof 1632. In the following years, they were reprinted in theDeliciae poetarum Scotorumof 1637, an anthology of Scottish Neo-Latin poetry which Johnston edited, and in hisPoemata omniaof 1642 (there are generally accessible digital copies of the two latter books, but not of theEpigrammata). Apart from a few orthographical variants, the text of the poems is the same in all three printed volumes.The first epigram consists of seven elegiac couplets. It opens with a pointed contrast between the ancient amphitheatre as a place of spectacle for common people, and the anatomical theatre as a place of spectacle for students of medicine:Amphitheatralem miretur vulgus arenam,quemque movent elephas, bos, leo, tigris, aper.Qui Phoebum, quem Phoebus amat, spectacula, Caesar,muneribus praefert Casseriana tuis.""The common people shall marvel at the arena of the amphitheatre, and whoever gets excited over an elephant, a bull, lion, tiger or boar. Who loves Apollo and is loved by Apollo, Caesar, prefers Casseri's spectacles to your gifts.""The middle part of the poem then reflects on the dissection that takes place in the anatomical theatre. The participant sees the many wonders of the microcosm and recognises God in them. While the dissecting hand lays bare the structure of the human body, the greatest work of nature, the anatomist provides explanations:Lingua comes dextram sequitur, Natura loquentem / auscultat, leges discit et ipsa suas(""The tongue follows the hand as a companion, and Nature listens to the one who talks and learns about her own laws herself""). The poem ends with the claim that anyone who does not marvel at the spectacles of the Paduan theatre either has no eyes and ears or is an idiot.An interesting aspect of this epigram is the way in which antiquity serves as backdrop to praise Paduan anatomy and the anatomist Casseri. The poet'spersonabegins by addressing Julius Caesar, who financed games in the amphitheater as entertainment of the masses, and pointedly contrasts him with his early-modern namesake Casseri, who offers spectacles of a different kind to the learned elite. At the same time, the early-modern anatomy in Padua is tied back to antiquity: Casseri's students are characterised through their relationship to Phoebus Apollo, the ancient god of medicine, and the anatomical theatre is described asAntenoreum theatrum, relating it to Antenor, the mythical founder of Padua (cf. Livy,Ab urbe condita1.1).The second epigram consists of three elegiac couplets. It praises the people whose bodies were dissected asfelices animae(""happy souls"", cf. Ovid,Fasti1.297) and promises eternal fame to them, as they become part of Casseri’s immortal publication. However, if they wanted to live mortal lives instead, they should decend from heaven, as the hands who dissected their bodies will restore them to life. This is a marked difference to Caspar Barlaeus'spoem on the anatomical theatre of Amsterdam, where the dissected bodies of criminals serve as a warning to the audience to lead a virtuous life.","Geddes 1895, 59–60 (contains both epigrams with English paraphrase and commentary)Crawford 2006, 106–107 (contains the second epigram with English translation)",,"Johnston, Arthur:De anatomica sectione Patavii exhibita, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_anatomica_sectione_Patavii_exhibita(last revision: 26.01.2022).",The pentameterInque tuo vultum cernis et ora Deishould probably readinque tuo vultu etc..There is an unpublished dissertation (2014) on Johnston's poetry during his stay in Europe:Arthur Johnston and the fostering of Scottish letters,,Yes,IT,

The translation was posthumously seen through the press by his friend Ludovico Podocataro in 1476 and virtually monopolized the field of Aristotelian zoology. Gaza’s thorough knowledge of classical Latin sources, his collation of several good Greek manuscripts, and his efforts to make the text as clear as possible, which often implied bold emendations and explanatory interpolations, ensured the success of his translation. Another advantageous aspect of Gaza's work was its elegant Latin style (analyzed byPerfetti 1995who showed that Gaza aptly rendered different stylistic registers of the Greek original but also overloaded the text with rhetoricalornatus).The translation was printed forty-two times until the end of the sixteenth century and even influenced theconstitutio textusof the Greek text editions.

It is dedicated to cardinal Castillionaeus. In about 500 pages divided into two books, Belon discusses many different animal species.The work is opened with a letter to the reader by the publisher Charles Estiennes (Carolus Stephanus) praising the author, the content, and especially the beautiful images of the work. This letter is followed by a dedicatory letter to cardinal Castillionaeus by the author himself. In it, Belon highlights that he relies mostly on personal observation and stresses that he has depicted the animals as he has seen them. This leads, for example, to Belon’s criticizing of ancient depictions of dolphins with a curvated back (p. 11) and also of the fabulous “Neptunius equus”, a wondrous animal with the front part of a horse and a fishtail (p. 11f.). He also describes and depicts (p. 38f.), however, the so-called “sea monk” (monachus piscis), a fabulous animal that features in many natural histories on fish. He refers to Norwegian eyewitnesses in this case.
After the dedicatory letter follows a table of content and a detailed index of ancient and modern fish names in Latin, Greek, Italian and French. Synonyms for the different species are given throughout the work – if not systematically – not only in these languages but also in English, German as well as some local dialects, for instance, those of Genova and Marseille.
Chapter one describes the structure of the work. The first book discusses animals “with blood” (i.e. with red blood that can be found mostly in vertebrates), the second “bloodless” animals like insects, molluscs, crustaceans, etc. Within the books the order is less systematic and strict but there is a tendency from bigger to smaller and from more “complex” to less “complex”. Moreover, Belon takes properties like reproduction (viviparous, oviparous), form, skeleton (e.g. cartilage, bone), and habitat into account. This leads for example to the fact that the ichneumon is described in the chapter on oviparous animals because Belon obviously wants to have it next to the crocodile. 
Belon also discusses terminology of fish in the first chapter and explains where their names come from (e.g. habitat, properties, form, comparisons to birds, land animals, plants, organs, instruments, etc.).
There are many detailed woodcuts not only of the outer form of the species but, for example, also of a uterus with foetus of a dolphin (p. 13), an orca giving birth (p. 18), shark eggs (p. 68) as well as of ancient sculptures (p. 23) and coins (p. 11). Belon is well aware of ancient authorities and cites, for example, Aristotle and Pliny in his first chapter and often quotes from a Latin translation of Oppian’sHalieutica. He uses ancient accounts on certain animals and discusses whether the animal described there could be identified with his modern findings which is often a problem of terminology (e.g. if Strabo’s ὄρυγξ is the orca on p. 16f.)
The text is written in clear and quite easy Latin.","Gudger 1934, 26–28Bäumer 1991–1996, vol. 2, 351–60","Belon, Pierre‎(← links)Aquatilium historia‎(← links)","Belon, Pierre:De aquatilibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_aquatilibus(last revision: 16.06.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

The title, which promisesDemocritus of Abdera's Great Art or On Natural Things, together with the Commentaries on it by Synesius, Pelagius, Stephanus of Alexandria, Michael Psellus, Translated by Domenico Pizzimenti, is misleading in two ways. On the one hand, the first work contained in the volume is indeed (an acephalous version of) a treatise wrongly ascribed to Democritus since antiquity; however, that work was not calledDe arte magna(or Περὶ μεγάλης τέχνης), but Φυσικὰ καὶ μυστικὰ (Things Natural and Mystical), and this is also more or less how it is titled on the first page of the translation proper (fol. 5v):Ex rebus naturalibus et mysticis Democriti. On the other hand, the further works contained in the volume are not commentaries on Φυσικὰ καὶ μυστικά, not even in the early modern, very wide sense of that word, but self-contained treatises. What motivated the author and/or the publisher to misrepresent the book's content in this way remains unclear.The translation is in general quite close to the original. Sometimes, a standard expression is replaced by an alchemical metaphor. Some grammatical errors have crept in. (Both is combined in the genitiveVenerisfor the dative χαλκῷ, fol. 5v). Also the widespread lack of interpunction can obscure the sense. The greatest obstacle to understanding, however, is a host of obscure technical terms such asmarchasita,psimithiumorsandaracha, which are often simply transliterated from the original, because their meaning escapes the translator himself. After all, the Φυσικὰ καὶ μυστικά are a text for the initiated, as shown for instance by the recurrent formula ὡς ἐπινοεῖς /ut scis(""as you know"").The introduction pours scorn on incompetent alchemists and contains a funny anecdote on an alchemical experiment going wrong, leading to an explosion and the permanent disfigurement of the reckless experimenter (fol. 3v). The publication of Democritus' treatise is meant to counter the bad reputation of alchemy caused by such quacks and to restore the previous majesty of the discipline (fol. 4r).

Paris 1813, 254–300)","De arte vitraria(On the Art of Glass) is one of the most popular and vibrant Jesuit didactic poems of the eighteenth century. It was first printed in 1712 in Caen, where the 23-year-old Jesuit Pierre Brumoy was teaching literature and rhetorics. In this first edition, the poem is divided into two books. The first one deals with the nature of glass and with glass-making, the second one presents an array of different glass instruments for science and for fun.The most striking feature of this didactic poem is that it turns the classical mould on its head.De arte vitrariais not a didactic conversation between the teacher-poet and his student-reader with embedded myths, but a mythical narrative with embedded didactic information. The myth (invented by Brumoy) starts when Boreas taunts Vulcan by inventing ice, to which Vulcan retorts by inventing glass. Vulcan then teaches glass-making to the people of Lemnos, his sacred island, but Boreas suddenly returns and smashes Vulcan's glass figurines. After a futile attempt to get help from the goddess of hope, Vulcan has to start over and make new glass. In the second book, Vulcan visits the other gods, who spend their leisure time on Mount Parnassus. He introduces them to glass and challenges them to each design an instrument from the new material. In the course of the ensuing competition, the gods design i.a. a telescope, a microscope, a barometer, an air-pump, a mirror, a prism, an hourglass and spectacles.In contrast to the earnest engagement with science in other eighteenth-century Jesuit didactic poems, the presentation of science and scientific instruments inDe arte vitrariaseems much more playful. Still, especially in the second book, the poem casts spotlights on a number of scientific debates and discoveries apart from the central topic of glass, without however treating them in exhaustive detail. Urania, the designer of the telescope, explains the Copernican system and speculates about the possibility of multiple worlds; Minerva, the designer of the microscope, lectures about generation; the gods observe the famous experiment of placing a bird in the air-pump and subjecting it to the withdrawal of air; Phoebus's invention of the prism is accompanied by a (not-yet Newtonian) explanation of the origin of colours. Interestingly, this last point is ""updated"" in a footnote in the second edition (p. 96), indicating that it was important to the poet and his audience to beau courantwith the latest developments in science.De arte vitrariawas favourably received in Jesuit circles and beyond. In 1741, it saw its second edition as the opening piece of the third volume of Brumoy's collected works, where it was printed with a facing French translation. In the second edition and all later editions, the poem is divided no longer into two, but four books, perhaps in order to match the four books of Vergil'sGeorgics. The third edition of the original Latin text came as late as 1813, when it was included into the second edition of thePoemata didascalica, a Parisian collection of didactic poems. In the meantime, however, the poem had also started to circulate in an Italian translation by the Venetian writer Gasparo Gozzi. Gozzi's translation was first printed in 1775, as a beautifully illustrated wedding gift for a Venetian couple, and later went through several editions as part of Gozzi's collected works.","Haskell 2003, 137–151Masbou 2008Pastore Stocchi 2015","Poemata didascalica‎(← links)Brumoy, Pierre‎(← links)","Brumoy, Pierre:De arte vitraria, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_arte_vitraria(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,IT,Yes,IT,
"Gregorius, de Tipherno","Gregorii Tiphernii, viri clarissimi atque Graecarum litterarum eruditissimi, De astrologia oratio",,,,,15th century since invention of printing,Oration,Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,De astrologia oratio(archive.org),623151,"We do not know at which occasion the Italian humanist Gregorius de Tiferno gave the presentTalk on Astrology(which is how one can translate the title despite the ambiguity of the wordastrologiain early modern times, since astronomical aspects are marginal in the oration). Thesummi philosophiandmaximi astrologiaddressed in the very first sentence point to the opening of a lecture class given at an arts faculty, but if Gregorius ever taught a course on astrology, this seems to have left no other traces. It therefore remains unclear at which point in his teaching career, which between the 1440s and 1460s led him to Naples, Paris and Mantua, the speech could be placed. It apparently is recorded in one15th century manuscriptonly and was not printed before the end of the 19th century.The oration is clearly structured. A proem (pp. 174–75) concludes with apropositio, which enumerates three topics to be discussed: first, the refutation of the reproaches levelled against astrology by its detractors; second, the origin and history of astrology; third, its enjoyableness and usefulnedd. This structure is faithfully executed (pp. 175–77; 177–81; 181–82). A brief peroration (p. 182) sums up the contents and adhorts the audience to the strenuous pursuit of astrology.Conceptually and stylistically, the speech documents the transition from late medieval to humanist academic oratory. Regarding the former, Gregorius strives for logical strictness and exhaustiveness and confronts different standpoints in the manner of a scholastic disputation. He explicates syllogisms such asSed quod sequitur est falsum; ergo et quod antecedit(p. 176; ""But the consequence is false; therefore, the premise is false as well""). In the dispute with the adversaries of astrology, six arguments against the discipline are first enumerated: it negates free will; the influence of innumerable stars is impossible to calculcate; astrological predictions are usually wrong; even everyday phenomena can often not be understood clearly, much less the sky; the exact moment of a person's birth, as needed for a horoscope, is impossible to ascertain; people born at the same time experience different fates and vice versa. After that, these arguments are refuted one after the other and in the very same order (cf. p. 176,nos autem singulis ordine respondeamus). By contrast, the historical section bristles with classical quotations and allusions. The esteem in which astrology was always held is demonstrated by allegorical interpretations of biblical stories and ancient myths (for instance, Endymion was a strenuous observer of the moon, pp. 179–80) and by quotations from Virgil, Horace and Lucan (pp. 180–81). Above all, the syntax and style of the whole speech are marked by a strong classicism. The above-mentioned summary at the end, for instance, starts from a long series ofcumclauses and pointedly concludes with a rhetorical question:Cum itaque stellarum scientia tam late pateat et tantopere sit ab antiquis celebrata et a summis clarissimisque philosophis comprobata ac ratione et experientia confirmata et simul iucundissima sit et utilissima sit, quid causae est, quod eam non omni studio sequi debeamus?(""So since the science of the stars is of such far-reaching importance, was praised so much by the ancients, is confirmed by reason and experience and most pleasurable and most useful at the same time, what reason is there that we should not be obliged to pursue it with full dedication?"")","Müllner 1970, lxxvi–lxxvii, 173–182 (overview of structure and content; edition with short introduction and notes indicating sources and models)","Gregorius, de Tipherno‎(← links)","Gregorius, de Tipherno:De astrologia oratio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_astrologia_oratio(last revision: 16.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,"Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, codex 3190, fol. 42r–50v"

Owing to the fact it had originally been composed to dismiss Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's attack on astrology in theDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem, theDe astronomiae veritatewas later usually combined with another response to Pico, Lucio Bellanti'sContra Picum. Thus, the 1554 Basel edition is characteristic of the ways in which the two works circulated in the sixteenth century and serves as asummaof anti-Piconian treatises.TheDe astronomiae veritateis a dialogue between two interlocutors: Fidelis (interested in astrology but still looking for additional arguments in favour of it) and Astronomia that clarifies the positions Fidelis did not fully understand and argues that astrology is compatible with natural philosophy and religion. The reason behind Pirovano's choice of the genre is unclear, as neither Pico'sDisputationesnor any other text of the astrological polemic of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries adopted the form of a dialogue. In terms of the work's structure, theDe astronomiae veritateconsists of long passages by Astronomia occasionally interrupted by Fidelis that either proposes a new topic for discussion or asks for further clarification of Astronomia's words. Pirovano's stance is largely grounded in the medieval tradition: he defends astrological speculation as a useful tool for theological investigation, on the one hand, and, on the other, contends it has a strong natural philosophical foundation in Aristotelian philosophy, Ptolemy'sTetrabiblosand those who followed them. At the same time, loyal to a variety of medieval authorities, including Raymond Llull, Albert the Great, al-Kindi, Pirovano remains quite sceptical of the new intellectual trends that began to flourish in contemporary Italy, i.e., Neoplatonic philosophy.
The reception of Pirovano's account demonstrates that it was not very successful, unlike Bellanti's which was chronologically the first systematic response to Pico'sDisputationes, and to which all later critics of the count of Mirandola inevitably referred. Nonetheless, it represents an interesting yet relatively neglected contribution to the astrological discussions in Renaissance Italy.","Verardi 2017, 69-80.",,"Pirovano, Gabriele:De astronomiae veritate, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_astronomiae_veritate(last revision: 26.08.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

Martii anno M. DC. XCIII. in alma Fridericiana, cum munus professorium auspicaretur.",,1693,Halle (Saale),Salfeld,17th century,Oration,Medicine,De atheo convincendo ex artificiosissima machinae humanae structura(Digitale Bibliothek Uni Halle),652470,"In March 1693, Friedrich Hoffmann delivered his inaugural oration as professor of medicine and physics at the University of Halle, one year before the newly-founded university officially opened its doors. Hoffmann propagated a modern medicine that explained the human body in mechanical terms (see also hisMedicina rationalis systematica). At the same time, he had ties to the pietist movement (cf.Geyer-Kordesch 2000, 100–103;Trepp 2009, 383). In his orationOn Convincing an Atheist on the Ground of the Most Artful Structure of the Human Machine, Hoffmann brought together these two lines of thought, presenting himself as a champion of both medicine and piety. While he argued in the physico-theological speech that the existence of God was evident from the design of the human being, he also gave an insight into the body's anatomy and mechanical way of functioning.The proem praises the study of nature as a powerful tool to realise and demonstrate the existence of God (fol. A2r–A3v). The human being is then introduced as the topic of the speech (fol. A3v–A4r). Taking into account both the immaterial and the material side (fol. A4r–v), Hoffmann first presents arguments for God's existence on the ground of the human soul (fol. A4v–B2r). But the arguments on the ground of the human body are really at the heart of the work (fol. B2r–C3r), covering i.a. the development in the womb, the circulation of blood and the structure of the eye. At the end, the orator concludes that these observations must convince an atheist of the existence of God (fol. C3r–4r), and closes with thanks to his audience and promises for his tenure as professor (fol. C3r–C4v).When Hoffmann states that he will speaksimplici oratione magisque veritatis quam styli venustatis rationem habendo(""in a speech of simple style, caring more about truth than about beauty of style"", fol. A3r–v), this should probably be interpreted as a gesture of modesty. Far from being artless, the oration exhibits pathos when expressing awe over the structure of the human being and the greatness of God. Rhetorical figures like alliteration, anaphora, tricolon, rhetorical questions and emotional exclamations adorn the text. Hoffmann also employs illustrative comparisons, likening bones to columns (fol. B3v) and the heart to a clock (fol. C1r). The elaborate comparison between the wonder evoked by a splendid city or an artful machine and the wonder evoked by the human body is especially remarkable (fol. B2r–v).The inaugural oration appeared in print the same year it was delivered. The addresses at the beginning and the end show that Hoffmann's audience comprised the chancellor of Brandenburg, the rector of the university, professors, colleagues, patrons, friends and students. Four decades later, a German translation was published in Johann Julius Hecker'sBetrachtung des menschlichen Cörpers(Halle 1734, fol. b1r–d3v). Still a few years later, Hoffmann included the Latin oration in an edition of his collected papers (Opuscula theologico-physico-medica, Halle 1740, pp. 11–28).","Geyer-Kordesch 2000, 100–103Trepp 2009, 442–447",,"Hoffmann, Friedrich:De atheo convincendo ex artificiosissima machinae humanae structura, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_atheo_convincendo_ex_artificiosissima_machinae_humanae_structura(last revision: 16.10.2021).",,,Yes,IT,

They all bear speaking names: Theodorus, a clergyman, represents the author himself (who is in fact addressed as Theodorus in the first poem of praise). As the main speaker, he expounds his theory of theaurum medicum philosophorumat the request of four friends who come to visit him. Of these, Aurelius seems to be interested in gold for economic reasons, Sylvius is a botanist, Palladius interests himself in the technical aspects of alchemy, and Apollonius is a poet who always speaks in verse.Throughout the dialogue, it is emphasized that the kind of alchemy that forms its subject is not a craft concerned with making money, but a pious art aiming at the benefit of mankind and the glory of God. At the very beginning, Theodorus defends his physical and alchemical interests as compatible with his status as a clergyman (pp. 2–4). A little later, Aurelius is chided for his profit-oriented thinking (p. 7). A sharp line is repeatedly drawn between greedy frauds and true adepts of alchemy (e.g. pp. 72–73).The substance to which the whole work is devoted is called, among other things, aspiritus solaris(""spirit of the sun""), abalsamus(""balm"") and asaccharus(""sugar""), although these denominations are clearly metaphorical. It should be thought of not as a mixture of ingredients, but as a kind of essence hidden in gold and various drugs (p. 9). In any case, it is a true panacea (p. 8). Theodorus' discussion of the philosophers' medical gold falls into three parts, as announced at the outset (pp. 5–6). He promises to speak first about its names, its description, powers and material substrate (pp. 6–64); second, about its preparation (pp. 64–78); and finally, about its use in traditional, that is, Galenic medicine (pp. 78–86). (Within these single parts, the train of thought is further clarified by marginalia.) However, despite Theodorus' extensive treatment, which is again and again broadened and specified at the request of his friends, the nature of theaurum medicum philosophorumultimately remains elusive.Also apart from Apollonius' poetic contributions, the conversation is frequently interspersed with verse quotations. This is only one aspect of a high degree of open intertextuality in general. When Theodorus' friends come to visit him, they find him surrounded by a great number of medical books, and throughout the dialogue, references to ancient and modern authors and works from Hippocrates and Virgil (whose lines on the Golden Bough inAeneid6 are invoked repeatedly) to Fernel'sDe abditis rerum causis(p. 74) abound. Horn's own style aims at doing justice to his lofty subject; it is characterised by phrases of praise, superlatives and metaphorical expressions. At times, however, the conversation turns into a somewhat pedestrian catalogue of simples (pp. 40–49, 57–58, 81–84). Nonetheless, Horn evidently harboured literary as well as iatrochemical ambitions in composing the work: in his concluding statement, Theodorus already looks ahead to the conversation's future publication and admonishes its readers to receive it kindly (p. 88).

It is equally motivated by Friedrich Lachmund's intent to promote his collection of natural and archeological curiosities. The aspect of self-advertisement is underlined by the fact that the publication was apparently funded by the author: the imprint just readsapud Andream Frisium, whereas most of this publisher's books are declared to be printedsumptibus Andreae Frisii, ""financed by Andreas Frisius"" (as kindly indicated by Ian Maclean in private conversation).The eponymous ""birds of Diomedes"" are of mythical origin. They were said to be the metamorphosed companions of the Greek hero Diomedes and to inhabit an island off the Apulian cost with a temple of the latter. Already in antiquity, it was unclear how these birds looked like and with which non-mythical birds they should be identified, and this discussion was continued in early modern times. Lachmund owned a taxidermied albatross which he thought to be anavis Diomedea, presumably because he received it under that name and/or because it resembled a description of the latter provided by the famous zoologistUlisse Aldrovandi. (In fact, this is impossible, because no albatrosses live in the Mediterranean.)The preface to the reader explains the work's genesis prompted by the receipt of the bird in question a couple of years ago and by the recognition of the confusion surrounding the identity of theavis Diomedea. Moreover, Lachmund apologises for his copious verbatim quoations from earlier authors and announces the publication of another treatise on thelapis Iudaicus(fossilized sea urchins), which apparently never appeared.The treatise itself is styled as a letter to the German polymath and collector Johannes Daniel Major. Its first part (pp. 7–22) is devoted to the the aforementioned cabinet of curiosities. Lachmund extols many friends who have contributed specimens and underlines the usefulness of such collections in exposing fabulous creatures like the unicorn as such. On pp. 23–45, there follows an extended doxographical overview of the name and identity of the bird in question. Numerous Hebrew, Greek, Latin and early modern texts are quoted and discussed. On pp. 45–51, Lachmund gives his own opinion, based on the specimen in his possession, which is precisely described and also depicted in a number of coppers: theavis Diomedeais not the same as any of the birds with which is has been identified, but stands apart from them (pp. 45–51). Lachmund concludes with a farewell to Major (pp. 51–52). Anindex rerum et verborumrounds off the book.Lachmund's Latin is as a rule clear and easy to understand. The tone is rather panegyrical in the first part. There, the author seems to wander aimlessly from one abstruse topic to the next. In the part dealing with his own bird, he shows himself a keen observer and able describer. The albatross's beak, for instance, is graphically described with the wordsuncus enim alteri ossi non aliter ac unguis digito est annexus(""the crooked part sits on the rest of the beak just like a nail on its finger"", pp. 47–48).Despite its exotic and recondite subject,De ave Diomedeawas re-edited a decade later as an appendix to the first part of an edition ofFrancesco Redi's opuscula (Amsterdam: Wetstein, 1686).",,"Lachmund, Friedrich‎(← links)","Lachmund, Friedrich:De ave Diomedea, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_ave_Diomedea(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

In the lively and engaging form of a conversation, it discusses a specific subject – a special plant, presumably present-day Commiphora Gileadensis, and its products – that could otherwise form the topic of a small treatise.The book is dedicated to the three Venetian supervisors of the University of Padua – presumably not without an ulterior motive, as Alpino apparently wanted a professorship there, which he got two years later. The dedication and the short preface to the reader provide partly overlapping, partly complementary information about the dialogue's origin and purpose: balsam is a wonderful drug, extremely efficient against all kinds of illnesses. In particular, it is an indispensable ingredient of theriac and mithridate. Unfortunately, Italian doctors and pharmacists are hypercritical of balsam imported from the east and declare it to be fake. In contrast, Alpino, who has lived in Egypt for several years, knows that oriental balm is indeed the right stuff. He has written the present book in order to enlighten his contemporaries about the matter.The dialogue is of the dramatic kind, as it lacks any comments or explanations by a narrator. It takes place in a public garden called el-Mattharia near Cairo between three partners, the Egyptian doctor Abdella, a Muslim, the Jewish doctor Abdachim, and Alpino himself. The latter mainly takes the role of the interrogator (although he sometimes shows his medical expertise, cf. e.g. fol. 13r–v), while Abdachim and especially Abdella, who has the greatest knowledge about balm, satisfy his curiosity with extensive explanations. This constellation highlights Alpino's access to sources unavailable to his western contemporaries and thereby underlines his status as an expert in oriental botany and medicine.The conversation (framed by a picture of a balm twig at the beginning and the end) is structured in six chapters. Ch. 1 describes the meeting of the interlocutors and their decision to converse about balm and the shrub from which it stems. In ch. 2, it is agreed that contrary to an often voiced opinion, the shrub is not extinct, and its oriental habitats are localized. Ch. 3 is devoted to the plant's fruit and sap, theopobalsamum. Next, the distinctive characteristics of the balm sap are described and the information to be found in the ancient sources is reviewed (ch. 4).  In ch. 5, it is discussed how true balm can be distinguished from fakes. Ch. 6 treats the fruit (carpobalsamum) and the wood (xilobalsamum) of the shrub. – An appendix (chs. 7–8) contains a Latin translation of book 2, ch. 39 ofPierre Belon'sObservations de plusieurs singularites & choses memorables(Paris 1553, 2nd ed. 1588) that accords with the views voiced in the dialogue.The interlocutors are highly critical of the ancient classics such as Dioscurides and Theophrastus, who presumably have never seen a balsam shrub (fol. 10v). Conversely, a medieval authority of Arab origin such as Constantinus Africanus is quoted at length and with approval (fol. 9r–10v). This openness vis-à-vis non-western knowledge, which is not too common among Renaissance scientists, is matched by the polite, respectful and friendly way the interlocutors treat each other, although they represent three different religions. (At the very beginning, fol. 1r, for instance, Abdella calls Abdachim avir honestissimis moribus, quamvis Hebraeus, praeditus mihique multum familiaris, ""an extremely decent man, although a Jew, and  a good friend of mine"".)  One could even be tempted to see the religious affiliations of the collocutors and their close relationship as a veiled plea for religious tolerance. Venice, the setting of the roughly contemporaryColloquium heptaplomeres, would be a convenient place to have such a plea printed.The dialogue is written in a fluent, not overly technical Latin that is easy and pleasurable to read. The descriptions of the plant and its products, in particular, are precise, graphic, and lively. An interesting technical twist is given to the beginning of the dialogue, quoted in part above, which is styled as a soliloquy of Abdella.As balsam was a precious drug about which there was much doubt and Alpino appeared as a trustworthy authority, the dialogue was quite a success. Until 1750, it was reprinted at least eight times, alone and in combination with other works, especially Alpino'sDe plantis AegyptiandDe medicina Aegyptiorum, as well as translated into Italian and French.",,"Alpino, Prospero‎(← links)","Alpino, Prospero:De balsamo dialogus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_balsamo_dialogus(last revision: 06.07.2022).","Annotated copy in share folder 3.2, primary literature.Could the images of the twig be an allusion to Virgil's golden bough?",MK,Yes,MK,

De libris propriis liber unus,1570,London,Gulielmus Seresius,16th century,"Monograph, Letter, Historia",Biology,De canibus Britannicis(archive.org),686638,"This short workOn British Dogsby the English court physician and refounder of the college named after him in Cambridge is an early example of a zoological monograph, that is, a work discussing one particular taxon in detail. Among the not too numerous 16th century texts of this kind (Bäumer 1991–1996, vol. 2, 194–220), the present one is special in its restriction to a particular country, Britain, its focus on a group of domestic animals, and its structure: it does not talk about dogs in general, but meticulously subdivides the field down to the least describable unit, the single breeds, and discusses each of them.The work is styled as a letter – albeit an informal one, as it lacks address and valediction – toConrad Gessner. If Caius had not learned by 1570 that Gessner had died five years previously or if the publication was delayed remains unclear. As Caius initially informs the reader, he already had sent Gessner a draft a few years ago for inclusion in the latter'sIcones animaliumbut changed his mind subsequently and asked him not to publish the piece, as he judged it incomplete. Now he has elaborated on the text and produced a more systematic work on British dogs in general, their various kinds, use, character, and mental abilities (p. 3).The account proper starts from a subdivision of British dogs into three kinds, namely the noble, the rustic, and the degenerate dog (canis generosa,rustica,degener). These categories broadly correspond to hunting dogs, watchdogs, and dogs Caius thinks useless (pp. 3–4). Each category is then subdivided in turn. Noble dogs, for instance, arecanes venatici,aucupatorii, ordelicati(dogs hunting game, dogs hunting fowl, lapdogs). Dogs hunting game comprise five varieties, namely dogs relying on their sense of smell, their visual sense, their speed, their sense of smell as well as their speed, and cunning respectively. Finally, those with a fine nose are classified according to their prey – hares, foxes, deer, and so on. The three main kinds – hunting dogs, watchdogs, useless dogs – are discussed on pp. 4–9, 10–14, and 14–15 respectively. After some notes onexterni canes(foreign dogs imported into Britain), a Ramist table – one of the first-ever used in a biological work, it seems – illustrates the above subdivision, with the names of the single breeds being given in Latin and English. On the last pages, the English terms are discussed and explained (pp. 17–19). After a valediction to Gessner, the work is rounded off by a short index of dog names and other things.Since the work's first version was meant as a contribution to a zoological work by Gessner, it is small wonder that Caius shares Gessner's approach to animals, which is characterized by a great interest in cultural-historical and philological aspects, all the more since the animal in question is closely tied to human interests and activities. For this reason, Caius' classification is based on the various uses of dogs by man, and the reader is informed not only about the appearance and behaviour of various breeds but also about topics like the frequency of cattle raiding in northern England (p. 5), the prediction of Richard II's downfall by his dog (p. 6) or the alleviation of stomach pains by pet dogs (p. 9). Throughout the account, Caius' patriotism is evident, as is his sympathy for the animals described. He is happy to inform his readers about British customs and peculiarities and likes to highlight the astonishing capacities of his dogs. The way in which bloodhounds persecute poachers is characterized as follows (p. 5):Cum tamen fieri solet, ut furum astutia nullo conspersa sanguine abripiatur fera, etiam sicca hominis vestigia per extentissima spatia nullo errore sequi norunt, in quantalibet multitudine secernere, per abditissima et densissima loca appetere et si flumina tranent etiam persequi, cumque ad ulteriorem ripam perventum est, circuitu quodam qua fugitum est investigare, si primo statim odore in vestigium furis non inciderint.But if it happens that an animal is taken away without being sprinkled with blood because the poachers are so sly, the bloodhounds are able to follow also the dry traces of a man over very long stretches without any error, to know him apart in a crowd no matter how big, to target him through most remote and overgrown places and even to pursuit poachers if they swim through rivers, and if they have come to the other shore, to somehow move in circles to find out where the thieves have escaped, if they do not encounter the tracks at first smell.The passage also exemplifies Caius' style: he writes humanist Latin, constructs periods of sometimes considerable length, and uses few technical terms apart from dog names.De canibus Britannicisbecame popular not only in England itself but also on the continent. It was republished several times in England, Germany, and the Netherlands, often together with other short works by Caius. An English translation (On English Dogges) appeared in 1576 and went through a number of editions as well, while the original Latin text was republished in 1685, 1728, and 1729. Because theeditio princepswas not available, the text of an early 20th century opera omnia edition (Roberts; Venn 1912) was chosen for the present entry.","Bäumer 1991–1996, vol. 2, 194–197",,"Caius, John:De canibus Britannicis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_canibus_Britannicis(last revision: 02.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The title is somewhat misleading. In fact, the text falls in two parts, the first of which is more concerned with defending Cardano than passing judgement on him, while the second is a meticulous bibliography.The first part starts from a profession of Naudé's love for and expertise in Cardano's writings (fol. a iiii r – a v v) and then falls into four sections devoted to Cardano's character (fol. a v v – e vi v), the overall nature of his thinking (fol. e vi v – i ii v), some specific allegations against him (fol. i ii v – o ii v) and his literary style (fol. o ii v – o vii r): Cardano comes across as an evil character in his writings, but in fact, all men are evil, and Cardano was just more open than the rest. It cannot be denied that he nonetheless often lied about himself, as in the case of his allegedgeniusornumen, which is a patent fiction. All of this results from the fact that he, like other great men, was amelancholicus(fol. e vi r) and often out of his mind: hence the inconsistency of his words and actions. – Cardano's thinking must be judged as a whole, since he was a universal genius, perhaps the greatest of all times, surely greater than his adversary Julius Caesar Scaliger. – Cardano's numerous autobiographical and autobibliographical works are not blameworthy. Many great men have written similar things. His wrong astrological predictions are nothing special either, since astrology is a treacherous art per se. Cardano was not even alone in casting a horoscope of Christ. – Cardano's style is neither over-elaborate nor too careless. If he occasionally lapses into obscurity, this is mainly caused by his extreme erudition, which can induce him to jump associatively from one topic or discipline to another.Naudé's own text is written in spirited rhetorical prose, full of elegant figures of speech and bold enthymemes, and gives the impression of a court speech. For instance, Naudé does not hesitate to defend the character of his hero by condemning humankind tout court (fol. a viii r):Omnes enim homines suapte natura mali, stulti, improbi sunt, et si palam offendunt, quanto magis inter privatae familiae saepta Cardano similes existunt? Unde qui eum odit propter privatas illas turpitudines, hunc etiam reliquos homines odisse convenit, si in eorum intima semel descendat.(""For all men are bad, stupid, evil by their very nature, and since they give offence even in public, how much more are they similar to Cardano in the secret space of their own family? So he, who hates Cardano for his well-known infamous actions committed in private, should also hate all other men, if he could enter their innermost life"".) The argument is bolstered by numerous citations from Cardano's works throughout.In the bibliographical part (fol. o vii r – * vii r), one sees Naudé the librarian at work. It opens with a catalogue of printed books by Cardano, ordered according to format, from folio to duodecimo (fol. o vii v – u vi r), which is followed by a detailed proposal for anopera omniaedition in eight volumes (fo. u vi r – * ii v). Thirdly and lastly, Naudé provides an overview of the fate of Cardano's manuscripts (fol. * ii v – * vii r).A shortened version of theDe Cardano iudicium, from which the last two sections of the second part had been removed, was prefixed to the first tome of Cardano'sOpera omniain ten volumes (1663). At the same time, Naudé's suggestions regarding the publication of Cardano's works presumably helped to shape this very edition.",,"Naudé, Gabriel‎(← links)","Naudé, Gabriel:De Cardano iudicium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_Cardano_iudicium(last revision: 04.10.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

This changed only in the sixteenth century (Nutton 1985) when humanist interest also took these texts into focus.Thus, this collection was very important for the dissemination of knowledge on surgery as many of the treatises have not been published in Germany before as is stated on the title page and at the end of the following list of works contained in the volume. Apart from Latin translations of works by Oribasius andGalenus, most of the treatises included are by fairly recent authors mostly from Italy and France: Jean Tagault, Jacques Houllier, Mariano Santo, Angelo Bolognini, Michelangelo Biondi, Bartholomaeo Maggi, Alfonso Ferri, Johann Lange, Jacobus de Dondis. Most of the works deal with surgery in general or specific diseases or techniques, there is, however also a glossary by Jacobus de Dondis of terms important for surgery as well as short text by Gessner himself on the importance of surgery together with an overview of important surgeons and their works from antiquity to his own time.
There is an exhaustive table of content at the beginning of the volume in which every work and the chapters are listed. An alphabetical index of important terms can be found at the end.
Gessner states in the dedicatory letter to Geryon Seiler that his cousins, the printers Andreas and Jacob Gessner, encouraged him to issue a collected volume of treatises on surgery. Gessner explains his choice with the following criteria: He has excluded those that he did not have at hand or whose works were to big to combine it with others, or if they did not meet his standards oflatinitas(vel quod sermone sordido et parum Latino conscripti). Also those works that are easily available everywhere were left out.

One of them was Oronce Finé, who in 1544 published a booklet in quarto containing a collection of short monographs discussing questions from mathematics, astronomy and mathematical geography. As befits his position as professor of mathematics at the Collège Royale, the booklet is nicely printed, features neat diagrams and instructive marginalia and is introduced by a royal privilege, a letter of dedication to Francis I and nine laudatory poems by friends and colleagues (including one to Finé's wife complimenting her on her prodigious husband).Within the volume, pride of place is given toThe Squaring of the Circle Finally Discovered and Proved(pp. 1–24). Not only the position of the treatise, but also the larger font used for it on the title page expresses the author's pride in his achievement. Of course, his elation was premature. His construction only gives the appearance of working because he uses a (quite bad) approximation π (as becomes clear on pp. 17–22) of (22+2/9)/7 (approximately 3,17), which is far beyond Archimedes's estimates of 3 10/71 < π < 3 10/70, well known also at that time. An appendix to the treatise proper (p. 25–40), in which Finé, in the wake of Archimedes, analyzes two more questions related to the circle, contains some mistakes as well. While the proof that the area of a circle is its radius times half its perimeter is essentially correct, the assertion that – contrary to Archimedes's estimate and even to his previous suggestion – π is less than 3 10/71 is wrong and the subsequent approximation by 3 2/15 constitutes another regression compared to Archimedes' value (pp. 38–39). These errors were promptly recognized and pointed out by Finé's colleagues such asPedro Nuñez(De erratis Orontii Finaei) and Johannes Buteo. The attacks were probably even more fierce due to Finé's overly arrogant presentation of obviously wrong results.In terms of form, the treatise well exemplifies the massive influence of Euclid'sElementson early modern mathematical writing. As in Euclid, the otherwise neat and classical language is highly formulaic, repeats technical terms such assemidiameter(""radius"") orcircumferentia(""perimeter"") over and over again and references the accompanying diagrams by letters. The text is subdivided, not into hierarchically defined sections such as chapters and paragraphs, but into functional units, namelyproblemata,propositionesandcorollaria. TheElementsthemselves are cited so elliptically that it looks as if Finé and his readers knew them almost by heart. The notion ""according to proposition 31 of book 3 of theElements"" is simply expressed asper trigesimamprimam tertii Elementorum(p. 5) without even a hint at the content of the respective proposition.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 15, 153–157.","Finé, Oronce‎(← links)","Finé, Oronce:De circuli quadratura tandem adinventa et demonstrata, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_circuli_quadratura_tandem_adinventa_et_demonstrata(last revision: 25.01.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

In it, Maier explains his theory of the healing properties of gold. According to alchemical symbolism, gold is the squared circle because it is perfect (circle) and combines the four elemental qualities (square). Moreover, the squaring of the circle is according to alchemists like Maier not only a question of geometry but also of physics, as the production of gold is equivalent to the (as known today impossible) squaring of the circle in geometry. Hence the title:On the Physically Squared Circle, That Is Gold  [...].""In a beautiful poem (Carmen authoris summam libri exponens) in elegant elegiac distiches, Maier explains the “theoretical foundations” of his treatise (p. 6f.): In an analogy of microcosm and macrocosm the sun, the human heart and ultimately also gold are bound wonderfully together and provide theharmonia mundi:Sol ut imago Dei, sic est cor solis et aurum.– “As the sun is the image/reflection of God, so are heart and gold of the sun.” Maier even specifies these intervals as of an octave between God and sun, of four between sun and gold, and eight between the human heart and god. In this, he probably draws on Neoplatonic mysticism and is probably inspired by Marsilio Ficino’s works (seeTilton 2003, 183). 
The sun, the heart and gold are analoguous to each other as they have the same “virtues” or properties. They are the kings in their respective cosmos and provide heat that brings live. This theory is also found in other works by Maier, for example in hisCivitas corporis humani. Therefore, gold can help the heart in providing heat and thus be used in medicine. 
The treatise itself is divided into twelve chapters that are easily accessible through a table of content (“Elenchus capitum singulorum huius tractatus”; p. 8–10) that also provides a short summary of each chapter. The first part (chapters 1–7) lays the “theoretical foundations”, the second part is more practical and deals with the application of gold in medicine (“Theoreticas auri proprietates […] iam produximus, restant practicae […].” – “We have already demonstrated the theoretical properties of gold […], the practical remain[…].” Beginning of chapter 8; p. 49).

Tommaso Strozzi's three books on cocoa constitute ""[b]y far the most ambitious and accomplished modern Latin didactic poem devoted to an intoxicating substance"" (Haskell 2003, 83).In a little less than 1800 hexameters, the Neapolitan Jesuit sings about the origins of the American plant, shares cocoa recipes, describes a machine that produces chocolate ice and discusses the use of cocoa as a remedy. The first book deals with the cultivation and collection of the ingredients cocoa, vanilla and sugar. The second book treats the actual making of chocolate, which was, as Strozzi tells it with colonial undertones, perfected only by the European invaders. The third book finally is devoted to the medical properties of cocoa, especially its effects against hypochondria, of which the poet'spersonahas suffered as well.Throughout the poem, descriptions of exotic curiosities and scientific explanations with an emphasis on experience go hand in hand with vivid myths. For example, in the first book, the poet provides the cocoa tree with a mythical origin. When Apollo and the Muses migrated from Greece to Mexico, Apollo created cocoa by plunging his spear into the ground, thus providing a drink with poetic powers on his ""new Parnassus"" (the cocoa tree might be parallelised with the guaiacum tree in Fracastoro'sSyphilis). In the second book, Athena appears toFrancisco Hernández(the author ofRerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus), as he explores the Mexican nature, revealing to him that the bitter cocoa should be sweetened with vanilla and sugar. But Strozzi draws not only on the apparatus of pagan mythology, but also on Christian legends, which is much rarer in didactic poetry. The third book contains the story of how Rose of Lima (1586–1617) was mysteriously cured by a cocoa beverage.De cocolatis opificioprobably enjoyed only a limited circulation, as it never saw a second edition and survives only in about thirty copies, most of which are held by Italian libraries.","Haskell 2003, 82–101Schindler 2020b","Thia Sinensis‎(← links)Strozzi, Tommaso‎(← links)","Strozzi, Tommaso:De cocolatis opificio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_cocolatis_opificio(last revision: 16.10.2021).",,,Yes,IT,

At the oratorical event, which took place on 7th November 1675 at 8 o'clock in the morning, an impressive number of students presented classroom dissertations on colours.On the last page of the printed leaflet, a programme details the topics and the names of the participating students. As a rule, two students were assigned to one subject and delivered their dissertation in the form of a dialogue (cf. fol. B2r). There were two kinds of dissertations: first, discussions of single colours (e.g. blue), which had been translated from German into Latin (sermonibus e lingua Germanica in Latinam translatis); second, a comparison of colours, presented both in Latin (by four students) and in German (by two students). Following the students' performances, a short poem on the best colour white was recited, before the rector handed out silver coins as prizes to the participating students.The programme was introduced by an invitation letter of ten pages, which was distributed one day in advance (cf. fol. B2r). It was most likely written by Johann Fechner, the rector of Magdalene Gymnasium and organiser of the act. Interestingly, the letter presents a short scientific discussion on colours. Starting with a proem on the beauty of the cosmos, the outline draws on ancient prose and poetry as well as medieval and early modern scholarship (there is no reference to Newton'stheory of light and colouryet). In the course of the text, a few interesting questions on colours are singled out and discussed in more detail, for example ""Does the colour black contain light within itself?"", ""Why is the sky blue?"", and ""What is the colour of snow?"". The letter also contains a passionate vindication of experimental science (fol. A3r). At the end, the readers are invited to attend the upcoming event at Magdalene Gymnasium.While the author adopts a simple style in the scientific discussion, other passages, like the proem and the vindication of experimental science, are written in grand style and highlighted by rhetorical emphasis.The intention behind including an outline on colours in the invitation letter might be to arouse interest in the topic of the act, or to brush up the audience's knowledge before they came to listen to the students' dissertations.",,"Fechner, Johann‎(← links)","Fechner, Johann:De coloribus iuventus delecta disseret, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_coloribus_iuventus_delecta_disseret(last revision: 29.10.2021).",HTR+ missing (SZ)Digital copy not suitable for Transkribus (SZ),,Yes,IT,

While it helped Tycho Brahe to ascertain that comets are superlunary phenomena, many other authors were more conservative. Giovanni Battista Baffi, doctor and professor at Perugia, used the rare celestial phenomenon (to which he refers on fol. 2r) as an opportunity to publish a short encyclopedic work on comets in which much traditional wisdom could be found summarised on some 200 quarto pages. As a certain Gaspare Circino from Spoleto advised the reader in one of several laudatory poems introducing Baffi's compendium, the book provided a summary of the previous literature and a shortcut to a sound knowledge about comets:Te non ergo decet libros vagari / per multos veterum, ast iter tenendum / est longe brevius, laborque nullus / scandendo superas domos Olympi / reddet fessum animum via patenti.(""So you have no need to wander through many ancient books. Stay on this much shorter path: no toil will tire your mind, while you will ascend to the abodes of the sky above on this open road."")Apart from the poems of praise, a table of contents and a list of all authors cited in the work, theThree Books on Cometsare also introduced by a dedication to the lawyer and antiquarian Pirro Stefanucci from Todi which is answered – an unusual feature – by a letter of thanks from the dedicatee. The volume is concluded by one more panegyrical poem, a short treatise on foetal viability (thePythagorica consideratio, quo mense vivere possit editus foetusmentioned in the full title) and a list of errata, which is introduced – another uncommon trait – by a printer's note to the reader.On a macroscopic level, the compendium is neatly structured into three books subdivided into 14, 15 and 14 chapters respectivly. Book one discusses the designation and nature of comets (including a review of the respective opinions of ancient thinkers), book two, their various kinds, book three, their disastrous effects. This overall structure is conveniently laid out in the aforementioned table of contents, and the reader is occasionally reminded of it in the course of the argument. Book two, for instance, begins (fol. 24v):Explicata criniti sideris natura illud sequi videtur, ut de differentiis ipsius agamus …(""After our account of the nature of the hairy orb, it appears as the logical next step to discuss its different kinds …""). Within the single chapters, in contrast, Baffi is extremely prone to digressions. This is particularly true of book one, where the various opinions about comets are buried under a heap of excursuses; the book may be said to approach a haphazard history of ancient philosophy at large. But Baffi freely follows his associations in the later books as well. For instance, chapter 12 of book two, titledOn the Colours of Comets, is to a large part taken up by an account of Plato's theory of vision and an excursus on the colour purple. The author's digressive habits are compounded by his love for classical poetry, which he takes every occasion to quote at length.Although Baffi often voices his admiration of Plato, his account is mainly inspired by Aristotle and the Aristotelian tradition in form and substance. In starting from an extended doxography before explaining his own opinions, he explicitly follows Aristotelian practice (Aristotelem imitantes, fol. 2v). His general understanding of comets as meteorological, sublunary phenomena is of course Aristotelian as well. Questions of detail, for instance how a comet, which is dry and hot, can produce dry and cold weather, are likewise answeredex Aristotele, Avicenna, Averroe et Alexandro Aphrodisio(fol. 55v). However, Aristotelian physics is integrated into a Christian framework in scholastic manner, as is evident from the long list of disasters (droughts, storms, earthquakes, sterility, plagues, wars, deaths of princes, falls of empires, religious sects, monsters, floods) enumerated in the last book. Comets, which predict and/or cause all of these calamities, are assigned a clearly defined place in the divine order. They must be understood as warnings and punishments from God, as stated with particular emphasis in the final chapter (3.14,On the True Cause and Agency of a Comet).Baffi's Latin is unobtrusive and comparatively easy. It contains no traces of scholastic Latinity. The syntax is classical, and most of the technical terms adopted are relatively common.The book seems to have sold well, at least within Italy. Nearly 30 extant copies can easily be located in Italian libraries.

In the treatise intended as a response to non-Aristotelian philosophies of nature widely emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century (Pomponazzi, Telesio, Porzio), Pereira redesigned the role of physics in the whole of philosophy and expressly states that there is a metaphysics that precedes all particular regions of philosophy - something which would later be called ""ontology"".Originally composed in 1576 in Paris and reprinted numerous times over the end of the sixteenth centuries across Europe, theDe communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis et affectionibusis largely based on Pereira's lectures at the Collegio Romano that he presented in the 1560s. Although, according to its title, the book is mostly concerned with Aristotle'sPhysics, manuscript evidence suggests that the distinction between metaphysics, physics and mathematics was first developed in Pereira's lectures on Aristotle's other writings, mainly onMetaphysics. Overall, the volume's structure, style and main goal demonstrate that it was designed as a general program of teaching philosophy and scientific matters within the Jesuit order.
Pereira states that there are two main ""sects"" whose approach to philosophy and science should be rejected: while within the first one people refuse and condemn all philosophical matters as something which contradicts Christian teaching, there are also those who believe that everything can be proven by rational arguments and philosophy. By claiming that there is a universal science that incorporates all other sciencesin seand is, therefore, above all other disciplines, Pereira advocates natural philosophy and provides a theoretical framework within which natural philosophical investigation is a valid way to observe the beauty of nature as the most illustrative demonstration of God's will. At the same time, he insists that considering his general argument on the place of metaphysics, Aristotle's authority in natural philosophical matters is not absolute, which, in turn, opens the door for further naturalistic research, especially in the cases when Aristotle was wrong. Thus, by dividing the functions of metaphysics, natural philosophical disciplines, and by reconsidering the method of natural philosophical investigation, Pereira makes a significant contribution to both the sixteenth-century Aristotelian tradition of natural philosophy and the emerging Jesuit approach to the study of nature.",Blum 2012,"Pereira, Benedict‎(← links)","Pereira, Benedict:De communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis et affectionibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_communibus_omnium_rerum_naturalium_principiis_et_affectionibus(last revision: 31.08.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

The translation was done by Ruf's compatriot, the cleric Wolfgang Haller (Keller; Steinke 2008, 325). While the German original was primarily directed at midwives and may have played a role in their regular examinations by the city doctor, the Latin version targeted learned physicians. This corresponds to the status of gynecology, embryology and obstetrics, the subjects of the treatise, which were of interest to non-Latinate practitioners and town authorities on the one hand and to students of medicine and academically trained doctors on the other. It also fits the personality and status of Ruf, who had no academic training but whose ambitions clearly exceeded that of a mere craftsman.De conceptufills some 200 quarto pages, which are divided into six books comprising six to fifteen chapters. The work's structure is justified as the best possible, because it follows the ways of nature itself, in the preface (tradendi enim meliorem fingere quam ipsa natura sequitur ordinem nemo poterit), and its contents are laid out in a clear table (Dispositio operis per argumenta librorum et capitum): Book 1 deals with the generation and the growth of the fetus in the womb. Book 2 discusses the uterus and the condition of the fetus therein and gives some prescriptions for the behaviour of pregnant women. Book 3 is dedicated to birth itself; it also explains which care should be taken of the mother and her new-born child. Book 4 contains a detailed discussion of abnormal and dangerous positions of the fetus in the womb. In book 5, Ruf devotes himself to ulcers in the uterus, monstrous births and signs of conception. In its last book, the work discusses reasons for and cures of sterility as well as various uterine diseases.The Latin version follows the German original closely in terms of content. It also takes over the nearly 70 precise and informative woodcuts of the former. By contrast, the style is less personal and more sober in the Latin. Strings of colourful adjectives, moralistic reasonings, personal interventions of the author and addresses to the reader are much reduced. This tendency is in evidence already in the title:Ein schön lustig Trostbüchle von den Empfengknussen und Geburten der Menschen unnd jren vilfaltigen Zuofälen und Verhindernussen(A Pretty, Pleasurable Book of Comfort about the Conceptions and Births of Men, Their Numerous Emergencies and Impediments) gives way to the less alluring and dramaticDe conceptu et generatione hominis et iis, quae circa haec potissimum considerantur(On the Conception and Procreation of Man and on the Things to Be Observed in This Respect in the First Place).The introductory paratexts are changed as well. While theTrostbüchleis introduced by a letter of dedication to the burgomaster of Zurich,De conceptufeatures a preface to the reader. In it, Ruf puts less emphasis on the usefulness of his work for women and more on his personal achievement, as he claims to have written the first satisfactory overview of the topic ever. He also briefly mentions the fact that the present text has been translated from the vernacular for the benefit of readers who like Latin better (noluimus tamen te, humanissime lector, huius[i.e.Latinae]linguae desiderio magis detentum hoc fraudare opusculo), but forgets to mention the name of the translator. Two woodcuts depicting scenes of labour and childcare with exclusively female personell, which can be found before and after the table of contents in the German edition, have been removed. Instead, the table of contents is followed by a poem of praise in the first epodic metre (alternating iambic trimeters and dimeters) byConrad Gessner.In 1580, a new edition of both the German and the Latin version was issued by Sigmund Feyerabend in Frankfurt. It was reprinted in in 1587 and 1588 (Keller; Steinke 2008, 313). Moreover, the work was translated into several vernaculars such as English, Dutch and Czech.","Keller; Steinke 2008Keller et al. 2008, vol. 4, 265–783 (introduction, German and Latin version, commentary, texts documenting the work's success)","Ruf, Jacob‎(← links)Broadsheet on Conjoint Twins‎(← links)Keller et al. 2008‎(← links)Haller, Wolfgang‎(← links)","Ruf, Jacob; Haller, Wolfgang:De conceptu et generatione hominis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_conceptu_et_generatione_hominis(last revision: 27.05.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

Within a few days, it grew to an altitude of over 130 meters, ejecting huge masses of vulcanic ash in the process. The presentLetter on the Blaze in the Region of Pozzuoliby the doctor and philosopher Simone Porzio constitutes is a late, but interesting reaction to this spectacular incident. The work is a very concise treatise (six quarto pages) in the form of a letter to the Neapolitan viceroy Pedro de Toledo y Zúñiga. It gives a precise description of the events and explains them within the framework of Aristotelian meteorology. Presumably, the letter was written long before it was published, as remarks such as those regarding the event's ominous character (below) would have been pointless thirteen years after it took place. The reasons for the belated printing remain obscure.After thesalutatio, Porzio starts from a short address to the viceroy, announcing that he wants to protect him against belief in idle rumours about the disaster (p. 3). After a description of the region and the events (pp. 3–4), the author details the causes of earthquakes: subterranean exhalations caught in caverns and trying to escape shake the earth. The formation of these vapours is favoured by astrological factors, particularly conjunctions, and such weather conditions as prevail in spring and autumn. A rainy summer, such as in 1538, also contributes to their power. Daytime and location are important as well: earthquakes often happen at the break of dawn and at noon and in places with porous soil which are situated close to the sea (pp. 4–6). Most of these factors came together to cause the earthquakes in Campania, the formation and eruption of the new mountain, the concomitant retreat of the sea nearby, and the ermergence of new springs (pp. 6–7). Having thus explained what happened, Porzio raises and answers a series of questions (dubia, pp. 7–8): Was the subterranean fire creating the new volcano kindled by the rapid movement of the exhalations, or did it already exist before? Why does Monte Nuovo emit smoke only from time to time? Why was the ash ejected dry when raining down near the mountain but moist at a greater distance? Is the event an omen? (No, except that a drought will probably follow.) The work closes with a list of similar incidents from earlier times (p. 8).Porzio is bent on explaining the formation of Monte Nuovo in strictly natural terms and on excluding any possibility of divine intervention. The thrust of his work is rationalist and educational. The opening sentence is programmatic in this respect:Multa sunt, quae, etsi naturali ratione eveniant, quia tamen raro contingunt, portenta hominibus, atque iis maxime, qui rumore potius ea quam visu percipiunt, videri solent.There are many events which, although they happen in a natural way, usually appear as ominous miracles to men because of their rarity, and particularly to those who learn of them from gossip rather than eyewitness.In terms of form, the treatise is concise, clearly structured, and written in impeccable Ciceronian periods. The letter format is purely external. It has no impact on the content and form of the pamphlet at large.

It comprises 14 elegiac distiches, i.e. 28 verses and was composed by Philipp Melanchthon in Nuremberg on the day of the conversion of St Paul (25 January) 1552 as is indicated at the end of the poem. The original – probably handwritten by Melanchthon himself (seeSchullian 1945, 438f.) – is contained on a flyleaf of a first edition now owned by the National Library of Medicine (Catalogue Number NLM 2295005). The poem became popular and was also copied into other editions of Vesalius’s work (seeMargócsy; Somos; Joffe 2018, 73 and 112).In the poem, Melanchthon states that the world is not the product of chance and atoms, but made by a divine intellect. This can be seen in the good order of the macrocosm, i.e. the earth and the sky, and of the microcosm, i.e. the human body. A good knowledge of the natural world and the human body leads to a better understanding and recognition of the creation and above all its creator. Melanchthon thus links theology and science. As the human body is the “temple of God” (cum templum vellet nos Deus esse sibi), this body shall not be polluted and profaned. Similar ideas can also be found in Vesalius’s work (seeMargócsy; Somos; Joffe 2018, 112).
The poem is written in elegant Latin. The same holds true for the metre.

Whilemethoduspieces like theNova methodus utendi maximis vitriswere short recipes, the contribution on the petrified crocodile is a kind of show-piece on an interesting curiosity, which is both seriously examined and framed in lavish rhetoric of wonder and novelty. The first three of nineteen pages are taken up by an epideictic introduction which celebrates King Frederick I for founding the Prussian Academy of Sciences, introduces and advertises the topic of the paper, and praises the wonders of the mineral world.For his contribution to the first issue of the academy's journal, Spener chose a particularly spectacular specimen of figured stones (what is known today as fossils): a crocodile in Germany. With this ""foreign and unknown visitor"" from the Nile (peregrinus ignotusque hospes, p. 99), Spener was able to present something new and curious, as it was demanded by the journal, as well as something  fashionable, as figured stones were a favourite object of scientific study at the time (cf. Johann Jakob Scheuchzer'sHerbarium diluvianumor Johann Bartholomäus Adam Beringer'sLithographia Wirceburgensisin this database).In fact, the information on Spener's crocodile had already been circulating in the community before the paper was published. Spener's Swiss colleague Scheuchzer announced the publication already in 1708 in hisPiscium querelae et vindiciae, in which he provided a preliminary sketch of the specimen (p. 30). Spener in turn analysed the crocodile against the background of contemporary reports and studies, comparing it to other findings of figured stones and discussing its origin in the light of the relevant literature. His paper provided a systematic and detailed description of the object and argued that a real crocodile had been transported to Germany by the biblical deluge and consequently petrified. Images of the crocodile stone and other fossils can be found in the appendix of the issue.The paper was printed together with a Latin letter in which the president of the academy,Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, responded to Spener's argument (pp. 118–120). AGerman translationof Spener's contribution appeared in 1781, in the first volume of a collection of the academy's scientific and medical papers (pp. 14–40). With the development of paleontology in the nineteenth century, it became clear that the crocodile was, in fact, a protorosaurus. As Spener was the first to describe and provide a detailed illustration of this early reptile, the paleontologist Hermann von Meyer coined the nameProtorosaurus Speneri.",Brandt 2011,"Spener, Christian Maximilian‎(← links)","Spener, Christian Maximilian:De crocodilo in lapide scissili expresso, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_crocodilo_in_lapide_scissili_expresso(last revision: 29.10.2021).","...

The medical treatise is among the first contributions to contemporary discussion over the effects and treatment of gunshot wounds. It draws extensively on the author’s experience as a military doctor working with the French army after he finished his studies.The text opens with eight pages of prefatory material, in which Botallus first addresses his dedicatee, military officer Carlo Coseo from Brescia, and then directs himself to readers of his treatise with an explanation of the novelty of his topic in medical literature resulting from the relatively recent appearance of firearms as standard weaponry in armed conflict.The work proper begins with an introductory discussion (pp. 9–24) of earlier ideas about gunshot wounds, in particular those of neapolitan medicAlfonso Ferri (1500-1595), personal physician to Pope Paul III. Botallo cites at length Ferri’s beliefs that the harm done by gunshot is due primarily to the “poisonous” nature of gunpowder and bullets. Botallo does not deny that gunshot wounds can easily become infected, but he rejects the toxic theory in setting his focus instead on the damage done by the impact of bullets and penetration into the human body.The work now proceeds in 27 chapters. The first two (pp. 24–30) deal with the primary importance and methods of extracting foreign bodies from a person who has been shot. Botallo specifies that foreign bodies include, of course, bullets and other pieces of shrapnel that may have entered the body as a result of the gunshot, but also pieces of broken bone and damaged flesh that cannot recover. He next deals in chapters three and four (pp.) with methods of recognising and rescuing damaged other damaged tissue. There next follows a series of chapters on curative methods which aim to redress imbalances in the humoral profile of victims of a shooting, including, for example, phlebotomy (chp. 9, pp. 38–46). Chapter 14 (pp. 56–62) addresses the importance of stopping bleeding when dealing with gunshot wounds. Here Botallo proposes a list of methods including binding, cauterizing, and cooling to stem the flow of blood. The next chapter turns to the question of curing wounds after initial treatment in the longer term. There follow special, lengthier chapters on headwounds (chp. 16, pp. 66–96), wounds to the thorax (chp. 17, pp. 96–110), wounds to the lower torso (chp. 18, pp. 111–116) and then to the limbs (chp. 19, pp. 116-125). These chapters involve the introduction of specialised instruments to facilitate the removal of foreign bodies and the release of pressure within affected areas. The subsequent set of shorter chapters (chps. 20–27, pp. 125–150) deal with secondary damage. Botallo addresses burns, inflammation, the onset of gangrene and the removal of rotting flesh, before he turns to issues of longterm care, which include methods of healing the skin, the formation of health scar-tissue and the use of medicines.Botallo’s text is accompanied with basic illustrations of specialized medical instruments throughout. His expertise in gunshot wounds, and in particular the necessity of stopping bleeding after a shooting, would serve Botallo well, as he was called as part of a group of physicians to attend to William the Silent, Prince of Orange, in Antwerp after the failed assassination attempt by Juan de Jáuregui 18th March 1582. Jáuregui’s shot wounded the Prince severely in the neck and it would take the team of doctors (of whichTurcq, Pascasius Justuswas presumably also part) ten days to stem the flow of blood.",Taccari 1971Tozzo et al. 2020,,"Botallo, Leonardo:De curandis vulneribus sclopettorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_curandis_vulneribus_sclopettorum(last revision: 28.03.2022).",,,Yes,WB,

At first, he intended to describe the whole of natural history, but as the world of plants have already been covered byJean Ruel(presumably in hisDe natura stirpium libri tres) and the minerals byGeorgius Agricola(presumably in hisDe natura fossilium; seeBäumer 1991, 32), he decided to focus on animals (fol. a ii v). He claims the Aristotle is his model and guide to follow, but the starting point would be the animals themselves (Hoc [Aristotele] igitur ceu itineris duce usus […], initium paulo altius ab ipso animali repetere institui; fol. a iii r;Bäumer 1991, 32), a hint that Wotton will not only refer to ancient authorities but also to autopsy. Furthermore, Wotton describes the difficulties that arose when writing a book like his such as conflicting statements on the same animal by different authors, the difficulty of identifying names and animals, and problems with Greek texts.There is, moreover, an interesting statement concerning the style: Wotton says that there might well be some stylistic infelicities in his text, but these are due to the fact that he simply takes over text from his sources if they are in Latin (fol. a iii v). Thus, he blames his source texts for any shortcomings in Latin.
After the introductory letter, there is Greek poem in elegiac couplets by a certain doctor named Jacob Gopylos praising the author and the work. This is followed by aprivilegiumand two indices that are already mentioned on the title page. One is a detailed table of content and the other anindex locorum. Wotton’s main source is Aristotle but he cites also about 200 other (mostly ancient) authors (Bäumer 1991, 34). He hardly adduces any new knowledge, but it is important, that Wotton goes beyond Aristotle and many of his predecessors in trying to establish a system of animals and differentiates “subclasses” in the bigger taxa. He does not simply present the animals in the single books in alphabetic order (Bäumer 1991, 34f.; 40).
Each of the ten books deals with a different topic. Books one and two discuss general aspects of zoology, that is, parts of animals and their functions (book one) and especially those parts which serve to differentiate the animals (book two). Book three contains some general remarks on “animals with blood” (that is in our modern systematic mostly vertebrates). The other books present different “classes” of animals according to ascala naturae: humans (book four), viviparous quadrupeds (book five), oviparous quadrupeds (book six), birds (book seven), fish (including Cetaceae; book eight), “insects“ (including spiders etc.; book nine); water animals without blood (molluscs; crustaceae, etc.; book 10).","Bäumer 1991, 32-41Pinon 1995, 86–87Bäumer-Schleinkofer 1998, 144f.","Wotton, Edward‎(← links)","Wotton, Edward:De differentiis animalium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_differentiis_animalium(last revision: 25.12.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

He authored several tracts treating various theological questions and Biblical narratives usually understood within the popular doctrine ofphysica sacra. The present text reveals his approach and presents Walch's dissertation, which he apparently wrote himself (he is highlighted as itsauctorin the full title) and defended aged 21, at the University of Strasbourg in 1757. Apart from the senior administration officials in whose presence Walch disputed his work (such as the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy), the opening pages list the members of the examination committee, which included, among others, the famous Johann Bernoulli.As for the dissertation itself, it perfectly exemplifies a humanist theological tract typical for theres publica literariain the eighteenth century. It consists of 7 paragraphs supplemented with long footnotes in which Walch, for the most part, provides references to primary sources. The selection of the sources is multifarious - they contain a variety of classical authors (including poets), whose works are cited in both Latin and Greek, theological accounts, and contemporary scholarly works. In line with what was hotly disputed at the time, Walch works through one major question: was the Deluge as described in the Bible universal? Intensified in the seventeenth century in the wake of theological discussions and, later, in the eighteenth century as a result of early modern fascination with fossils, this problem permeated the whole of the theological/scientific/geological discourse of that period. To respond to this challenge, Walch first goes through a significant body of literature to demonstrate that the Deluge narrative was present across cultures. It should be noted in this respect that for Walch, the Americas and other regions outside the standardoikumenewere also subjected to the Flood. Secondly, Walch clearly echoes the contemporary quest for a geological confirmation of the Deluge's universal character. What is important is that Walch, himself a Lutheran, widely uses texts from the entire confessional spectrum, which suggests that his tract, alongside many other works concerned with the topic, exceeded the religious controversies.",,"Walch, Georg Friedrich‎(← links)","Walch, Georg Friedrich:De diluviis veterum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_diluviis_veterum(last revision: 02.08.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

This dedication is followed by a preface to the reader and 11suppositiones et definitionesbefore the main text starts.Despite promoting onlyXX modison the title page, part one (problema primum) consists of even 21 different proofs of 21 identical propositions, always formulated as follows:Parabola sesquitertia est triangoli eandem ipsi basis, et eandem ipsi altitudinem habentis(A parabolic segment is one and a third times a triangle with the same base and altitude).OnlyPropositio primaslightly deviates from this exact formulation by an intruducingQuaelibetemphasizing that this holds foranyparabolic segment. The proofs are prepared by a series oflemmata(auxiliary propositions) and accompanied by variouscorollaria(corollaries). The first ten proving methods can be considered as classical, relying on themethod of exhaustion. The proofs 11 to 21 are based on the method of indivisibles which is  announced on page 55, where it says:Quadratura parabolae per novam indivisibilium Geometriam pluribus modis absoluta. Part one is concluded by an appendix on the area of the cycloide.The second part (Problema alterum) starts with another preface and a collection of examples before the main goal is tackled: The volume of a solid which is generated by the revolution of a part of a hyperbola about one of its (rectangular) asymptotes, cut by a vertical plane, thesolido hyperbolico acuto. Onp. 115Torricelli presents the surprising fact that even though the resulting solid is ""infinitely high"", its volume is finite and equals the volume of a certain cylinder. After this theorem, Torricelli remarks that this surprising result can be easily shown by the method of indivisibles which he would consider sufficient. But he will also provide an additional proof by exhaustion in order to please all those still suspicious about the new method.  The second part is concluded by another appendix on the volume of a helix-like body (cochlea).The work diffused quickly and was studied by mathematicians likeWallis,BarroworLeibniz. Torricelli did not justify the new idea of indivisibles apart from references to the authority of Cavalieri'sGeometria. But he did promote it, on the one hand by presenting the rich possibilities for finding areas and volumes, the 11 different proofs of the area of the parabola serving as a kind of palette of techniques. On the other hand it is shown that it can be used to find many new and astonishing results like the one of the rotated hyperbola. So both demonstrating the solidity of the method on known terrain and then going beyond may be the reason for Torricelli's success with this work.","Alexander 2014, esp. 104-117Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008vol. 13, 433-440Mancosu 1996, 130-139",Arithmetica infinitorum‎(← links)Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum promota‎(← links)Exercitationes geometricae sex‎(← links),"Torricelli, Evangelista:De dimensione parabolae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_dimensione_parabolae(last revision: 02.05.2022).",(e-rara versionhttps://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-4238is missing some pages),,Yes,FB,

This long-unpublished piece was Brahe's inaugural oration, which he delivered in front of Copenhagen professors and students in 1574, when he started to teach mathematics at the university.Brahe begins by praising mathematics as the science which surpasses all others in terms of its charm, beauty, certainty, truth, and the abundance of insights it offers. He divides mathematics into geometry and arithmetic, from which numerous other mathematical disciplines derive, most of all astronomy. Indeed, the science of the stars is at the heart of the text. After a short praise of geometry (pp. 6–8) and an even shorter one of arithmetic (p. 8), Brahe already turns to astronomy, which is praised in a much more lavish way (pp. 8–15). According to Brahe, astronomy (whose present state is credited toPtolemyandCopernicus) is the mathematical discipline par excellence: ancient, noble, and sublime, befitting human nature and human purpose. The praise of astronomy then segues into an emphatic vindication of astrology against scientific and theological objections, which is the actual focus of the oration. Eighteen out of twenty-eight pages are dedicated to the defense of the discipline, presenting it as a valid and pious mathematical science (pp. 15–32). At the end, Brahe informs his audience about the topics of his mathematics course.The oration remained in manuscript during Brahe's lifetime and was printed only after his death in Copenhagen in 1610 (there is no generally accessible digital copy of this first edition).

Dio Chrysostomus: Εὑρέθη ἡ Μουσικὴ θεραπείας ἔνεκα τῶν ἀνθρώπων τῶν παθῶν, καὶ μάλιστα μεταστρέφειν ψυχὰς ἀπηνῶς καὶ ἀγρίως διακειμένας.",,1734,Leipzig,Martini,18th century,Monograph,"Physics, Medicine, Other (see description)",De effectibus musices in corpus animatum(Google Books),740095,"When Johann Wilhelm Albrecht, professor of medicine in Erfurt, published his treatiseOn the Effects of Music on the Ensouled Body, he tapped into a topic that had garnered lively interest in the medical community and had been treated in a number of medical dissertations in the seventeenth and eighteenth century (cf. the 1706 Wittenberg dissertationDe curatione morborum per carmina et cantus musicosand the 1714 Leipzig dissertationDisputatio effectus musicae in hominem). In the preface to the reader, Albrecht shows himself aware of the existing literature, but is confident that there is room for a new contribution. His declared intention is to bring together the physical, anatomical and medical findings of the best authors in such a way that the tie between the nature of sound, the anatomy of hearing, and the effects of music on the afflictions of the mind becomes apparent.In the treatise itself, Albrecht explains that he is convinced that the many stories about the healing and soothing properties of music are not pure fiction, since everyone experiences them today when listening to elegant pieces of music. Therefore, he started to look for the physical explanation of its wonderful effects (§ 11). While the author is not a practical musician himself (which would have been useful, as he admits), he nevertheless embarks on the topic, which has been neglected because most musicians do not know physics well enough and the other way around. While Albrecht stresses in the preface that his work is not a practical guide to the composition and performance of music suited to the different states of body and mind, in the treatise, he expresses the hope that his work will feed back into the musical praxis: the more expert musicians can build on the theoretical principles laid out in the book and thus enhance their art (§ 12).The treatise is 136 pages long and divided into 319 numbered paragraphs, which vary in length between one line and one page. The page titles provide basic orientation in terms of content, fulfilling the same function as marginal headings in other publications. The explanation of the different emotions and mental dispositions is based on the traditional humoral pathology. The text draws from a wealth of ancient medical and literary sources in Greek and Latin (e.g. Homer, Hippocrates, Cicero, Aelianus) as well as early modern (scientific) texts in Latin, French and German (e.g. Herman Boerhaave, Michael Praetorius, Bernard de Fontenelle). The examples of the effects of music likewise range from Achilles playing the lyre in theIliadto the musical treatment of the tarantula's bite (in this section, Albrecht relies on Giorgio Baglivi'sDe anatome, morsu et effectibus tarantulae).The Latin is simple and elegant, though fairly technical. In direct quotations, Greek sources are often cited in the original (in most cases with a Latin translation), but sometimes only in Latin translation (e.g. Hippocrates in § 214, Plutarch in § 264). Albrecht also quotes sources in French, arguing that a Latin translation would not have the same force as the original (§ 260) or that readers would rather read the quote in French than in Latin (§ 267). In the case of some specialist non-academic vocabulary, Albrecht first renders the term in Latin, but also provides the German equivalent in brackets (e.g.instrumentorum musicorum superior tabula[Resonanzboden] in § 93).The layout of the print is neat and simple. The literary paratext consists of a Greek motto on the title page, a short letter of dedication to Albrecht's teacher Georg Erhard Hamberger and a two-page preface to the reader. Albrecht's treatise did not see a second edition, but it was referenced both in eighteenth-century medical (e.g. in thesecond volumeof Anne-Charles Lorry'sDe melancholia et morbis melancholicis, Paris 1765) and musical literature (e.g. Johann Mattheson and the Erfurt musician Jakob Adlung).","Kümmel 1977(on music and medicine, with a few references to Albrecht's treatise)Frömming 2015, 23 (with the above-mentioned examples of reception)","Albrecht, Johann Wilhelm‎(← links)","Albrecht, Johann Wilhelm:De effectibus musices in corpus animatum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_effectibus_musices_in_corpus_animatum(last revision: 29.10.2021).","Rough structure of the text: (1) the introduction, including the definition and history of music, the aim of the work, a critique of science and a general overview of the effects of music in humans and animals (§§ 1–34), (2) the nature of sound (§§ 35–111), (3) the anatomy of hearing (§§ 112–192), (4) an overview of the different afflictions (§§ 193–223), (5) the various effects and uses of music (§§ 224–318) and (6) a closing paragraph (§ 319).Notes on the text§14-26: interesting critique of science/scientific publishing§14: Illud primum ideo est necessarium, ne rei non existentis investigemus causas.

"Scaliger, Joseph Juste",Iosephi Scaligeri Iuli Caesaris filii opus novum de emendatione temporum in octo libros tributum.,,1583,Paris,"Estienne, Patisson, Mamert",17th century,"Tables and charts, Encyclopedic work","Mathematics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography, Other (see description)",De emendatione temporum(Google Books)Alternative link:MDZ,831540,"During the late 16th century many works on chronology were created, e.g., by Melanchthon,Mercator, Funck (Chronologia), byCrusius(Liber de epochis) orCandidus(Tabulae chronologicae). Two main branches of chronology are to be noted: the humanistic and the systematic approach. Whereas the former digs into ancient texts and tries to temporally align certain historical events, the latter makes use of astronomical tools in order to compute a chronological order.Scaliger, a learned humanist, stands out for combining these methods in theDe emendatione temporum. The starting point of his interest in chronology is a debate on the ethymology of the name “April” which Varro derived from the verbaperio, as in the springtime of April, nature opens. But Scaliger remarks that this cannot be true for linguistic, but even more due to the 10-months Romulean year: This short year resulted in cycling months through the seasons. Scaliger's trials to compare various lunar and solar years by means of computation founded his increasing interest in the topic, especially as he did not come to satisfying solutions easily. On this way he revealed that antique sources were sometimes not only incomplete and vague, but also contradicted each other. Scaliger used arithmetics but had some difficulties – typical for a humanist chronologer of the time, as Grafton (Grafton 1985, 111) points out. As Scaliger has not studiedPtolemy, profound knowledge of astronomy and calendars is lacking. Instead he used first the standard text book of Samotheus (Opusculum de emendationibus temporum). Later he discovered the systematic chronologies by Funck who brought biblical events into order using astronomy in hisChronologia, and byCrusiuswhose astronomical data inLiber de epochiswas based onErasmus Reinhold’sPrutenic tablesand whose use of eclipses for resolving chronological questions became one of his major inspirations. After some five years of dedicating himself to chronology, in 1583,De emendatione temporumwas published in Paris.Its title page bears the printing sign with an olive tree and the motto “noli altum sapere” of Robert Estienne, the father of the departed first husband of the printer’s Mamert Patisson’s wife. A dedication letter to Achille de Harlay, the first president of the Parliament of Paris is followed by someprolegomenato the reader, a well-arranged table of contents and two poems, one in Latin and one in Greek.
The work proper consists of eight chapters (called “books”), where the first four deal with historical and modern calendars, various lunar and solar years and their conversion. They contain technical prose as well as helpful tables. Scaliger cites antique sources, deals with Roman and Greek calendars or Babylonian months, and frequently changes from Latin to Greek or Hebrew script. Books five and six assign Julian dates to important historical events, where half of the sixth book is dedicated to dates of Jesus' life. Book seven is on the computus, and how it is carried out in various “nations”. Among them there is one of the Ethiopian church, written in Geʽez script, transcribed and translated. The last book, finally, is on calendar reform – a highly topical question of the time due to the Gregorian reform in 1582.Although Scaliger had only “a gifted amateur’s knowledge of the field” (Grafton 1985a, 130), hisDe emendatione temporumwas novel in many respects: For it not only combined astronomy, oriental studies and classical philology which constituted a new model for future chronologers; it also lacked something which is even more revealing – any attempt to assign meaning to the data (Grafton 1985a, 131). When Scaliger’s predecessor had tried not only to sort out the past but also to give meaning to it, to find a “divine plan” in it and thus to predict the future, Scaliger’s own work is devoid of such ideas. As a Calvinist, he could thus escape from religious questions, stick to facts and initiate a paradigm shift in chronology: “Dates […] are dates, not lessons” (Grafton 1985a, 134).","Grafton 1985aGrafton 1983–1993, vol. 2: Historical chronology, esp. 145–360Nothaft 2012, esp. ch. 8",Liber de epochis‎(← links)De aequinoctiorum anticipatione diatriba‎(← links)Tabulae chronologicae‎(← links)In Manilii quinque libros Astronomicon commentarius et castigationes‎(← links),"Scaliger, Joseph Juste:De emendatione temporum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_emendatione_temporum(last revision: 17.11.2021).",Posthume Ausgabe:De emendatione temporum(E-rara),FB,Yes,FB,

The work contained numerous short texts allegedly of Etruscan origin but mostly written in Latin. They were primarily concerned with Italian prehistory; some were prophecies. In addition, many illustrations depicted inscriptions in illegible characters and strange objects. Inghirami claimed to have found the respective texts in hollow balls made of hair and some kind of glue and calledscarith(a pseudo-Etruscan word) on his country estate at Scornelli near Volterra. In a letter to the future finder the ancient author called himself Prosperus Fesulanus and claimed to have hidden thescarithwhen his castle was under Roman attack in the aftermath of the Catilinarian conspiracy. In fact, Inghirami had fabricated this entire material himself a few years earlier with the help of his younger sister Lucrezia – a practical joke of two teenagers. Thescarithmade their author-editor famous but also sparked a heated debate about their genuineness (Rowland 2004).One year after the publication of theFragmenta, the Olivetan monk, mathematician and astronomer Vincenzo Renieri entered the battle on the side of the defenders. He set out his ideas in anAstronomical Inquiry into the Fragments of Etruscan Antiquities,  a short monograph of twelve quarto pages, which features no paratexts except the title. The work is cast in the form of a letter to Renieri's sovereign Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who, like many of his subjects, thought thescarithto be genuine out of patriotism. After some general reflections on the relationship between time and truth (pp. 3–4), Renieri reveals that he has found a way to demonstrate the authenticity of thescarithwith the help of two astronomical passages reported at pp. 3 and 272 of Inghirami's work. The first of these speaks of a conjunction of Venus, Saturnus and Aldebaran, the second, of a lunar eclipse occurring together with a conjunction of Venus and a star called Arthon (pp. 4–5). Renieri first shows that the common dating of the birth of Christ, established in the 6th century by Dionysius Exiguus, is off the mark by two years, so that the end of the Catilinarian conspiracy fell, not in 62, but in 60 BC (p. 5). He then demonstrates that the aforementioned astronomical events did indeed take place 60 years before the birth of Christ (pp. 6–9). As a corollary, he provides an exact date for the burying of one specificscarith(pp. 9–10). Returning to his previous astronomical argument, Renieri reasons that the respective texts, even if forged, must be at least 200 years old, since they were found embedded between the roots of an old oak. On the other hand, the precise data and astronomical skills necessary to calculate the exact positions of stars and planets a long time ago are a very recent achievement. It follows that the respective passages published by Inghirami must be contemporary with the astronomical situation they describe (pp. 11–12). At the end of the treatise, some other objections raised against the genuineness of thescarithon account of their writing material (linen), their style and the name Prosperus are countered (pp. 12–14).Renieri’s epistolary treatise exhibits a curious mixture of up-to-date mathematical astronomy on the one hand and strong humanist, antiquarian and patriotic interests on the other. The text is peppered with quotations from Inghirami and ancient literature. At one crucial point, Renieri resorts to a daring emendation to get what he wants: the star Arthon becomes Greek ἄρθρον (árthron), supposed to mean ""conjunction"", p. 8). The astronomical data are given in the form of tables, which are grammatically integrated into the text, but set apart typographically (pp. 6, 8, 9). Since the data are derived from Renieri’s ownTabulae Mediceae(1639), his small monograph also acts as an advertisement of this forthcoming work. The lunar eclipse in question is visualised in a diagram. Renieri writes in long, syntactically complex periods, which makes the argumentation hard to follow but underlines that he is not just an accomplished mathematical astonomer, but also a well-educated scholar in the classical sense: some extra symbolic capital to be thrown into the discussion.",Rowland 2004,"Renieri, Vincenzo‎(← links)","Renieri, Vincenzo:De Etruscarum antiquitatum fragmentis disquisitio astronomica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_Etruscarum_antiquitatum_fragmentis_disquisitio_astronomica(last revision: 16.09.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Nifo's text is a response to Johannes Stoeffler's famous almanack in which through the use of the theory of ""great conjunctions"" Stoeffler sought to predict the calamity. As is well known, the publication of Stoeffler's almanack caused reactions across Europe, with numerous scholars questioning the very idea that the Deluge or similar events of significant importance produced by God's will could be astrologically proven. Nifo, who at the time was considered one of the leading natural philosophers in Italy, was among such authors.The treatise represents Nifo's good knowledge of contemporary astrological debates, especially with regard to the so-called Ptolemaic astrological tradition. Critical ofGiovanni Pico della Mirandola'sDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricemsince as Nifo claims it was inspired by Girolamo Savonarola and promoted Savonarola's ideological agenda, at the same time Nifo adopts Pico's polemical strategy according to which Ptolemy should be considered separately from his Islamic commentators. Claiming that Ptolemy's calculations had been distorted and misunderstood within the astrological tradition, Nifo eventually denounces the theory of great conjunctions as invalid. Nifo's approach perfectly illustrates the quest for ""pure"" authorities and the intention to go backad fontesthus getting rid of subsequent and often false interpretations - something that was typical for his contemporary fellow natural philosophers including, for instance, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola orNiccolò Leoniceno.",,"Nifo, Agostino‎(← links)","Nifo, Agostino:De falsa diluvii prognosticatione, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_falsa_diluvii_prognosticatione(last revision: 17.11.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

The author points to his brothers research on theususof snow, i.e., the preceding publicationDe nivis usu medicoby Thomas Bartholin, before mentioning authors who have described and/or studied snow more thoroughly: Olaus Magnus (designatas), Kepler and others (examinatas), Descartes (demonstratas). 
At this point of the introduction, Bartholin turns to the intention and the content of his dissertation: It is to show and examine a few features which are inconsistent with common every-day observations, but which can be seen quite frequently; Bartholin’s intention is not only to describe these shapes of snow(flakes), but especially to present the topic to a broader public.The monograph's first part (pp. 5-7) is about various snowflakes, the second part (pp. 7-12) contains deliberations on the deficits of classical explanatory models for the generation of snow, the third part (pp. 12-17) stresses the important role of chemistry, mathematics and empiricism, the fourth part (pp. 17-31) presents various empirical experiments, demonstrations and questions about natural forms, the fifth part (pp. 31-40) describes different forms of snow, especially the six-cornered one, the sixth part (pp. 41-42) again stresses the primacy of mathematics.Generally speaking, the text follows, on the one hand, the traditional (Aristotelian) ideas, but, on the other hand, clearly emphasizes the importance of empirical approaches and especially mathematics. Bartholin, e.g., thinks “that the shaping of six-pointed stars resulted from contacts between an organized array of globules.” (Mason 1966, pp. 48–49)Unlike mostdisputationesabout snow and ice – which were mainly printed between 1640 and 1700 –, Bartholin's monograph experienced immediate reception. Interestingly, Georg Kaspar Kirchmaier mentions Bartholin’sdissertatioin his 1659Disputatio publica de nive(Wittenberg), although the first edition of Bartholin’s text was printed in 1661 (Copenhagen). The information in the text’s preface might offer an explanation for the two-year gap: The author dedicates the 1661 edition of theDe figura nivis dissertatioto his older brother, Thomas Bartholin (1616–1680). According to the dedication, Thomas had asked his younger brother to publish the dissertation. Because of itsmediocritas, the older brother should be free in his deliberation, i.e., whether to publish or to hold back the dissertation.In fact, Bartholin’sDe figura nivis dissertatiowas published as an attachment to Thomas’De nivis uso medico, where Thomas Bartholin collects knowledge about snow and snowflakes and advertises his brothers monograph (cf. chapter V) which might have been written a few years earlier.",,"Bartholin, Rasmus‎(← links)Disputatio publica de nive‎(← links)Appendice IX au traité des couronnes et des parhélies‎(← links)De nivis usu medico observationes variae‎(← links)Disquisitio physica de nive‎(← links)De nive dissertatio secunda‎(← links)Observationes philologicae de nive‎(← links)","Bartholin, Rasmus:De figura nivis dissertatio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_figura_nivis_dissertatio(last revision: 18.11.2021).","Introductory section (1-5):(1) With reference to Arnobius, Bartholin points out a certain arduousness in describing the various causes for the shapes of snow(flakes) – snow is not only, as Arnobius says, (“plumea”), but also “hexagona”, “stellata”, “rosacea”, “rotata”. (2) Bartholin briefly describes (in a similar way as Kepler did in his “Strena”), the geometrical and star-shaped patterns of snow(flakes). Snow would definitely belong to the “summa orbis miracula”, if it were not apparently devaluated by its “familiaris conspectus” in daily life. Bartholin then stresses that the fugacity of snow should not deflect one’s mind from the glory of its creator (“artifex”), insofar as the barbaric human mind admires especially what is within the “corporum amplitudine”, but seldom notices other things that may also comprise big grandeur (“virtutes”) not derived only by their size. The author now quotes Virgil (“in tenui labor at tenuis non gloria”) (Verg., Georg., IV, 6) and says that the snow’s (underestimated) “humilis figura” might well influence everyday life. (3) Only “mathesis” is able to properly describe snow and its occurrences: its shapes on glass, how huge atmospheric masses are contracted et cetera – A “naturae mystas”, e.g., can describe how air contracts in water and how snow is formed; the “mystas” might also conduct various other experiments on snow: Here, (4) the author points to his brothers research on the “uses” of snow, i.e., the preceding publication “De Nivis Usu Medico” by Thomas Bartholin, before mentioning authors who have described and/or studied snow more thoroughly: Olaus Magnus (“designatas”), Kepler and others (“examinatas”), Descartes (“demonstratas”). Bartholin interestingly states that he observed countless different shapes of snow(flakes), whereas, according to him, all the other authors reduced these countless shapes to a few categories of regularly and/or irregularly formed snowflakes (plumae, flocci, villi, stellae plumatae & rosatae & rotatae); likewise, the other authors stuck especially to the hexangular form, whereas Bartholin himself says to have observed pentagonal snow(flakes), as well as others, according to him, observed octangular snow(flakes) – this is, in fact, physically impossible, because snowflakes without exception possess the hexagonal crystalline structure of ice. Presumably, Bartholin refers to fragments of snowflakes and/or to accumulated snowflakes which might appear in different forms than the substantial hexagonal structures (cf. p. 5-7). (5) At this point of the introduction, Bartholin turns to the intention and the content of his dissertation: It is to show and examine a few features which are inconsistent with common every-day observations, but which can be seen quite frequently; Bartholin’s intention is not only to describe these shapes of snow(flakes) – following, e.g., Descartes –, but especially to present the topic to a broader public (“veritas… cunctis innotescat”).---First part (5-7): 
Description of various snowflakes, frequently observed by Bartholin in Belgium and Denmark, especially in a winter night in early January 1660.
-> On figure “C” (cf. appendix, p. 43, fig. 1, C): This structure is formed by the superabundance of the “flocci” on the singular spoke-like axes (“radii”).
(6) -> On figures “B” and “D” (cf. appendix, p. 43): These structures are also hexagonal, but characterized by a central concentration (figura “D”) resp. a central white star (figura “B”), both do not have bunches (“villi”) at their pointed ends. 
-> On figure “A” (cf. appendix, p. 43): A small white (and apparently fragile) “stellula”, often carried by the wind.
-> On figure “H” (cf. appendix, p. 43): Another sexangular structure, with distinctive (cross-like) globules on the ends and a (quite eye-catching) central star.
-> On figure “F” (cf. appendix, p. 43): A sexangular structure, formed by six quite substantial globules on the ends; a very fragile structure in the center.
(7) -> On figure “K” (cf. appendix, p. 43): On another “species nivis” with six globules and a seventh “corona stipans”, somehow squeezing into the middle.
-> On figure “E” (cf. appendix, p. 43): A pentagonal structure; Bartholin apparently tries to describe the fragment of a six-cornered snowflake which has only one five remaining bare “radii” (of which only one is intact).
On another “species nivis” with six globules and a seventh “corona stipans”, somehow squeezing into the middle.---Second part (7-12):
Deliberations on the deficits of (classical) explanatory models for the generation of snow 
In this part, Bartholin investigates explanatory models; firstly, he refuses the idea that snow is generated accidentally (8); secondly, he stresses the importance of the Mathematics: For quite some time the mathematics has offered a better explanatory model, but it might have been damaging for someone’s reputation to deviate from the inherited philosophical explanations; instead, it seemed much easier to rely on previous explanatory models, “quas in mille casuum informitatibus opinionibus relinquimus.”
This important passage is followed by a short summary of Aristotle’s meteorology, which is described as only a good starting point for a general understanding (“generalis cognition”) (9). It is noteworthy how Bartholin tries to connect the scholastic approach to more contemporary ones, though resting upon the classical explanation: However, the general Aristotelic model is not satisfactory for a more thorough investigation of the various causes for the generation of snow and should be upgraded.
Here, Bartholin mentions explanatory models such as: 
a) magnetism (cf. Athanasius Kircher, Pierre Borel): One example: In his “Observationum microscopicarum centuria”, Pierre Borel (cf. obs. 92) writes: “Nivem sexangulam, rosiformem et variis aliisque figuris iuxta varios dies efformatam distinxi, inque illis villis se mutuo secantibus, quasi magneticum, quo se ex una parte et non ex alia coniungunt.” – 
b) “ideas generationis” (Johannes Marcus Marci) – 
c) a kind of air (“anima”) (William Davison in his “Philosophia pyrotechnica”) – 
d) a certain “virtus formatrix” (Niccolò Cabeo in his commentary on Aristotle’s meteorology).According to Bartholin, these four explanatory models for the formation of snow lack a certain clarity (e.g., questions remain: “quae sit vis illa magnetica”, “in quo haec idea consistat”, “quomodo agat anima virtusque formatrix”) and are not better than the ones claiming a certain unknown and hidden cause.
Likewise, the idea of a certain agitation of the spirits/winds – Bartholin considers this idea somehow closer to the truth (10) – is seen skeptically, because it lacks explanations on the reasons for the agitation as well as on the way the agitation takes place; this also applies to “geometrical” explanations: They cannot explain the reasons for the formation of geometrical patterns etc. 
Bartholin compares his deliberations on the question in dispute with the understanding of a complex clockwork: if its mode of operation were only be explained by a “certain power” (“facultas quaedam”), caused by the “summus artifex”, this of course would not be wrong, but this answer, at the same time, could not remove the remaining doubts. The same problem applies (11) for descriptions of the very nature (“materia”) of the mentioned power (“facultas”): Whereas both its “materia” in general and its “efficiens” in particular can be explained, its initiating cause (“causa effectrix”) must remain obscure. And as a true Mechanic would not be happy with partial explanations of a complex clockwork and might not be able to repair a broken clockwork, one might not be happy with only a partial explanation of the meteora and their interrelated movements. Before turning to the next segment, Bartholin adds a similar, much shorter example about a physician (who needs to understand the bodily functions resp. systems).---Third part (12-17): 
On the important role of chemistry, mathematics and empiricism as explanatory models
Bartholin states that chemical experiments can be useful for his purpose, adding examples of regular designs (“figurae regulares”) observed in nature: crystals, aluminium, natron, salt, “congelations”, “in vegetabilis” (13), in leaves and flowers, fruits (e.g., pomegranate), animals (e.g., bees and spiders) resp. their extremities. Bartholin states that all these forms can be traced back to mechanical reasons and that their figural variety depends on their particular substance (“materia”). At this point, when it comes to questions on their concrete shape (“ubi de figura certatur rebus”), the mathematics (“haec Musa”) is helpful: 
Bartholin states that the biggest philosophical problems (14) can be solved if every phenomenon “in rerum natura” is explained by the motions of the matter, its allocation and its division – as an example, he describes the formation of the clouds (following the Aristotelic theorem); subsequently, he lists other examples (e.g., milk, whey, butter, cheese).
Experience shows that some phenomena are in apparent conflict with sensual perception (“in sensui obviis”), and the same difficulty applies to phenomena unseizable by human senses (15) as to phenomena so minor that they elude the imperfect human senses, e.g., the eyes.
But with the help of auxiliary tools (e.g., glasses), new findings are possible, for example about the size of the smallest particles not visible to the human eye (not even with the best tools available). The author then agrees with the assumption that everything is made up of “minutissima corpora”; based on this assumption, it then seems necessary that the “corpora” (i.e., presumably: whole bodies composed of parts united) as a whole are shaped according to the influencing categories “concursus”, “motus” and “quies”. At this point, “in explicanda natura”, Bartholin sees no necessity in further pursuing ambiguous terminological questions (16); instead, the author points to the following section where he aims to explain that the various forms and shapes “necessarily” result from “mathematical necessities”. 
In a short passage, Bartholin describes the circular and spherical forms as the most efficient ones, especially because they possess the smallest surface. It is an universal truth (and needs no further proof), that this very simple form is favored by nature (e.g., drops) etc., and it is also true that animals follow their natural instincts in this matter. 
(17) “All” authors also agree that bees build hexagonal combs; according to Pappus of Alexandria, bees are a part of the reason behind the formation (“rationis participes esse credat”; N.B.: In a similar way, Kepler assumes that bees possess a certain mathematical reasoning, given the comb’s similarity to cristals), what Bartholin considers as too far-fetched. Their dwellings are, of course, hexagonal; at this point, the author leads over to the description of an empirical experiment on bees, in order to connect (conveyed) experience with (experimental) experience. 
---Fourth part (17-31): 
Various empirical experiments, demonstrations and questions about natural forms
In his section about the “experimentum de Apibus”, Bartholin describes an empirical experiment, namely the construction of a beehive with a vitreous back side, enabling the observer to witness (18) how the combs are constructed. Bartholin argues that bees construct the combs as circular structures – whereas modern observations have falsified this theory, it was common in contemporary texts.
In order to prove his assumption about the circular form of combs, Bartholin adds a second “demonstration” (“demonstratio figurae hexagoneae favorum”); he describes the various mathematical possibilities of arranging as many peas (or other round objects) as possible on a minimal surface. To emphasize his deliberation (19), the author points at the dissertation’s short appendix (cf. appendix, p. 43, fig. 2) and describes in extenso how the animal movements impose pressure (20) upon the circular structures, gradually tightening the round structures and stiffening the spaces between at the same time (21). To a certain extent, this construction method also saves resources, and it seems as if form followed function: “They keep out of the hives the drones, an indolent bunch.” – As already on page 2, Bartholin quotes Virgil (Georg., IV, 168), then (in extenso) Kepler (De nive sexangula) and Varro (De re rustica).
The next passus (Aranearum tela qua re hexagona) tries to explain, why spider webs are formed in a hexangular pattern. According to Bartholin (22), animals simply look for the easiest way and form, which is why spiders choose the hexangular form for their webs. The hexagon is seen as the most similar to a circle; and due to their symmetry, hexagonal webs are easier to build than, e.g., pentagonal or heptagonal forms. This is not only because of the spider’s creative genius, but rather because of the material’s character. In fact, it is known today that spider webs are not necessarily (or even usually) hexagonal, but they do have an angular structure that can sometimes resemble a hexagon.
“Consequently” (“consequens est”), Bartholin now wants to continue (23) with the investigation of the remaining influencing factors (“regularia”). It is described how all matter is distributed according to movements inherent in the matter, e.g., if globules are cast, water is poured, if different trees grow into many shapes, but still following common principles or a superior force. This passage is reminiscent of Kepler’s “facultas formatrix” (cf. Kepler 1611).
Bartholin now adds his description of various alchemistic experiments he conducted, e.g. on a so called “Diana's Tree” or “Sylva portatilis” (experimentum arboris vegetabilis) (24): He describes a dendritic amalgam of crystallized silver, obtained from mercury in a solution of silver nitrate.
Bartholin then (26) names and describes more examples of naturally formed regular structures (figurae regulares quomodo in naturalibus fiant); the author, e.g., refers to an experiment conducted with pig’s liver, then points to Descartes’ oeuvre, adding various observations, also referring to Kepler and Cabeo. (27-30); the last observation in this section is about star-shaped structures in minerals.---Fifth part: (31-40):
On different forms of snow, especially on the six-cornered form
In the fifth section of the text, Bartholin finally turns to the discussion of four different forms of snow(flakes) (“Demonstratio figurarum Nivis”), which he re-identifies as “scopum praefixum”. Firstly, Bartholin points to Descartes’ Meteora as a starting point for his studies.
In the following sub-chapters, Bartholin analyses four different manifestations of snow, beginning with “round” forms, continuing with “hairy” and “flat” forms, finally ending with a more detailed description of six-cornered forms. 
1)	Firstly (32-33), snow obtains a round shape (“nix figuram rotundam accipit primo”); this depends on certain (mild) weather conditions. 
2)	Secondly (33-34), snow is described as somehow “hairy” (“quomodo pilosa”); this form also depends on certain weather conditions (in general, it must be colder, and the formation process is longer).
3)	Thirdly (34-36), Bartholin writes in some detail that “flat” snow (quomodo plana fiat”) can turn into a nearly endless number of different – irregular – shapes; certainly, at the same time, he stresses that the hexagonal shape deserves more attention.
4)	Fourthly, (36-40), Bartholin describes the sexangular snow (“quomodo hexagona fiat”). Interestingly, this chapter’s type size is a bis smaller.
As in the first part of the monograph, the author refers to Descartes and Olaus Magnus, but does not explicitly mention Kepler. However, Bartholin’s last observation seems closely attached to Kepler’s “De Nive sexangula”. Whether the concluding observation is a reference to Kepler or a mere coincidence respectively a by-product of the author’s empirical deductions and deliberations, cannot be fully deducted from the text. In either case, it seems certain that Bartholin knew Kepler’s “Strena” well, but it is not always easy to distinguish which parts refer directly to Kepler. 
Bartholin also points at the dissertation’s short appendix (cf. appendix, p. 43, fig. 2)
---Sixth part (41-42):
Conclusion about the primacy of mathematics 
A pictured rejection of the astrologers and their explanations: Bartholin invites them to restrain themselves from the heavens and says that they should no longer aspire at “stardom” in the lower spheres (“qui astra vanis cogitationibus petitis”). Instead, they should turn their attention to the higher spheres, i.e., the milky way and its brighter stars. In contrast, the lower spheres belong to the opticians (41), and the geographers (42), and the mathematicians (42). Philosophers should acknowledge that the mathematics can offer better explanatory models than elaborate word constructions.---Seventh part: Appendix (43)",UK,Yes,UK,"Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek: M.med.76"

Although in secondary literature it is usually associated with the question of flow and ebb to which Grisogono significantly contributed, it, in fact, consists of a larger number of notes on astrology and medicine. According to its title, it is mainly divided into three main parts, with only the third one dedicated specifically to the flow and ebb phenomenon. The other portions are for the most part concerned with medical applications of astrology and, as Grisogono states himself, with happiness that good predictions bring to our life. The main body of the text deals with quite traditional topics of contemporary astro-medical debates: the ways to predict and cure pestilence, so-called ""critical days"" of illnesses, a topic widely debated at the time in medical intellectual circles etc. In Part 2, Grisogono goes through the concept of happiness. Grisogono eliminates the Aristotelian understanding of happiness as bliss and criticises Aristippus and Epicurus for deducing happiness to the physical goods; happiness here appears as the purpose of human life associated with the Platonic understanding of good as knowledge. He states that only with the use of knowledge individuals reach bliss. Establishing a link between knowledge and bliss is Grisogono’s attempt to establish astrology as the supreme discipline. He goes on to note that philosophy is astrology’s “maid” and underlines the superiority of astrology in order to justify its importance to natural philosophy, medicine and ethics, i.e. achieving happiness and bliss.Finally, in Part 3 Grisogono investigates the flow and ebb phenomenon, which he attributes exclusively to the position of the Sun and the Moon. Providing quite a detailed account of the daily, fortnightly and annual cycles of the tides, he also accompanies his booklet by a set of concentric card disks, one fixed and two free to rotate about the centre - this, in turn, allowed the calculation of the relative positions of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun.

Although the present dissertationOn the Natural Variety of the Human Racewas defended and published over twenty years after Haller left Göttingen in 1753, it clearly is Hallerian in spirit. That the publication followed upon the disputation (cf. thedisputavitin the full title) instead of announcing it and serving as its basis, as was customary, may indicate that it took Blumenbach longer to complete the work than he had planned.Blumenbach's preface to the reader (pp. 1–4) provides an excellent example of enlightened scientific ethos.

He justifies his copious footnotes, which indeed can fill up more than half of a page, with his desire to document his debts to his predecessors and with the possibility given to the reader to control the author's claims and delve deeper into the theme. Blumenbach also asserts that he does not want to have the last say, but rather to enable further research.The dissertation itself is written in the grammatically classical, terminologically pragmatic Latin adopted by most 18th century scientific authors. It starts from a discussion of procreation and hybridisation (pp. 5–19), followed by an account of the differences between man and other animals, esp. the great apes (pp. 19–39). After that, Blumenbach’s core question is formulated (pp. 39–40):Sinte fuerintve omnis aevi omnisque gentis homines unius eiusdemque diversaeve plane speciei.(""If humans of all times and of every people belong to one and the same or to completely different species."") While many have promoted the second alternative out ofmalitia, negligentia et novitatis studium(""meanness, negligence and novelty craze""), Blumenbach himself will presentargumenta mea pro unica saltem humani generis specie merisque eius varietatibus(""my arguments that there only is one species of the human race with mere varieties""). Following Linnaeus'Systema naturae(10th ed. 1758, pp. 20–22), Blumenbach defines four varieties (pp. 41–42), but delimits them a little differently (yet another classification will be advocated in theDecas collectionis suae craniorum). His first subspecies inhabits Europe, Asia west of the Ganges and north of the Amur plus the northernmost parts of America, the second, southeast Asia and the Pacific islands, the third, Africa, the fourth, the rest of America. However, these varieties have fluid transitions and merge into one another; Blumenbach even reduces them to a mere construct adopted as a mnemotechnical aid (memoriae tantum subsidium; today, by the way, Homo sapiens is no longer assumed to have any subspecies at all). In the following, the varieties are first described in terms of bodily constitution, stature and complexion (pp. 42–58), then, with regard to the single parts of the body, in particular the head (pp. 58–77). Next (and somewhat surprisingly), albinism is discussed and it is stated, against earlier writers, that people suffering from it are still human beings, not beasts (pp. 77–91). Finally, stories of mythical hybrid creatures, especially of caudate men, are debunked with a combination of historical, philological and even art-historical arguments (pp. 91–96). The book is rounded off by two tables of illustrations.Not only the biological approach to anthropology, but also the outlook of this dissertation with its detailed argumentation, its ongoing engagement with previous research and its massive footnotes strikes one as thoroughly modern. On the other hand, the book rather represents an earlier, humanist brand of science in that its biological argument is largely conducted by philological means. This bookish approach and lack of first-hand experience will later appear as the greatest defect of his juvenile opus to Blumenbach himself:Imprimis vero eo vitio laborare libellum agnovi, quod in eo conficiendo fere unice ex libris sapere mihi licuerit, as he puts it on p. 4 of theDecas collectionis suae craniorum.",,"Blumenbach, Johann Friedrich‎(← links)Decas collectionis suae craniorum‎(← links)","Blumenbach, Johann Friedrich:De generis humani varietate nativa, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_generis_humani_varietate_nativa(last revision: 18.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In a letter toJohann Michael Fehrfrom 1 May 1658,Philipp Jacob Sachs von Lewenheimbeasily enumerates a dozen examples (Kefalas 2015, 70–74). More often than not, such works were written from a medical point of view. This is also true of the presentMedical Exercise about the Herringby the physician Paul Neucrantz from Rostock. He wants to defend the ""prince of fish"", as the herring is called in the full title, against allegations of being  an unhealthy food.The booklet, which comprises some 90 quarto pages, all in all, is dedicated to the three reigning consuls of Lübeck in a one-page ellogium. The first chapter continues the dedication by explaining how the book was occasioned by a discussion at a wedding banquet in which the author and the dedicatees took place. Neucrantz' work transmits the substance (but does not keep the form) of this discussion. The remainging paratexts are relegated to the end of the volume: a postface (pp. 82–83) in which shortcomings of the work are excused with the author's many other obligations, especially his practice, an epigram of five elegiac couplets to the author by a friend, and – something unusual in this kind of writings – an index comprising over 200 entries.The treatise itself is divided into 15 chapters. They follow one another in less than stringent order and discuss the following topics:1. Introduction (see above, pp. 3–6)2. The herring was unknown to the ancients (pp. 6–13)3. Its way of life, habitat, and subspecies (pp. 13–22)4. It whistles but does not breathe (pp. 22–25)5. It does not subsist on saltwater only (pp. 25–28)6. Boiled herring (pp. 29–35)7. Arguments for the herring's excellence (pp. 36–40)8. Its wonderful taste (pp. 40–42)9. Its flappers and flakes as signs of excellence (pp. 43–45)10. Fried herring (pp. 45–57)11. Arguments against the herring's excellence reviewed and refuted (pp. 48–55)12. Salted herring (pp. 55–70)13. Smoked herring (pp. 70–75)14. The herring as medicine and other uses (pp. 75–78)15. The herring is the prince of fish (pp. 78–81)TheMedical Exerciseis at least as much a cultural as a natural history of the herring. One finds little on the appearance, build, and anatomy of the fish, and biological questions, such as how often per year it mates (pp. 18–19) or how many different kinds of herring exist (pp. 19–20), are discussed but rarely. More space is given to culinary, medical, and economical considerations. The final chapter which sums up the various aspects of thebonitasof the herring dwells on issues such as its use as lenten fair for Catholics, the bodily and moral training provided by deep-sea fishery, and the fish's taste.Neucrantz' text is peppered with numerous citations and quotations from ancient, medieval, and early modern literature, including many Greek authors, given in the original, as well as an unusual amount of Arab medical writers. Remarks on blind whales from Aelianus (p. 14), moralizing passages from Ambrosius (pp. 16–17), and the assertion that the herring's flakes are a sign of excellence because fish with flakes is named as a legitimate food in the Old Testament (p. 43) alternate with letters to the author from Nicolaes Tulp which provide some up-to-date information. The way Neucrantz parades his sources obviously underlines the learned character of his work but also its digressive train of thought. (How the author indulges his ideas in writing is well captured on p. 22 where the description of a fish similar to the herring is introduced by the remarkdum haec scribo, subit animum recordatio piscis …, ""while I am writing this, the memory of another fish comes to my mind …"".) Neucrantz' own experience is invoked but rarely, for instance on p. 55 where he remembers having given his ten-year-old daughter herring during a fever.The style is generally well readable. However, sentences are often interrupted by long strings of citations as well as by other parentheses (e.g. p. 43), another indication of Neucrantz' associative way of writing.",,De monocerote seu unicornu‎(← links),"Neucrantz, Paul:De harengo exercitatio medica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_harengo_exercitatio_medica(last revision: 17.01.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It deals with the so-calledHerba mimosaorHerba sentiens, that isMimosa pudica. This plant is able to react to even light touches by folding its leaves inward and reopen again after a certain time. This seemingly peculiar phenomenon attracted the attention of many European botanists (“[...] iucundo suo phaenomeno spectatores afficiat et detineat”; p. 3) once they became aware of it (the plant naturally grows in South America). A sensitive plant that is able to quick movements seemed to contradict common (Aristotelian) philosophy as sensitivity and self-movement are typically attributed to animals. In 18 chapters on 20 pages, Mauchart discusses the different names of the plant (or rather plants as he highlights that there are different species), its taxonomy, physiology, etc. He cites a great number of renowned botanists such asJohn Ray,Caspar Bauhin, Jacob de Bondt,Willem Piso, Caspar Schott,Simon Paulli, and many more. The text offers ample information, but the style of writing is not very elegant. Mauchart applies a nominal style and uses manytermini technici.

"Theophrastus,Gaza, Theodorus",Theophrasti De historia plantarum,,1483,Treviso,"Confalonieri, Bartolomeo",15th century since invention of printing,"Translation, Encyclopedic work",Biology,De historia plantarum(MDZ),668519,"The present Latin translation of Theophrastus'Historia plantarumconstitutes theeditio princepsof this botanical text, whose Greek original was published only in 1497. Together withDe causis plantarum, which follows it in the same volume, it provides a botanical counterpart to Theodorus Gaza'sDe animalibus, his translation of the zoological writings of Theophrastus' teacher Aristotle. Both publications present a collection of some closely connected works by a Peripatetic author dealing with one clearly defined discipline, both are dedicated to popes and feature an introduction emphasizing the difficulties of the translation process (see below), both were printed posthumously, but still within the incunabula era, and both proved highly successful. Like the animal books, the botanical works were regularly republished over the following centuries. At several occasions, both were included in the same volume.Gaza's translation of Theophrastus comprises some 300 folio pages, roughly half of which are filled by the ten books of theHistoria plantarum(of book ten, only a few sentences survive). The text is introduced by a flattering letter to pope Nicholas V. (reg. 1447–55), which praises the pope's zeal to have Greek classics translated into Latin and indicates that Gaza undertook the translation at his order (fols. A ii r–v). This is followed by apraefatio(fols. A ii v–A iiii v) in which Gaza talks about his job as a translator. According to him, translation in general is a difficult enterprise, and a translator must be philosophically educated. Gaza finds it harder to translate out of his native tongue Greek into Latin than vice versa. Theophrastus' botanical works are a particularly tough nut to crack, because there exists no comparable  Latin work from classical antiquity, Latin's botanical vocabulary is much poorer than the Greek one, and the only manuscript at Gaza's disposal is badly corrupt. After the end ofDe historia plantarum(fols. A iiii v–K vi r), there follows a letter by the humanist Giorgio Merula, who saw Gaza's work through the press, to the Venetian patrician Dominicus Sanutus (fol. K vi v). Merula praises Gaza's skills as a translator, defends him against accusations regarding his use of rare words and states that he himself has added a table of contents to each of the two works. These tables, which are quite elementary and feature no page numbers, follow immediately (fols. L r–L vi v), before the tome is concluded byDe causis plantarum(fols. a r–k vi r).Gaza renders Theophrast's terse and dry Greek into fairly elegant Latin prose, freely expanding the expressions of his model to bring out the sense more clearly. At the same time, it becomes evident at every turn that his initial complaints about the difficulties of his task must be taken seriously. A glance at the first dozen lines or so of book six (6.1–2 in modern editions), where Theophrastus announces his ensuing treatment of undershrubs and herbs, suffices to illustrate this point. In this short passage, two serious problems are easily identified. Firstly, Gaza is confronted with a string of four plant names for which he has no Latin counterparts and which he therefore transliterates asserpyllum, sisibrium, beleium, abrotanum(in all but the last case, the transliteration is imprecise, which presumably indicates that the plant names in Gaza's Greek manuscript were somewhat misspelled as well). Secondly, having announced that he will first discuss wild kinds, Theophrastus comes up with a statement which is printed as follows in modern editions:Ἔστιν αὐτῶν εἴδη καὶ μέρη πλείω, ἃ δεῖ διαιρεῖν καὶ τοῖς καθ᾿ ἕκαστον γένος καὶ τοῖς ὅλοις εἴδεσι.Gaza renders this puzzling and probably corrupt sentence asHorum igitur species partesque plures cum singulis generibus tum totis speciebus existunt; quas utique discernamus oportet.This is every bit as hard to understand as the original. The implication thatspeciesshould be divided intogeneraseems bizarre. γένος (accusativ singular) becomesgeneribus(ablative plural); perhaps Gaza's Greek text differed from modern editions at this point. The attempt to take the relative clause ἃ δεῖ διαιρεῖν (quas utique discernamus oportet) as independent from the following is almost certainly misguided. Gaza presumably failed to see any sense in the original and tried to reproduce at least all the words and the grammatical structure in the vague hope that his readers would be able to make some use of the result. In this as in many other cases, the difficulties he faced were simply unsurmountable – and often have remained so until today. The current Loeb translation, produced on a much better manuscript basis (cf.Einarson 1976for the tradition) and with of all the tools of modern philology, renders the passage in question as""Of these are several classes and sub-divisions, which we must distinguish by the characteristics of each sub-division as well as by those of each class taken as a whole.""Such sense as this seems to make rests on the impossible assumptions that the ""sub-divisions"" are initially called μέρη by Theophrastus but γένος a few words later and that the expression εἴδη / εἴδεσι changes its meaning from ""classes"" to ""characteristics"".",Short description of the translation and of one particular copy,"Gaza, Theodorus‎(← links)Theophrastus‎(← links)","Theophrastus; Gaza, Theodorus:De historia plantarum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_historia_plantarum(last revision: 17.05.2021).","NB: Theophrastus'Historia plantarumis not a historia in the sense in which the word is used in this database. In contains description of plants, sometimes longer series of these, but on the whole, they are integrated into an account of plants and their properties in general. Nothing like an exhaustive inventory of plants seems to be attempted.NB: With Gaza, we have the case of a Greek who should have little problems with the language of origin. He also has mastered well the Latin (his letter to the pope is quite elegantly styled).
Preface by Gaza: translation as difficult, worthwhile, philosophical (distinction linguistic form / content; addo etiam imponendorum nominum aptam inventionem, quae … philosophia<e> profecto opus est). Easier and more convenient for G. to translate into Greek than Latin. Difficulty of Theophrastus and his vocabulary. No corresponding Latin author. Pliny’s errors in this respect.

As it is the case with many dissertations, it does not become clear from the print whether the dissertation was written by thepraesesAdam Brendel or by therespondensJohann Gottfried Oertel.De Homero medicoconstitutes the interesting example of a serious scientific engagement with ancient poetry, showing that literature and science were still far from being separate entities at the end of the seventeenth century (cf. also thecommentary on theOdysseyin this database).Neatly structured into 18 numbered chapters, the dissertation begins with a panegyrical introduction that praises medicine, emphasising its noble ancient origins. When asserting Homer's medical knowledge, the author of the dissertation finds precursors in Pliny the Elder, Galen and Plutarch (chapter III). The assessment of the medical content ofIliadandOdysseyfollows the division of medicine in preserving health (chapter V–IX), curing illnesses (chapter X–XIV) and minorministraesuch as surgery and pharmacy (chapter XV–XVIII). While in the chapters on preserving health, the author focusses mainly on eating and drinking (for example, the epitheton αἶθοψ [aithops] is interpreted as referring to the hot quality of wine), the chapters on curing illnesses show a particular interest in Achilles's melancholy and music therapy (Achilles plays the lyre inIliad9). At this point, the only notable digression into post-antiquity is inserted: a detailed and vivid description of tarantism and its cure through music (chapter XIII). In a short chapter on air (XV), the author draws on the famous vacuum experiments (experimenta Boyliana et Florentina) to explain, among other things, why Ulysses was right in sulphurising the hall after murdering the suitors inOdyssey22.In each passage, Homer's correct medical judgement is confirmed by a medical explanation that is supported by meticulous quotations of other ancient authors in Greek or (less frequently) in Latin. The author of the dissertation never disagrees with Homer or ancient medical authorities (he does oppose Plutarch's interpretation twice, but confirms his judgement both times by comparing Plutarch's views to contrasting opinions of Hippocrates and Pliny respectively).

The work was probably written before hisDiscours de la méthode, but only published after his death, the first edition being a Latin translation of the originally French text by Florentius Schuyl (Leiden 1662), before the French version was published by Claude Clerselier (Traité de l’homme, Paris 1664). Clerselier noted that in the manuscript in his possession, the treatise was called ""chapter XVIII"" ofLe monde. The two editions were widely read and commented upon and the work made its way in the 19th century edition of Cartesius'Opera omnia, edited by F.G. Levrault (vol. 4, 1824), in the French version. The Latin edition was re-issued in 1664, in 1677 and in 1729.Descartes presents an anatomical treatise with a metaphysical background: He sets out to describe the functions and mechanics of the human body, but additionally, he includes the role of the human mind. The work begins with his controversial statement that human body and soul are separate and need to be treated separately, before the connection between them can be explained. This leads the author to his fundamental opinion that bodies are essentially machines and can be compared to automata, especially the hydraulic automata which were en vogue in his time. For this purpose, the author starts with an explanation of the blood circulation in the body, as it had been just recently presented in William Harvey'sExercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis, and especially in the brain, where the connection between body and soul/mind lies. Descartes goes on to elucidate the nervous system, comparing the impulses of the nerves (spiritus animales) to water which spreads throughout the whole body and inflates the muscles and causes muscle contraction and deflation. The impulse for all this, for thespiritusto make their way through the body, is given by the brain, and more specifically the pineal body, which in Descartes' opinion represents the connection between the automated, material body and the immaterial soul. 
The work is accompanied by a letter to the reader of no less than 32 pages, which includes comments and notes by Louis de la Forge, a physician and proponent of Cartesianism (cf. his own workTractatus de mente humana) and by many images, almost all of them provided by the editor Schuyl, as Descartes' manuscripts did not include images to illustrate his text, even though it constantly referred to such illustrations. 
Descartes' mechanistic take on the human body and his opinions on the immaterial human soul or mind were disputed heavily throughout the 17th and in the 18th century still. Apart from critical letters, treatises, commentaries and such, some Jesuit opponents found creative ways to critizise him, in satirical Latin texts, where the question of human and animal automata did play a major role (e.g. Pierre de Coedic'sMundus Cartesii; Gabriel Daniel'sVoiage au monde de Descartes, which was translated into Latin:Iter per mundum Cartesii).","French text only inŒuvres de Descartes, vol 4René Descartes  Le Monde,  L’Homme,  Introduction de Annie Bitbol-Hespériès, textes  établis  et  annotés  par A.

The De hortis Hesperidum runs from folio s iir to u viiv. This posthumous edition was the first set of neo-Latin didactic poems to appear in print.The poem is both an emulation of, and extension to Vergil's Georgics. The ancient author had left a mention of the citrus tree at II. 126-132, upon which Pontano was able to expand with knowledge of the cultivation of citrus in Campania, which had not existed in Vergil’s time. Typical for whatHaskell 1999calls this type of ‘recreational georgic’ from the Italian Renaissance is the use of Ovidian-style myths (on which seeLudwig 1982). In Pontano’s De hortis Hesperidum, he has the goddess Venus turn her dead lover Adonis into the citrus tree. Similarly characteristic of the poetry written in the georgic style during this period in Italy (Vida’sDe Bombyceand Milio’sDe hortorum culturawould be another two well-known examples) is the preference for cultivated nature over raw natural forces as underlined inHaskell 1999.","Soldati 1902Ludwig 1982, 151–180Haskell 1999, 132–159","Pontano, Giovanni Gioviano‎(← links)","Pontano, Giovanni Gioviano:De hortis Hesperidum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_hortis_Hesperidum(last revision: 28.06.2021).",BeckianumDie zitierte Erstausgabe hat auch die beiden anderen Lehrgedichte.Ein Abschnitt aus Buch 1 befasst sich mit der Anlage eines schönen Gartens uns ist überschrieben „De opere topiario“!,MK,Yes,WB,

By della Porta's time, physiognomy based on the tradition, which dated back to Pseudo-Aristotle'sPhysiognomicaand its numerous subsequent interpretations, was considered as a legitimate discipline even despite several attacks on it in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century scientific literature.In his writing divided into four books, della Porta develops his experimental method first presented in theMagia naturalis. Della Porta's approach is based on what he considers to be experimental evidence about the correlation between a person's face and their personality. This determines the way in which he presents his material: the main body of the text is divided into small detailed chapters on particular features of physiognomical knowledge, usually with corresponding images, which are supposed to support della Porta's explanation. While the first book is on the history of physiognomy and abounds with references to Aristotle and the physiognomical tradition, the rest of the treatise deals with three major themes (namely, human face, eyes, and the relation between one's character and physiognomical features) and is structured accordingly. Each book is preceded by a short introduction in which della Porta summarises the book's content and goal. In general, the treatise is an attempt to provide an extensive and (proto)-scientific interpretation of physiognomy.
Della Porta expanded the argument on the use of physiognomy throughout his career. After 1586, he composed several treatises on the physiognomical topics not covered in theDe humana physiognomonia. These include thePhytognomica(1588), theCoelestis physiognomonia(1603), and thePhytognomica(written in the 1580s but published posthumously in 1677). Della Porta's work became quite successful and was frequently republished during the 17th century. His scientific approach to physiognomy influenced his contemporaries' investigations in the field including these of Sir Thomas Browne and ""the father of modern physiognomy"" Johann Kaspar Lavater.",Paolella 1996;Balbiani 2001;Agrimi 2002;Verardi 2017,"Della Porta, Giambattista‎(← links)","Della Porta, Giambattista:De humana physiognomonia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_humana_physiognomonia(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,,Yes,OA,

Die Alten dagegen, welcher Schule sie auch angehörten, pflegten alle drei Teile der Medizin, die Diätetik, die Arzneimittellehre und die Chirurgie, gleichermaßen. Die Modernen haben Angst, nur als Handwerker zu gelten, wenn sie sich mit Chirurgie befassen. Das beeinträchtigt nicht nur die Leistungsfähigkeit der Medizin entscheidend, sondern schadet auch der Kenntnis der Naturkunde. Akademische Sektionen (sofern sie überhaupt stattfinden) bieten heute ein trauriges Schauspiel: Der gelehrte Arzt spricht, der tonsor schneidet, keiner versteht eigentlich, was passiert. Jetzt, wo mit den übrigen Künsten auch die Medizin einen Aufschwung nimmt, will deshalb auch ich mein Scherflein beitragen usw. In Paris, Löwen und Padua habe ich mir umfassende Erfahrung aus erster Hand erworben. Die literarische Tradition zur Sektion hängt ganz von Galen ab, der aber selbst nie einen Menschen, sondern nur Affen seziert hat. Mein Buch folgt der Ordnung, in der ich die Menschen selbst im Unterricht zu sezieren pflege. Inhaltsangabe der sieben Bücher. Meine Bilder sind ein großartiges Hilfsmittel, was immer meine Kritiker sagen mögen. Sie sollen Sektionen nicht ersetzen, sondern dazu anregen. Meine Jugend (28 Jahre) macht mich anfällig für die Kritik ignoranter Greise. Der Kaser möge deshalb das Werk beschützen. Bei seiner Liebe zu den Wissenschaften wird er das auch bestimmt tun. Weitere Lobpreisungen des Kaisers wären unangebracht.How dear the book was to its readers can be seen from the digital copy, whose initial parts have been beautifully coloured and decorated with floral motives.

The author, a physician and professor at the university of Padua and student ofFabricius ab Aquapendente, Hieronymus, wanted to complement and augment Vesalius' work with the new knowledge acquired in the decades since the publication ofDe humani corporis fabricain 1543. The work was published posthumously byDaniel Bucretius, who dedicated it to the  Venetian DogeGiovanni I Corner. In addition, an address by the physician and friend of Spiegel, Liberalis Crema, offers it to the Venetian physicians and connects it to previous anatomical works, e.g. by Niccolò Massa. The title page is inspired by previous anatomical treatises, especially Vesalius' works. It shows Anatomia sitting on a throne, holding a human skull in her hand, flanked by the personifications of diligentia and ingenium. A naked human body, a human skeleton, as well as a monkey and a boar symbolize knowledge through dissection/vivisection of humans and animals. Images of several anatomical instruments complement this picture. In a letter to the reader, the editor Bucretius indicates that Spiegel had given the work to him before passing away to be published. He recommends the text for its useful pointers for chirurgs, its explanatians for problematic passages in ancient authorities like Hippocrates, its new knowledge on  human anatomy, not found in Galen or Hippocrates, especially its new method of dissecting the human brain. The text is accompanied by many detailed anatomical tables by Julius Casserius.Spiegel closely followes Vesalius in the structure of his anatomical work: Book 1 is concerned with the names, shape and proportions of the external parts of the body, book 2 with the bones, book 3 with the cartilages and ligaments, book 4 with the muscles, book 5 with the veins, book 6 with the arteries, book 7 with the nervous system, book 8 with intestines and genitals, book 9 with the heart and lungs and book 10 with the brain and sensory organs. 
Spiegel's work was reissued in Frankfurt in 1632. In 1645, his collected works were printed in two volumes in Amsterdam. The first volume included major anatomical works after Spiegel, namely Gaspare Aselli's De lactibus sive lacteis venis (1627), William Harvey'sExercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis, and Johannes Walaeus'De motu chyli et sanguinis(1640).",,"Spiegel, Adriaan van de‎(← links)","Spiegel, Adriaan van de:De humani corporis fabrica (Spiegel), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_humani_corporis_fabrica_(Spiegel)(last revision: 13.12.2021).",,JL,Yes,JL,

Around 1800, the often already resembled modern scientific papers to a remarkable degree. This is also the case with the articleOn the Nature and Properties of the Gas Arsineby the renowned chemist Friedrich Stromeyer.The text comprises some 30 pages densely packed with information. After a brief introduction including an overview of previous research, eight paragraphs discuss the production of arsine (§ I), its general properties (§ II), its behaviour with water (§ III, including a chart that exhibits the results of a number of eudiometric experiments) and a number of other substances (§ IV), its deadly effects on breathing animals (§ V), its behaviour with air and oxygen (§ VI), different acids (§ VII) and salts (§ VIII). In the final paragraph, the results of Stromeyer's research are summarised in 16 points. His account is entirely descriptive. Stromeyer refrains from any reflections on the structure of matter that could underlie the properties of arsine elucidated by him.As already insinuated, the article has a modern look in several respects. Earlier pertinent literature is referenced in the body text and in a number of footnotes. The Latin respects the rules of classical syntax, but is totally uninhibited by classicistic considerations when it comes to the lexicon. Unclassical technical terms are freely used and coined, which results in a chemical terminology that closely resembles the present one and is readily understandable to a modern chemist. The following description of the production of arsenic acid from arsine, for instance, hardly needs a translation (p. 153):Itaque 200 gas hydrogenii arseniati partes adhibitae 111,5 gas oxygenii partes combustione absorpserunt atque 56,45 milligrammata acidi arsenicosi produxerunt.In descriptions such as this, the terminology emancipates itself, so to speak, from the natural language in which it is embedded – a process that greatly facilitated the replacement of Latin as language of science by various vernaculars from the 18th century onwards.The aforementioned introduction not only summarises the state of the art. Together with the title, it also gives some information about the circumstances from which the text originated. Having been elected a member of the Göttingen Royal Society of Sciences, the author felt the pressure to justify his membership by producing a decent piece of science (a topos recurring in many introductions to texts such as the present one). Having chosen a theme from the still sketchily known reactions of hydrogen with metals, he presented his findings as a talk at the Society's meeting on October 12th, 1805.

The treatise consists of 18 short chapters, in which Telesio goes through the effects vapours and sediments have on various aspects of meteorology. Telesio claims that sediments depend on the position of the Sun with respect to a specific geographical zone, in which they occur. He uses this explanation to stress the central position of his natural philosophical system according to which the whole variety of natural things originates from a permanent confrontation between the two active forces, heat and cold. Pushing his vision of what constitutes the driver for natural change, Telesio distances from Aristotle's teaching on nature in two other instances. First, Telesio adapts the Epicurean understanding of the origin of earthquakes claiming that vapours provoke the subterranean motion, which, in turn, results in earthly tremors. Secondly, he firmly objects Aristotle's interpretation of the formation of winds. Unlike Aristotle who believed that winds emerge in the wake of rains through vapours, and based onhistoria, Telesio dismisses the strict correlation between the events and goes on to say that in order to explain the generation of winds one should take into account a larger number of factors, including, for instance, general humidity in a place and its geographical location.In terms of its style, the treatise is a rather standard philosophical text of the time, albeit structured as a series of short, in most cases one-page-long, theses, with no elaborate arguments.

(As a much later example, one may compare Johann Jakob Scheuchzer'sPhysica sacra, 1731–35.) The dedication to Philipp II of Spain justifies the author's endeavour with the argument that the result may be imperfect but will invite others to do a better job. The proem explains that the Bible is of course not a textbook of natural history, but that its statements pertaining to that discipline are nonetheless true, since they are inspired by the Allmighty. For this reason, the author, who has taught natural philosophy for many decades, wants to dedicate his last years to the natural philosophy of the Bible.The body of the text consists of 91 chapters, each of which treats a problem raised by a biblical passage, starting with Genesis and concluding with Apocalypse. How should the account of the Creation be understood (ch. 1)? Can a man become blind by the feces of a swallow and regain his eyesight later, as narrated in Tobit 2 (ch. 42)? What does Job 38,Per quam viam spargitur lux, dividitur aestus supra terram?, tell us about the nature of light (ch. 53)? Questions like these are discussed at length. In doing so, Valles makes extensive use of the natural philosophical tradition as well as of more recent scientific findings.A second edition (Lyon 1595) shows that the work was a success.

As some studies have suggested, an idea to write a Latin treatise, which he perceived as a major summary of his cosmology and philosophy of nature, came to Bruno in England and, in a way, became the result of hisperegrinatio philosophicaand evencredo. The Frankfurt edition of Bruno's Latin writings consists of three texts: theDe monadesummarises his mathematical-metaphysical investigations, theDe minimodeals with mathematics and geometry, theDe immensopresents his views of physics and cosmology. This reveals that Bruno conceived the Frankfurt edition as a unified and well-structured single book.TheDe immenso, which by length exceeds the two other writings, is composed in the form of prosimetrum and exploits a combination of prose and verse parts. At the same time, unlike many other examples of the genre known since antiquity (see, for instance, Boethius'sConsolatioor Bernardus Silvestrus'sCosmographia), Bruno's writing has two important features. First, while Bruno's prose Latin has a flavour of the philosophical language and, therefore, is not quite easy to catch due to its philosophical content, the verse Latin is extremely complex and presents a difficult challenge for both readers and potential editors of the text. This, in turn, explains the absence of a modern critical edition of theDe immenso. The second feature is that prose parts do not necessarily comment on respective verse passages. The particular way to structure the material makes theDe immensoa fascinating example of a single-book self-commentary in the Renaissance. In this respect, a book that resembles Bruno's writing in terms of its structure is Biesius'sDe universitate libri tres.","Fiorentino et al. 1879–1891, vol. 1, part 1+2 (edition of the Latin texts)Monti 1980, 415–809 (Italian translation, the verse parts are translated in prose)Granada; Tessicini 2020","Bruno, Giordano‎(← links)De monade‎(← links)Ad Iordanum Brunum‎(← links)","Bruno, Giordano:De immenso, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_immenso(last revision: 08.01.2022).",,"OA, IT",Yes,OA,

It was printed in the same year with a praefatio and his own notes to his lines. The preface states his long-lasting wish to emulate the ancient poets in composing a poem about philosophical and scientific topics and the strategies he implied when writing about ""dry"" topics such as mechanics, scientific instruments etc.After an introduction, in which a physicotheological aspect of the poem becomes apparent, as God and his creation are praised, and an invocation to God as the creator of all things, van der Eyk goes on to narrate the beginnings of the earth, starting with its creation and presenting the fate of the ancient empires and their ingenious philosophers and scholars, mentioning i.a. Homer, Virgil, Thales of Milet, Euclid, and drawing a line to early modern scientists such asEulerandNewton. 
The author then treats inventions, e.g. mills or the cataracts in his Dutch homeland, as well as discoveries of the last centuries, such as air pressure, praising physics and mathematics as the finest subjects, and famous scholars from Galilei to d'Alembert, for they made this revolutionary developments possible. The poem sometimes jumps from one topic to the other, one section treating nautical inventions such as the nautical compass, before turning to the the art of painting and sculpting, to architecture.As the author states in his preface, he strives to make dry topics more ecxiting, e.g. giving a long-winded description of the horrors of war when introducing the invention of gunpowder, and ending this description with a short eulogy of emperor Napoleon. 
One section is concerned with the developments in the field of medicine and chemistry, but also mentions Benjamin Franklin's discovery of electricity, discoveries in the field of meteorology as well as of the microscope. A short part on geography and geology follows, then a longer section on astronomical phenomena, before another praise of God as the creator of all things closes the poem.Van der Eyk often addresses the muses as inspiration as well as God and from time to time includes mythological stories or artificial myths in his accounts.

"Moffett, Thomas",De iure et praestantia chymicorum medicamentorum dialogus apologeticus auctore Thoma Mufetto Londinate Anglo. Accesserunt etiam epistolae quaedam medicinales ad medicos aliquot conscriptae,,1584,Frankfurt am Main,Wechel,16th century,"Letter, Dialogue","Alchemy/Chemistry, Medicine",De iure et praestantia chymicorum medicamentorum(Google Books),608637,"This workOn the Right to Exist and the Excellence of Chymical Medicationsby the English doctor Thomas Moffett is an interesting contribution to the heated debate about Paracelsus' attempt to put medicine on a chymical fundament. (On ""chymical / chymistry"" as an adequate label for the early modern unity of alchemy and chemistry, seeNewman; Principe 1998). The book is introduced by a dedication to Peder Soerensen (Petrus Severinus), personal physician to the Danish king, prominent Paracelsist and author of an influential treatise titledIdea medicinae philosophicae(1571) (pp. 3–8). The ensuing letter to students of iatrochemistry (pp. 9–12), who are addressed ascarissimi fratres, informs them that Moffett sees himself forced to write and publishOn the Rightby the insolence of some Galenists, especially by an anonymous opponent simply called ""Antiparacelsista"". Should Moffett's work hurt his adversaries, that would only be in line with the way an efficient medical cure works.The work is a peculiar combination of a dialogue (pp. 13–60) and five letters (pp. 61–111). The dialogue is dramatic (that is, it lacks a narrative frame), involves two participants and takes place in an unspecified city. One speaker, Ch(ymista), apparently stands in for the author himself, the other, Ph(ilerastus) (""Friend of [the fervid anti-Paracelsian Thomas] Erastus""), is a young Galenist. As he reveals in an opening monologue, Ph. plans to feign interest in iatrochemistry in order to involve Ch. in a discussion and to refute his opinions. The kind-hearted Ch. lets himself beguile by Ph.'s protestations (pp. 13–20). He invites him into his house, where Ph. has to undergo a kind of initiation: Taking a bath and changing his dress, he symbolically frees himself of unfounded opinions and prejudices. Ch. also exhorts Ph. to speak up freely (pp. 20–23). In the main part of the dialogue, the young doctor receives a guided tour through Ch.'s laboratory. In accordance with Ch.'s invitation toparrhesía, Ph. voices a series of doubts and objections, all of which are promptly invalidated by Ch. Among other things, the neglect of chymistry by the ancients is explained by the primitive state of the then medicine, the darkness of chymical designations defended with the need to keep out the uninitiated, and life defined as the ability to act: in this sense, medications from all three realms of nature can be said to live within the human body. Conventional and chymical medications complement each other, but the latter are more potent by far. All natural substances are impure, but may be purified by chymical processes. That even minerals can be efficient drugs, if correctly prepared and administered, is demonstrated by examples such as quicksilver (pp. 23–59). At the end Ph. admits his initial bad intentions and confesses that he has been convinced of the superiority of iatrochemistry. He is renamed Philalethes by Ch. and allowed to stay in his house as a disciple. For the moment, Ch. himself has to go on a journy to see an important patient who lives far away. He will counsel Ph. by mail, if the latter has any doubts (pp. 59–60).Accordingly, the dialogue is followed by five letters by Ch., which are dated London (Moffett's place of residence at the time) 1582–84. Letters 1–4 are addressed to Philalethes and continue the narrative begun in the dialogue. The first two are prompted by a request for advice how to counter certain attacks of a litigious Galenist. The third deals with the question whose authority a new doctor should follow in the first place. In the fourth and longest letter, Ch. explains that he himself follows no human authority, but the ""light of nature"" (naturae lumen, p. 86). The fifth letter contrasts with the others and has no direct connection to the rest of the volume. It addresses a certain Endymion Luddipolensis (""Sleeper from Luddipolis""; the toponym may stand for London, seeHouliston 1989, 238), who believes he can become a doctor whilst comfortably staying at home, but is exhorted to travel instead.While Ch. is an auctorial figure, as already mentioned, the work's reader should identify with Ph. and reenact his conversion. The text is ostentatiously learned, presumably in order to counter the widespread impression that Paracelsism and iatrochymistry are just ignorant quackery. The language is full of technical terms both from medicine in general and from iatrochymistry, such asenecatus Mercurius(""quicksilver killed"", that is, rendered harmless, p. 55). Whole recipes are quoted from sources unknown. Greek passages abound, and medical classics are referenced in marginalia. Ch. alias Moffett is particularly proud of his expertise in this field, which on several occasions allows him to demonstrate that the opinions of the Galenists can actually be refuted from Galen's own writings. Despite its learned nature, the work, and its dialogic part in particular, makes for an entertaining read due to its fluent style, the interplay of dialogue strictly speaking and background action (for instance, in the initiation scene) and the spirited polemics from both sides. To the use of mineral medications by the iatrochymists, for instance, Ph. objects as follows (pp. 48–49):Vidi enim aurum, coralla, margaritas, smaragdos, carneolos, hyacinthos aliosque pretiosi generis lapillos tusos coctosque phthisicis non plus profuisse quam si vitrum devorassent aut silicem.(""For I have seen that gold, corals, pearls, emeralds, carnelians, amethysts and other precious stones ground and cooked were no more helpful to people suffering from consumptiveness than if they had swallowed glass or flintstone."")Moffett's work caused quite a stir, especially on the continent, were it was first printed. It was enthusiastically welcomed by many iatrochymists, but also vigourously attacked by Johannes Crato von Krafftheim. A little later,On the Rightwas included into Lazarus Zetzner'sTheatrum chemicum(first ed. 1602). Over the following decades, it was repeatedly quoted by renowned authors such as Andreas Libavius.","Houliston 1989, esp. 237–240","Moffett, Thomas‎(← links)","Moffett, Thomas:De iure et praestantia chymicorum medicamentorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_iure_et_praestantia_chymicorum_medicamentorum(last revision: 09.04.2021).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

De latere Christi aperto,"Georgii Wolffgangi Wedeli, medicinae doctoris, consiliarii et archiatri Saxonici, theoretices professoris publici, Exercitationum medico-philologicarum decas tertia, 1–6",1687,Jena,"Bielcke, Krebs",17th century,"Monograph, Commentary","Medicine, Other (see description)",De latere Christi aperto(Google Books),668521,"Towards the end of the 17th century, Georg Wolfgang Wedel, professor of medicine at Jena, published a series of 13 booklets, which he titledExercitationum medico-philologicarum decas prima, secunda, etc. (First, Second, … Collection of Ten Philological-Medical Exercises; seeMaclean 2019, 87). The single exercises could in fact be called very short monographs. Each of them covers a couple of pages and discusses one specific topic in which philological and medical aspects are combined. This mix appears strange to the modern reader, but was natural enough in the early modern era, when a doctor usually had completed a humanist, largely philological curriculum before his medical studies and often had occasion to reflect on the exact meaning of a passage in Galen or Avicenna. Despite its comparatively late date, Wedel's collection provides a good example of medical philology and of the early modern interpenetration of science and humanism in general.The third volume opens with anexercitatiothat is in many ways typical of Wedel's approach. In particular, it exemplifies an early modern interest in scientific issues in the Bible and more specifically in medical aspects of the crucifixion. Wedel scrutinises the meaning a famous biblical passage about the dead of Christ, John 19.34: ἀλλ' εἷς τῶν στρατιωτῶν λόγχῃ αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευρὰν ἔνυξε, καὶ εὐθέως ἐξῆλθεν αἷμα καὶ ὕδωρ. (""But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."") The short treatise starts from some remarks concerning the fruitfulness of reflections on the Bible, after which the passage from John is quoted; minor variants in the Greek original and the Latin translation may indicate that Wedel quoted from memory (p.1). In the main part of the text, the sentence is analysed more or less word for word by means of a series of questions (pp. 1–5): Why did the soldier stab Christ with his spear in the first place? What kind of spear was it? Where exactly did it pierce the body of Jesus? (Not on the right side, as usually assumed, but on the left, because the soldier presumably was right-handed; approximately between the fifth and sixth rib). Which part of the body did the blood and water flow from? (From the heart, which was perforated by the spear.) The text ends with an assertion and definition of the miraculous nature of the phenomenon (pp. 5–6): Although Jesus was already dead, his blood had not thickened yet. Blood and water flowed out, although there was no heartbeat to propel them. The two liquids did not mix in the process.Wedel's combination of medical and philological expertise is apparent in his argumentation throughout. He can be sure that it was not only the pericardium that was wounded, since this does not contain enough, and only watery, liquid (p. 4). To justify his interpretation of ὕδωρ as lymph, he invokes the word usage of Hippocrates (p. 5). The common assumption that Jesus was wounded on his right side is made explicit in the Aethiopian version of the Gospel (p. 3). Wedel's opinion that the wound has to be located in the thorax is bolstered by the Persian version, in which the spear penetrates into the body ""under the armpit"" (sub axilla, p. 4). In addition to his considerable learning, Wedel also proves himself to be an attentive reader and interpreter. In order to justify his assumption that the wound did indeed reach the heart, for instance, he vividly imagines the whole scene and pays special attention to the character and mood of the soldier:Ubivis enim prae oculis esse debet furibunda et contumeliosa vulnerantis actio …(""We must always have before our eyes the furious, malicious action of the man who inflicted the wound …"", p.4).Wedel's style oscillates between clinical precision in the description of anatomical details and rhetorically amplified pathos where the religious dimension of the events comes into focus. To specify the exact meaning of the word πλευρά in the present context, a number of anatomical terms is introduced and their mutual relationship is carefully defined:Sufficit hoc loco non denotari latus in sua latitudine, pro toto laterali, saltem trunci ipsius, decursu, sed speciali ambitu definitum, contradistinctum hypochondriis verbo thoracis.(""It is enough that not the flank in its full extension is indicated in this passage, not the whole stretch of the side of the body, at least of the trunk itself, but a part circumscribed more precisely, contradistinguished from the loins by the word 'thorax'"", p. 3.) On the other hand, the soteriological dimension of the passion is highlighted by anaphora, tricolon and paradox:Haec mortis signis, mortis tam dirae, tam infamis, tam acerbae, signa salutis exhibet.(""Through the signs of death, of a death so terrible, so shameful, so bitter, the passion shows us the signs of salvation"", p. 1.)",,"Wedel, Georg Wolfgang‎(← links)","Wedel, Georg Wolfgang:De latere Christi aperto, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_latere_Christi_aperto(last revision: 14.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

At the same time, it harks back to ancient models such asGalen'sDe libris propriisand Augustin'sRetractationes. BesidesGirolamo Cardanowith hisLiber de libris propriis, one of the first early modern writers to resuscitate this form was Conrad Gessner. This is perhaps no accident, since Gessner broke new bibliographical ground with hisBibliotheca universalis, too. (Whether he was in addition inspired by Cardano is difficult to tell.) HisLetter about the Books Published by Himself, written in 1562, is addressed to an English friend of his, the divine and naturalistWilliam Turner(1509/10–1568). From Gessner's introductory remarks, one learns that the Turner had asked him for a list of his books. Gessner thereupon composed such a list and even had it printed, but only for his personal use in the case of further similar requests (fol. 20v):Quamobrem etiam typographo libellum permisi excudendum, ut si quis requirat in promptu habeam nec saepius eadem de re ad alios aque alios mihi scribendum sit posthac.The text was really published only posthumously. Together withJosias Simmler's precedingVita Conradi Gesneriand the following collection of poems occasioned by his death, it was presumably meant to commemorate the achievements of the great Swiss scholar.The bibliography proper falls into three parts: a list of 72 publications that appeared between 1537 and 1562 (fol. 20v–28v), a list of 18 works still unpublished in 1562, at whose end Gessner turns to Turner again and closes his letter (fol. 29r–30r), and a supplement (Corollarium) of works from the years 1562–1565 compiled by an unknown author, perhaps Simmler (fol. 30r–31r). The contents of Gessner's works encompass medicine, botany, zoology, philology, linguistics and more. Besides books written by Gessner himself, there are many editions, translations and even works of which he happened to have a copy for a publisher willing to print them (e.g. fol. 28v, no. 70). Short pamphlets are listed aside monumental compilations such as theBibliotheca universalisor the various volumes of theHistoria animalium. The style of the different entries varies considerably. Notes and full sentences are combined in varying proportions. The standard information given more or less comprises title, content, year and place of publication, printer, format and lenght of the respective work. However, some entries are much more meager, while others add further information on topics such as Gessner's motivations or the circumstances of publication.Indeed, among the most interesting aspects of theDe libris a se editis epistolaare the insights the work provides into the process of scholarly and scientific publishing in the 16th century. In his edition of aLexicon Graecolatinum, for instance, Gessner claims to have worked hard to expand and improve the book, but ""without my knowing and to my great surprise, the printer only incorporated a small part of my additional material, perhaps in order to have something more to add in the following editions"" (fol. 20v, no. 1). With regard to hisHistoria animalium, the author shows a clear awareness of the difference between a work to be read through and one to consult (fol. 24v, no. 37): ""The work has been composed by me not for perusal (continuam lectionem), but to be used in the way in which dictionaries are customarily used, to obtain an answer to a specific question. This has not been understood by those who have accused me as being too prolix in this work."" In entry no. 44 (fol. 26r), Gessner counsels his readers to let two shorter works be bound together, a phenomenon one often encounters in dealing with early modern books.",,"Vita Conradi Gesneri‎(← links)Gessner, Conrad‎(← links)Liber de libris propriis‎(← links)","Gessner, Conrad:De libris a se editis epistola, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_libris_a_se_editis_epistola(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

He did not make his authorship public but hid under the mysterious pseudonymM. P. E. A. S.. The treatise comprises 26 pages of classical greek-style mathematics masking Fermat's infinitesimal methods.After title page and a very short note by the printer (Typographus lectori), the work consists of seven propositions and their proofs. As the title indicates, Fermat compares segments of curved lines with tangent segments by a subdivision. This comes directly in a debate on whether curved lines can be compared with straight lines (""rectified"")at allunless this length is part of its defining properties (Mahoney 1994, 267). This had been denied by the followers ofDescartes. But Fermat bluntly – and ignorantly of recent developments – opens his book with the claim:Nondum, quod sciam, lineam curvam pure geometricam rectae datae geometrae adaequarunt(""To the best of my knowledge, mathematicians have not made a purely geometrical curved line equal to a given straight line so far""). But in fact, exactlysuch a workbyHendrik van Heuraethad been published in an appendix to the Latin version ofDescartes'Geometry.In the present work, Fermat first compares the lengths of pieces of straight tangent lines to those of a curve. Approximating this curve in two ways by these straight elements, one certainly longer, one smaller, he can squeeze the length of the curve in beetween these two values. A finer subdivision yields a result as exact as desired. With adouble reduction ad absurdum, a technique already used by Archimedes, he proves that his method derives a formula of how to proceed from the equation of the curve to its length. His method builds upon two previously developed methods, the method of finding tangents and the treatise on quadrature (De aequationum localium transmutatione et emendatione). He gives examples of curves and calculates their length.After the propositions, a problem of rectifying certain curves is posed and solved in an appendix.In the end, Fermat cannot help naming numerous of his own achievements in analysis. Due to him tangents, areas, the centers of gravity, surfaces, and many more can be now determined only by the equation of the curve.The work is endowed with several figures necessary to understand the propositions and proofs.

When the polymath Georg Caspar Kirchmaier, professor of rhetoric at Wittenberg and (as Phosphorus II.) member of the Leopoldina, was sent a specimen and asked about his opinion on the matter by the physician Carlo Amaton Tornesi, he took the opportunity to publish a short monograph on the subject, styling it as a letter to his friend Christian Franz Paullini, who had written to him several times in the past without receiving an answer. As Kirchmaier candidly admits in his dedication to Paullini, he thereby makes both Tornesi and Paullini happy and kills two birds with one stone (p. 3):Nunc quid impedit, ut apud te illumque pariter dispungam debitoris nomen et fidelia parietes dealbem una duos?To publish short monographs as letters was current practice at the time, as evidenced by the frequency ofdissertatio epistolicatitles (cf. Johann Daniel Major'sDissertatio epistolica de cancris et serpentibus petrefactis). Kirchmaier, however, handles the form in a strange (or perhaps simply clumsy) manner: although the whole work is conceived as a letter, as shown by the finalvaledictio(Vale tu et fave tuo!, p. 16), it nonetheless is introduced by the aforementioned separate letter of dedication.The short work falls into two parts. The first (pp. 4–8) deals with locusts in general, providing a definition of the animal as a ""walking, jumping, and flying insect, buzzing and chirping, voracious, rambling, extremely detrimental, particularly for the pastures"", which is then discussed and exemplified in all its parts, and adivisio, that is, some remarks on different kinds of locusts. The second part (pp. 8–16) deals with the present locust plague: the route taken by the insects from the east through Hungary and Austria to Bohemia and Silesia is traced (pp. 8–11); five peculiarities of the plague – number, size, and colour of the locusts, the coincidence of their appearance with some thunderstorms, and their orderly formation in flight – are enumerated (pp. 11–13); it is asked whether the the locusts constitute a bad omen in addition to the actual damage they do (pp. 13–15); finally, various ways of repelling the disaster are discussed (pp. 15–16).The author's overall approach is not that of a naturalist. Zoological aspects are discussed summarily, and Kirchmaier does not even dare to decide whether locusts have four or six legs (p. 4). The work's two most conspicuous aspects are the great number of authorities cited and the theological interpretation of the events. Kirchmair's citations range from classical authors and the Bible to contemporary pamphlets, which are quoted at length in the original German (pp. 8–11). Over long stretches, the text primarily consists of quotations and paraphrases, while the author's contribution is more or less restricted to transitions from one string of citations to the next.

Ermolao Barbaro tried to mend the situation, but his new translation was left in manuscript at his death in 1493. It was printed only 23 years later on the initiative of his nephews Luigi and Francesco Barbaro by Giovanni Battista Cipelli alias Egnatius, possibly as a reaction to news about another forthcoming translation by Jean Ruel, which in the end appeared some months after Ermolao's (Touwaide 2012, 374–375).After the title page, the book first displays a rich array of paratexts: a table of contents, a letter of dedication by Egnatius to doge Leonardo Loredan and the senate of Venice, a medical glossary of a dozen pages, a privilege by Pope Leo X and a laudatory epigram in Greek by a certain Petros Alkyonios. The followingIndex copiosissimusis true to its title, as it comprises no less than 58 pages.After the five books of theMateria medica, as we understand this work today, there follow another two – or, if one believes the table of contents and the erratic page lemmata, three – books on venoms whose authorship is unclear but which are often found appended to theMateria medicain the tradition (fol. CXXr to CXXXIIIr). On fol. CXXXIIIIr–v, one finds a few more recipes under the title ""Also the following is found in the manuscripts, but I do not believe it to be by Dioscurides"", and the colophon.Finally, there is Barbaro's Corollarium in five books, separately foliated and introduced by an address to the reader by Egnatius and Barbaro's (but Egnatius' according to the title) preface. As suggested by the title, this is less a commentary in the modern sense of the word than an extensive collection of botanical, medical and literary addenda.In terms of style, the translator strives for terminological precision, but also for brevity, compressing Dioscurides' already terse and pregnant Greek even further. For example the seven lines in which Dioscurides describes the medical herb βρεταννική (4.2) become just four in the translation (fol. LXXIIIIr, ch. DCIX):Britanica sive Betonica folio cernitur rumicis sylvestris, sed nigriore pilosioreque, gustus astringentis. Caule haud magno, radice brevi et tenui. Succus exprimitur foliis et in sole aut igne versatur. Natura spissandi privatim ad nomas oris tonsillarumque utilis, demum ad omnia quae densari opus sit.If one thinks of the plant descriptions in laterHistoriae plantarumand similar writings, it becomes apparent how these were influenced by Dioscurides via early translations such as this one.The book's layout is neat, as each drug is given its own title in capitals and a numerus currens. Together with the aforementioned index, this greatly facilitates consultation.Despite the book's merits, it proved the least successful of the three Latin translations of Dioscorides that appeared in the early 16th century. While Ermolao's version was never reprinted, some thirty editions appeared of Ruel's aforementioned translation, and the Latin Dioscorides of Marcello Virgilio Adriani (1518) went through  five editions – not to speak of the tremendous success of Pietro Andrea Mattioli's translation and commentary (Commentarii in sex libros Dioscoridis; cf.

"Alessandrini, Giulio","Iulii Alexandrini serenissimi Romanorum regis physici, De medicina et medico dialogus libris quinque distinctus",,1557,Zurich,"Geßner, Andreas",16th century,"Dialogue, Bibliography",Medicine,De medicina et medico dialogus(e-rara.ch),599722,"Comprising five books and over 350 pages, thisDialogue on Medicine and on the Physiciancomposed by the personal doctor to emperor Ferdinand I, Giulio Alessandrini, counts among the most ambitious experiments made with the genre in early modern scientific literature. The work's macrostructure draws on the traditional dichotomy betweenarsandartifex: the first three books discuss the medical art, the last two sketch the perfect physician. As to the single books, book 1 contains a defence of medicine against its detractors, book 2 discusses its character as anars(not ascientia), and book 3 is devoted, alongside various other topics, to its scope. Book 4 describes the training of the future physician, while book 5, which stands out as the longest book by far, starts from abibliographie raisonnéeof works to be studied by the medical apprentice and concludes with remarks how the physician should exercise his craft.In terms of setting, chronology, and personnel, the five books correspond to as many days. Of the five participants in the conversation, two, Hieronymus Aleander and Matthaeus Curtius, can be identified with historical personalities, namely the humanist and cardinal Girolamo Aleandro (1480–1542) and the physician Matteo Corti (1475–1542). Chances are that the other three, Varinus, Ioannes Petrus Turranus and Marcus, are historical as well, but as no identification imposes itself in their case, one cannot be certain. The conversation takes place in Rome in the houses of Aleandro (book 1), Turranus (books 2–3), and Curtius (books 4–5). In each case, the host is at the same time the main speaker. Since the historical Girolamo Aleandro moved to Rome only one year before his death, the dialogue must be set in 1541 or 1542.In situating the conversation just before the demise of two of the main speakers, Alessandrini is inspired by Cicero'sDe oratore, where the dramatic date is 91 BC, shortly before the death of Marcus Licinius Crassus.De oratorealso serves as a model in other ways: As Cicero's work is devoted to the description of the perfect speaker, the second part of Alessandrini's work describes the perfect physician. In both cases, the dialogue is not (as the Platonic dialogues are) dramatic, but is narrated by one of the participants, namely Cicero and Varinus respectively. In both works, dialogue proper soon gives way to continuous expositions delivered by the most authoritative interlocutors. In the same way as Cicero, Alessandrini carefully describes the behaviour of his characters as well as the settings and circumstances of the conversation. At the very beginning of book 1, for instance, the conversation about medical topics is triggered by the fact that Aleandro suffers from malaria (quartana). As inDe oratore, some curious listeners are present in addition to the interlocutors in Alessandrini's dialogue, too, at least on the last four days. BesidesDe oratore, the work also is reminiscent ofDe finibus bonorum et malorumandTusculanae disputationes, both of which comprise five books. Generally speaking, the long, complex periods in which Alessandrini's characters express themselves sound distinctly Ciceronian as well.The dialogue is introduced by laudatory epigram in six Greek iambic trimeters byConrad Gessneron the title page, a letter of dedication to Ferdinand I, a note of the printer to the reader (typographus ad lectorem) and a table of contents. In the dedication, Alessandrini somewhat disingenuously asserts that he has composed the work without a clear plan, piecemeal and in a careless style. In his address to the reader, the printer explains that he has divided books 2–5 into chapters by marginalia with the help ofalterius medici(""another doctor"", presumably Conrad Gessner). The work is followed by an extensive index and a list of errata.",,"Alessandrini, Giulio‎(← links)","Alessandrini, Giulio:De medicina et medico dialogus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_medicina_et_medico_dialogus(last revision: 01.03.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In the introduction to the first volume, Lorry calls melancholy anobscurum mali genus, ""an intricate kind of evil"" (p. 1), referring to the difficulties of defining and treating the affliction. The first volume is devoted to melancholy itself, the second volume to its treatment. According to the dedication letter, Lorry had the second volume published with a delay of one year, in order to allow other medical professionals to contact him and weigh in after reading the first volume (pp. xi–xii). If this was indeed the case, then it is not visible on the title pages of the two volumes, both of which display 1765 as the year of publication.In his treatise, Lorry identifies two types of melancholy, humoral melancholy (caused by black bile) and nervous melancholy (caused by nerves), combining ancient humoral pathology and newer medical ideas. Interestingly, the preface of the German translation lauds Lorry's conservative defense of humoral pathology (Vorbericht, p. 3), whereas Lorry's dedication letter in the Latin publication highlights the familiarity with both ancient medical texts and modern discoveries as an important trait in his readers and, by implication, in his own work (p. xii).As is clear from this dedication letter, the intended audience was the Latinate medical community. This is also suggested by the fact that the two volumes are dedicated to physician-friends, Louis Guillaume Le Monnier and Stéphane-Louis Geoffroy. While the declared aim of the treatise is to stimulate professional discourse on melancholy, it is itself the product of this discourse. In the dedication letter, Lorry reminds Le Monnier about their conversations about melancholy, which pushed him to think further about the condition, to scour the pertinent books, to discuss it with other Parisian physicians and, finally, to publish fruits of his intense research (pp. x–xi).Indeed,On Melancholy and Melancholic Diseasesbrings together theoretical reflections and case studies from ancient and recent literature, oral reports from colleagues and personal experience (for the latter two, cf. e.g. pp. 281–82). The style of the treatise is simple and succinct. Lorry reflects on this matter, stating that it is better to contribute to the scientific discussion than to delay publication and perfect the work in style (p. xi). The paratext is stripped-back too, and approaches what we associate with a scientific monograph today, although the footnotes are quite sparse. The only ornamental element of the paratext are the mottos on the title pages, both taken from Vergil'sAeneid.A German translation of Lorry's treatise was published in 1770. The preface defends the translation and the shift of audience that goes along with it. Even if the work seems to be written for a learned audience, a non-Latinate potential, or early-stage, sufferer of melancholy can also profit from it, if he reads it in time (pp. 3–4).","Schings  1977, 59–72","De effectibus musices in corpus animatum‎(← links)Lorry, Anne-Charles‎(← links)","Lorry, Anne-Charles:De melancholia et morbis melancholicis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_melancholia_et_morbis_melancholicis(last revision: 21.02.2022).",Dedication letter: two things matter in life - veritas and amiticitia,,Yes,IT,

Situated at the borders of mathematics, economics, and psychology, this article is a groundbreaking first attempt to give a realistic account of the way people make risky choices in the real world.The text is divided into 19 paragraphs. Of these, §§1–12 make up the article itself, while §§13–19 are examples for the application of Bernoulli's new theory. The article starts from the standard definition of the notion of ""expected value"" (valor expectationis, §1). The common assumption that it is the expected value that guides people's choices is shown to be contrary to experience in many cases (for example, a beggar who is offered either 9000.- for sure or a 50% chance at 20.000.- will usually choose the former option, although the expected value of the latter one is higher, namely 10.000.-). Therefore, Bernoulli replaces the expected value by the expected utility (emolumentum medium, also translated by ""moral expectation""), which also depends on the wealth of the person who makes the choice. The main assumption is that utility increases less than nominal value. For a beggar, an increase of 100.- is a larger increase of utility than the same amount for a rich man. In §5 he proposes the utility of gaining a certain value to be in inverse proportion to the value of the respective person's possessions at the moment of the choice. This assumption yields a logarithmic dependence of utility on the nominal value (which is derived in §10), i.e., a logarithmic ""utility function""uin modern terms. Leaving aside this assumption, Bernoulli deals with the practical calculation of expected utility in §6 by means of a diagram showing the graph ofu. In modern terminology this amounts to calculating the expectation ofu(X)instead of the expectation of the random variableXas in the classical approach.This is followed by two corollaries that embed Bernoulli's theory into the classical one. Corollary I explains that if the utility increases proportionally to the gain, one obtains the conventional theory; Corollary II reproduces the classical theory by assuming infinite wealth of the gambler thus being able to ""neutrally"" conceive gains and losses.The rather technical §§10-12 are dedicated to the mentioned logarithmic utility function which is mathematically derived by integration. In §11, Bernoulli shows that the value at risk is the difference of the geometric mean of expected wealths and the initial possessions.§§13-19 finally discuss in some detail a number of case studies in order to demonstrate the usefulness of Bernoulli's new theory. First, the way to calculate the maximum wager for a numerically characterized situation as it may arise in gambling is explained  (§13). One result of this discussion is the fact that the sum of the utilities of all gambling parties is always smaller than zero, because losses count more than wins – a decisive argument, Bernoulli remarks, against gambling in general. No expected gain, no matter how big, can ever compensate for the danger of loosing one's entire fortune (§ 14). Next, it is shown on the basis of the same premisses that it is reasonable to accept or refuse, to offer or not to offer a certain insurance for a cargo vessel dependent on the parties' actual asset situation. Contrary to gambling, insurances can result in win-win-situations (§15). Moreover, it is often useful to spread one's risks, for example by dividing one's cargo between a number of vessels (§16). In the last part (§§17–19), the so-called Saint Petersburg paradox – although the expected value of one's win in a certain game is infinite, people are willing to pay only very modest sums for the right to play it – is for the first time elaborately described in print and a solution with the help of Bernoulli's new theory is proposed.Bernoulli is able to explain complex issues with great clarity. The article itself hardly contains any mathematical formulae and can be understood by any interested layman. Also the diagram poses no great difficulties, as it is diligently explained in the text. Only the case examples presuppose some mathematical knowledge. The terminology, by contrast, can sometimes be challenging for the modern reader, and especially his description and manipulations of the utility function lacks the clear modern functional account and is reminiscent of outdated Greek style mathematics. Again, the mathematicalterminologystrictly speaking presents less of a problem, since many of Bernoulli's terms are still used in the same meaning today and the respective phrases are moreover mostly elucidated by the context. It is not hard to guess, for instance, thataggregatum productorum(§1) means ""the total of the products"". On the other hand, it is not clear from the outset, for instance, in which exact technical sense the very general wordsors(""chance"", ""fate"" and many other meanings in classical Latin) is used in the article. When Bernoulli introduces new terminological distinctions, however, he carefully explains these to the reader. In §3, for example, he accurately distinguishes two possible meanings ofvalor(""worth""), namelypretium(""price"") andemolumentum(""benefit"").Bernoulli's article proves influential until the present day. The expected utility hypothesis, to which it gave rise, is still considered a useful tool in psychology and economics. The Saint Petersburg paradox still awaits a universally accepted solution.","Bernoulli 1954(English translation)Ciecka 2010Kahneman 2011, ch. 25","Bernoulli, Daniel‎(← links)","Bernoulli, Daniel:De mensura sortis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_mensura_sortis(last revision: 15.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Hortensius' treatise is dedicated to the French atomist and the dedication letter speaks of the author's admiration of the dedicatee and his writings, even if they do not know each other in person. Hortensius was assistant toPhilips van Lansbergenand would proceed to lecture at the Amsterdam Athenaeum in the year following the work's print.The dedication letter explains that, while Hortensius himself was unable to observe the solar transit of Mercury and Venus due to bad weather, he was beside himself with joy and exitement when he read Gassendi's report and his deliberations on the (surprisingly small) apparent size of Mercury. He proceeds to address Gassendi's report as well as his interpretations based on the observations with his own, citing from Gassendi's letter as well as pointing out passages from it in marginal notes. Hortensius agrees that Mercury's parallax should be very small. He then offers his own calculations for the diameter of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Juppiter, Saturn and the fixed stars, with the help of Lansbergen's data, who had been trying to rival Tycho's and Kepler'sTabulae Rudolphinae. He then proceeds with his considerations on the lunar eclipse of the same year, which Gassendi had treated in a postscriptum. In his reaction to Gassendi's second letter, his failed observation of the transit of Venus, Hortensius collects Lansbergen's thoughts on the position of Venus and goes on to discuss multiple questions, i.a. concerning an observation of Mars and a solar eclipse in 1630. All in all, on about one hundred pages, he offers a comprehensive answer to Gassendi's observations, full of his own data and hypotheses, as well as promoting Lansbergen's tables.

The latter had also, as he reports in the preface of his response, tried to observe the transit with the help of a type ofcamera obscura, a darkened room with only a small opening to allow the image of the Sun on a sheet of paper. This procedure had been suggested by Johannes Kepler and tried by many other astronomers all over the continent, without much luck. Schickard was hindered also by cloudy weather on the day of the transit. Gassendi, who had used a darkened room in combination with a simple Galileian telescope, had been more successful and managed to determine that Mercury had to be considerably smaller than extant tables had suggested. While Schickard congratulates Gassendi on this important observation, he very much doubts some of his conclusions. Dividing his comments on Mercury into three subchapters, according to observations and interpretations Gassendi had made in his letter – concerning Mercury's size, the time of the transit as well as its position – Schickard makes it abundantly clear that he doubts Mercury's apparent size as Gassendi reports it. Using several optical arguments, he tries to argue that the planet had to at least have a diameter of one minute of arc, not only twenty seconds, as Gassendi had observed. Other astronomers, e.g.Martinus Hortensius, would support Gassendi's measurements with their owncalculations.Schickard's attemps to argue for a greater size of Mercury are accompanied by several images, the letter is written in a largely technical Latin and low style.",Van Helden 1976,"Mercurius in sole visus‎(← links)Schickard, Wilhelm‎(← links)","Schickard, Wilhelm:De Mercurio sub sole viso, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_Mercurio_sub_sole_viso(last revision: 16.09.2021).",,"WB, JL",Yes,JL,

Its author, the later secretary of the Parisian Académie des Sciences, brings together ancient Aristotelian, medieval as well as contemporary ideas, frequently confuting ancient opinions and following especially the theories of Cartesianism. Because of this thorough collection of numerous hypotheses and the intricate blend of Aristotelian, Cartesian and other recent ideas, the dialogue was highly successful and used as a handbook especially on meteorological problems in France for about a century (Meinel 1987, p. 65).While the first book presents celestial phenomena and their causes, the second discusses stones, minerals and metals. Book One includes discussions of the role of subterranean fires as well as the causes of the tides (Cartesian vortices) and optical phenomena such as the rainbow and haloes, showing the legacy of Descartes' optics. Book Two includes lengthy discussions of chemical characteristics of thefossilia.
The text is presented as a dialogue between a Theophilus, proponent of the ""old"" philosophy, especially Aristotelian ideas; Menander, advocate of Cartesianism; and Simplicius, the seemingly neutral third philosopher who wishes to present the truth without adhering to one philosophical school (the voice of the author). Citing a myriad of ancient, medieval and early modern sources, most of all Pierre Gassendi and René Descartes, Du Hamel lets all interlocutors give long didactic speeches, interrupted only rarely by their colleagues. Questions and comments are usually limited to the beginnings and the end of chapters. The dialogue seems to be modelled on Cicero's works of this genre, both in composition and style.

This upland area in the English Midlands had been known for its miraculous phenomena, already called ""seven wonders"" in Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion, a poetic description of Britain, in 1622. But it was Hobbes' poem, which should make the wonders of the Peak District a famous attraction for travellers, as the Peak District developed into one of the most important destinations for English domestic tourism. The wonders were natural phenomena in the then remote and rather mountainous High Peak, a limestone plateau, where the travellers were able to admire not only the awe-inspiring estate Chatsworth, one of the homes of William Cavendish, but also natural phenomena such as dangerous caves, a deep abyss, springs and wells and a curious mountain. The poet recounts the traveller's interest in natural philosophy, as they set out to investigate the secrets of nature (l. 83), and discusses the causes of every wonder. At several points in the poem, empirical investigation, thorough scrutiny of the natural features of the Peak, scientific dispute etc. play a crucial role, e.g. when the author reports experimental attempts to determine the dephth of the abyss Eldon Hole, when, inside the cave Peak Cavern, he outlines the water cycle, or when, explaining why the ebbing and flowing well imitates the tide, he does not only reproduce a discussion over the causes by the travellers, but describes air pressure with the help of epic similes. The idea to praise seven natural wonders in analogy to the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, connects this poem to Denis de Salvaing de Boissieu'sSeptem miracula Delphinatus.The poem was written in 1627, but only printed in 1636. Several reprints followed, in 1666 and 1675, before bilingual editions with an anonymous translation on facing pages were issued in 1678 und 1683.

As the index that precedes the writings indicates, the text is divided into eleven chapters/books. While the opening part deals with general topics, mainly concerned with the notion and image of mathematical figures and their magical and mystical essence, the rest of the book is structured according to the mathematical scale from 1 to 10; each of the chapters thus touches upon, first, a number and, secondly, respective mathematical figures (for instance, five and the pentagon). Therefore, the main text is supplemented with images, graphs and descriptive explanations of Bruno's main points.As it is in the case of theDe immensoand Bruno's appropriation ofCopernicus, who, according to Bruno, did not understand philosophical implications of his own heliocentric system, Bruno expresses interest in mathematics until it is of use to, and complements his natural philosophical system.

The verse parts are sometimes very difficult to catch. Unlike theDe immenso, the prose sections, together with graphs and other supporting elements, are mostly intended to explain and reflect on the same problems present in verse.Overall, the writing provides a deeply metaphysical, magico-mathematical interpretation of the universe's structure and foundations and is centred on its ""easiest"" and ""basic"" element, that is, the monad.",Fiorentino et al. 1879–1891Monti 1980,"Bruno, Giordano‎(← links)De immenso‎(← links)Ad Iordanum Brunum‎(← links)","Bruno, Giordano:De monade, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_monade(last revision: 25.11.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

Having already been republished several times in its original language, the work was translated, a quarter of a century after its first publication, into Latin by the the Swabian physician Wolfgang Gabelkove, who also added two smaller texts by Bacci and several paratexts.The Latin edition, whose title features the Greek and Latin designations of the unicorn side by side, starts from a dedication by the translator to his territorial ruler Frederick I, Duke of Württemberg, which is followed by aprooemiumby Bacci and an address to the reader, which is again the work of Gabelkover. While Bacci speaks above all about the epistemological problems surrounding the unicorn, Gabelkover is above all concerned with the character of his translation. As he explains, he has tried to mend some obscure passages in the original (ut obscuritatem illam perspicuitate, quantum fieri potuit, resarcirem, sig. A3r) but has otherwise remained as faithful as possible to Bacci's text. Sometimes, linguistic purity had to be set aside in order to convey the sense despite the difficulty of the original which is not even understood in all places by the Italians themselves (sig. [A7v–8r]). Appended to the main text, one finds another, shorter treatise about the unicorn, titledDe virtutibus unicornu et utendi modo(On the Medical Effects of the Unicorn and How to Use It, pp. 121–131) and addressed to a Camilla Perretta, presumably Camilla Peretti, the sister of Pope Sixtus V, which repeats several points made in the preceding longer work. (This piece is of unclear origin, as it is not included in the Italian editions that are available online.) Next comes Bacci's monograph on the moose and the medical properties of its claws that has already been mentioned in the main title, a text which features a title page of its own and is separately paginated (pp. 1–39). Finally, one finds a one-page list of the most important questions discussed in the main work and a ten-page index to it.De monocerote seu unicornuitself falls into three parts. The first of these (Utrum sit unicornu, pp. 1–40) discusses whether the unicorn exists at all, concluding that it does. The second (Quid sit unicornu, pp. 41–81) tries to provide a correct image of the animal, its shape and habits – not an easy task given the disagreement between the various sources in all these respects. At least, it becomes clear that the unicorn must not be confounded with the rhinoceros (pp. 43–50). The last part (De virtutibus unicornu, pp. 81–121) is dedicated to the medical powers of the horn and tries to distinguish between real and fabulous ones.Bacci's epistemology is based on the tenets of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galenic medicine. Because he has never seen the animal with his own eyes (although he has examined many horns and parts of such – most of them presumably narwhal tusks – in curiosity cabinets of the rich and powerful, pp. 72–81), his approach is mainly philological: he discusses the respective testimonies of numerous authorities and weighs them against each other. In doing so, he often follows broadly speaking scholastic protocols of reasoning, as in the first part, which starts with five arguments against the unicorn's real existence, whereupon counterarguments to each of these are provided which lead up to the conclusion that the unicorn does exist after all.Regarding his style, Gabelkover remains true to his initial promise: his Latin is simple and convenient to read. Disconcerting constructions found in the original are indeed easier to understand in the translation, as becomes clear from a comparison between the very beginnings of both versions (p. 5 and p. 1 respectively), which can be rendered into English as follows:The first point one tries to clarify in dubious matters is to decide whether the respective thing exists or not, since once this first fundament is laid, one can subsequently go on to determine what the thing under discussion is, how it is, and why.Bacci writes:Il primo punto, che si ricerca dichiarare nelle cose dubbiose, è di risolvere se la cosa è, ò non è: perche presupposto questo primo fondamento, consequentemente si viene a determinare che, e come, e perche di quel, che si disputa.In doing so, the author awkwardly substantivizes the relative pronounche(""what"") and the conjunctionscome(""how"") andperche(""why""). Gabelkover, by contrast, spares his readers the resulting trouble, as he introduces a series of indirect questions, just as in the English version given before:In omnibus rebus dubiis declarandis et resolvendis ante omnia inquirendum est, utrum res aliqua sit vel non sit. Praesupposito enim primo hoc fundamento ordine quodam consequenter declaratur, quod sit, quomodo sit, et cur sit.On occasion, however, the reader is a bit confused whether Gabelkover'sunicornumeans the animal or the horn, since (as already in the original) both are invariably expressed with the same word. The use of the formunicornufor all singular cases, not only for the nominative, accusative, and ablative but for the dative and, quite unclassically, the genitive as well, is also somewhat baffling (see, for instance, sign. A3v, where Gabelkover writes ofipsius cornu viribus).In terms of layout, the translation by and large reproduces the original. Each of the work's parts is divided into several sections which are introduced by their own subtitles. Additional orientation is provided by marginalia.",,,"Bacci, Andrea; Gabelkover, Wolfgang:De monocerote seu unicornu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_monocerote_seu_unicornu(last revision: 08.05.2023).",Have seen the short treatise addressed to the pope's sister somewhere but can't find it anymore.,MK,Yes,MK,

It was first published in 1616 and enjoyed a successful reception, which resulted in several reprints, including the 1634 Paduan and the 1665 Amsterdam ones. Those were supplemented by rich illustrations.The subject matter of the book became popular in the early modern period. It combined two trends, widely debated at the time. The first concerned the limits of physiognomy and the idea that peculiarities of the human soul were reflected in one's physical appearance. Considering that since antiquity the main source for physiognomical speculations was pseudo-Aristotle'sPhysiognomonica, and Liceti was a devoted follower of the Stagirite, it comes as no surprise that (pseudo-)Aristotle's teaching were given prominence in theDe monstris. The second issue was a burgeoning Renaissance ethnography. Geographical explorations triggered a growing interest in inhabitants of regions other than Europe, and prejudice against the ""other"" often led to picturing them as monsters or people with physical or other defects. In this regard, Liceti's treatise responded to what could be of interest to the early modern reader. The fact that it was republished in Amsterdam, the capital of one of the most active maritime states, illustrates that the text ticked the boxes and attracted attention.
TheDe monstrisconsists of two books and, although it focuses primarily on human monsters, it also briefly outlines animal monsters and abnormalities among plants and the natural world. The core of Liceti's argument is firmly Aristotelian: he suggests that the reasons behind visible abnormalities in the physical world should be explained through the theory of four causes, and that any ""deviations"" from normality are due to the effects of the efficient (agent) cause. Why those effects occur is a two-fold problem. While in the natural world they demonstrate the diversity of species, some of which just happen to get created as ""corrupt"", in humans, physical ugliness can be a reflection of moral or other un-physical weaknesses. Along with a collection of primary evidence amassed from around the world and/or extracted from ancient, medieval and Renaissance sources, what serves to clarify that connection is a good deal of illustrations.
As regards the style and language, the book is a standard Neo-Latin work, clearly structured and with numerous references to ancient literature, including poetry (Ovid, Lucretius and others). At the same time, the division of chapters, usually by various manifestations of one or another cause, resembles the scholastic work on natural philosophy.",,,"Liceti, Fortunio:De monstris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_monstris(last revision: 17.11.2021).",,,Yes,OA,

In the wake of heated discussions concerning whether and, if so, how essentially the Flood changed the realm of the natural world (see Thomas Burnet'sTelluris theoria sacraabove all), Monti collects and describes the testimonies, which were believed to be the most reliable artifacts of the post-diluvian era: fossils. Monti explicitly states that his fascination with the subject owes a great deal to those who preceded him, mainly Nicolaus Steno (p. 3), who laid the groundwork for naturalistic investigation of fossils, John Woodward (pp. 5-6), who owned a large collection of fossils himself, and many others.The work is divided into two parts. In Part 1, Monti touches upon the contemporary debate about whether nature had been dramatically transformed as a result of the Flood. Against Burnet, for whom the Deluge marked a new ""aeon"" in the history of mankind, Monti stands alongside Woodward (whose work is being quoted extensively) in believing that nature contains numerous artifacts that attest to the continuity of humanity. To prove that, he intends to follow the example of his renowned forerunners, namely Johann Jacob Scheuchzer (for instance, p. 30), and to adhere to the research standards developed at his home institution, that is, the University of Bologna (p. 38). The result is Part 2, where he describes a variety of fossils he discovered in the Bologna region. The descriptions he provides are aimed at complementing the corpus of already existing fossil accounts (p. 44) for the benefit of both natural philosophy and theological confirmation of God's omnipotence (p. 47).
The work is preceded by a brief dedicatory inscription, which, addressed to Monti's university colleagues, resembles modern examples of this genre, as well as by an epigraph taken from the Psalms.","Barnett 2019, 135-36.","Monti, Giuseppe‎(← links)","Monti, Giuseppe:De monumento diluviano nuper in agro Bononiensi detecto, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_monumento_diluviano_nuper_in_agro_Bononiensi_detecto(last revision: 05.07.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

It deals with occupational medicine, that is, to how various diseases correlate with and originate from one's profession. It has been universally acknowledged as the first book of this type in the history of medicine. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Bernardino's work received acclaim on the part of social and economic theorists, including Adam Smith and Karl Marx. A significant number of essays that treat occupational medicine as an important phenomenon of modern society have mentioned Ramazzini's intervention. In the meantime, little attention has been paid to it by historians of early modern medicine and literary scholars alike.In the introduction to his treatise, Ramazzini recalls that ancient legal accounts among which he singles out ancient Roman laws and the Code of Justinian distinguished a variety of professions and protected their status. It implies that what Ramazzini aims to do is to extend this feature to the field of medicine. He consequently provides the reader with an extensive index of professions, which ranges from painters and carpenters to miners and chemists. More ""exotic"" cases include warders or funeral workers. Ramazzini structures his treatise so that it combines two central elements: first, a great deal of classical references that concern each job, especially in what regards the physical struggles a worker could experience; second, and when possible, contemporary scholarly accounts on how performing job duties could endanger one's health. To give but one example, while focusing on miners, Ramazzini shuffled his sources in that it appears that the issue at hand had been a matter of great concern for generations and just activated in the wake of Agricola's, Kircher's and others' geological investigations. The work also contains the first-ever assessment of headache as of an occupational indisposition.
The work was successfully received across Europe. The first edition, of 1700 in Modena, was quickly sold out. In 1713, one year before he died, Ramazzoni prepared the second version of the treatise to which he added twelve extra chapters.

Falloppio discusses first the origin of the disease, its different names, the question whether the syphilis was already known in antiquity and if yes, what could be possible identifications. He then describes the different symptoms, the disease process and treatments. He even discusses the use of remedies from South America, e.g. the guaiacum, as well as from Asia. In chapter 89 (“De praeservatione a carie Gallica”), Falloppio describes a way to prevent the infection with syphilis. This could be done by a kind of condom, a piece of linen soaked in a medicament (“linteolum imbutum medicamento”) that could be put around the penis. He explicitly states that he has tested this “condom” with 1100 men and calls God as his witness that none of them was infected (“ego feci experimentum in centum et mille hominibus et deum testor immortalem nullum eorum infectum”).

It is transmitted in three versions. Versions 1 and 2 are in the form of treatises, version 3 is a dialogue. It thus constitutes an early experiment with a form which Galilei was going to use forty years later on a much greater scale in hisDialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo(translated into Latin asSystema cosmicum).In each version, it is shown by way of various examples (e.g. floating bodies, projectiles) that every object has its weight and there are no objects that would tend to move upwards by virtue of their innate nature. Thus, Galilei refutes a pivotal aspect of the Aristotelian worldview. In terms of style, he writes a largely classicizing idiom with a bare minimum of technical terminology. Although he is not afraid of complex syntax, his text is quite easy to follow. All three versions are accompanied by a number of simple diagrams.Of the two speakers in the dialogue, Dominicus and Alexander, the latter is Galilei's mouthpiece. He freely criticises Aristotle's kinematics and designs his own. Dominicus' role mainly consists in prompting Alexander's explanations by his questions and to hold him back if he proceeds too fast, thus compelling him to justify his opinions more systematically. The exchange between the two can become quite animated. Dominicus can even interrupt his friend's mental leaps in mid-sentence, if necessary (p. 369). Galilei's considerable skills as a writer are in evidence already in this early text.","Favaro 1890–1939, vol. 1, 250–340, 341–366, 367–408","Cogitata physico-mathematica‎(← links)Galilei, Galileo‎(← links)Resolutio omnium Euclidis problematum‎(← links)","Galilei, Galileo:De motu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_motu(last revision: 10.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The two volumes are among the earliest and most influential works on biomechanics of the 17th century. Probably inspired byGalileo'sDiscorsi e dimonstrazioni mathematichewhich contained a discussion on the resistance of bones, Borelli started to work on human and animal motion.In the first tome, after criticising earlier works of anatomers as well as philosophers (e.g. byRené Descartes), Borelli focuses on the motion of the muscles as well as the extremities and on the different types of motion of both humans and animals (walking, running, flying, swimming etc.). Contrary to ealier opinions, he maintained that contraction is the only possible muscle movement. The second volume explains the bodily preconditions of motion, the causes of muscle movement, the role of the nerves, of the intenstines as well as of bodily fluids for animal motion. Borelli treats, i.a., heartbeat, blood circulation and respiration.

The practical focus of the work is underlined by two additional elements: first, Vossius dedicated it to the Dutch Republic that controlled a significant share of maritime trade at that time; second, the text lacks any references to classical sources or contemporary accounts that treated the phenomenon of tides. The feature distinguishes theDe motufrom some other of Vossius' treatises (such as, for instance,De aetate mundi) written with a humanist pen. This indicates that as his main audience, Vossius had in mind not his peers from theres publica literariabut rather wealthy shipowners and government officials. Thus, theDe motuwas predestined to success in the book market. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1664, Vossius later moved to England and had theDe motutranslated into English. The title and the opening section of the English version reiterated that its author was driven particularly by practice and the desire to help ""those who go to sea"".Despite a popular assumption that Vossius' idea that the winds cause the flow and ebb was radical and unconventional, this view dates back well into the Middle Ages; nor does it clearly indicate Vossius' opposition to Descartes. Be that as it may, the Dutch scholar's tract was supplemented with numerous graphs andhistoriaecollected from all over the world as to make a reliable map of dangerous currents.","Isaac Vossius 2012, 189-206","Vossius, Isaac‎(← links)De Nili et aliorum fluminum origine‎(← links)","Vossius, Isaac:De motu marium et ventorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_motu_marium_et_ventorum(last revision: 18.06.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

This procedure became the rule from c. 1800 but still was quite rare at the end of the 17th century. The dissertation also was exceptional in its presentation of original, innovative research.After the title page, six diagrams (to which reference is made in the text), and apraeloquium(""foreword""), the body of the text comprises 16 1/2 pages and is divided into 20 paragraphs. In terms of content, Bernoulli takes an iatromechanical stance, that is, he takes up the Cartesian notion of the human body as a machine and explains its working in mathematical and mechanical terms. (This is well summarized in the final sentence, where he writes that ""none [of the muscles] does not always follow precisely the mechanical laws exposed here by us"".) In doing so, Bernoulli builds onGiovanni Alfonso Borelli'sDe motu animalium(1680–81), a foundational work of iatromechanics. Borelli is duly acknowledged as the father of this approach in thepraeloquium, but Bernoulli also highlights that he goes far beyond his predecessor, especially in applying the newly invented calculus to muscular force and motion. His main results are the following: 1) A contracted muscle fibre always tries to assume a spherical shape, even if it can never perfectly achieve this goal. 2) The forces at work within the muscle itself are much bigger than those which the muscle exercises in the surrounding world.Bernoulli writes a masterly Latin which shows all the polish required in such a prestigious publication as an inaugural dissertation is supposed to be. He also excels at the brief and precise description of complex facts, circumstances, and relations (see, for example, the introductory description of the muscle, §§ I–II). If necessary, however, the Latin becomes rather technical on the lexical level, featuring expressions such aselasticitas,sphaeroidalis,machinula vel vesicula muscularis(§§ XIV–XV), and the text is interspersed with mathematical formulas. At § XIV, a spreadsheet is used to show the correlation between the degree of inflexion of the muscle and the resulting force.

The first volume was entitledAstronomiae instauratae progymnasmataand focused mostly on the ""new star"" of 1572 (cf. alsoDe nova stella), while a third one never appeared. This second tome deals with the comet of 1577. It was first printed on the island of Ven in 1588 and reprinted in Prague in 1603 with additional paratexts.The book covers c. 460 pages and, as Brahe states in his preface, is divided into two parts, the first one presenting all the observations and calculations Brahe made concerning the comet which first appeared in November 1577. The nine chapters of this first part comprise his detailed observations, the location of the fixed stars, the positions of the comet throughout the months of November and December, the angle of its motion, its parallax and position in the aether and not the sublunar sphere, and its tail and head.In the first chapters, Brahe's measurements on the position and the angular speed of the comet are not only presented in the text alongside explanatory geometrical figures but they also appear in so-calledEphemeridestables. Whereas these first chapters on the comet's position are rather descriptive, the sixth chapter on the parallax of the comet comprises almost 70 pages and represents the core of the work for the distance considerations extensively laid out in the second part. 
In the seventh chapter Brahe discusses the direction of the tail. Whereas most scientists since antiquity had claimed that the tail points in the opposite direction of the sun, Brahe's observations of the tail opposing the planet Venus (which is only a coincidence for this comet and not a general rule) are laid out in this chapter. Also, he notably cites asectionof Lucretius'De rerum natura. In the eighth chapter theTychonic world systemis presented: Earth sits in the center, sun and moon revolve around it whereas the planets revolve around the sun. The first part is concluded by tables of distances and parallax angles.The second partof the monograph consists of one single very long chapter, the tenth.

Book 1 provides an overview of the earth and the sublunar, elementary world. Book 2 describes the celestial spheres and the celestial circles such as the zodiac or the equator. Further explanations about these circles are given in book three, before the account moves on to their terrestrial counterparts and concludes with a survey of measures of length. The text thus performs a kind of circular movement itself, as it ascends from the earth to the sky and returns to the earth again.The work provides a pleasant and efficient introduction to some basic aspects of cosmology. Its hexameters are elegant, fluent and in general easy to understand. Mizauld takes care not to clutter his account with too much detail. He limits himself to the essentials, repeatedly directing the reader to advanced literature (or to teachers) if he wants to learn more.

In comparison toDe magnete, this work hardly contains any experiment report, but relies on textual authorities as well as observations for demonstration and reasoning.

As one learns from the Privilège du Roy, the project was a joint venture of Rondelet and Boussuet (as well as, obviously, of Bonhomme, the printer). That the three partners took the trouble to procure such a privilege (for twelve years) in the first place, shows that they supposed the enterprise to be profitable. Apparently, there was an audience for an encyclopedic history of water animals in verse, just as there was a market for poetic versions of the HippocraticAphorismssuch as theAphorismi Hippocratis versibus redditior for long didactic epics on various scientific topics (see the Semantic drilldown under ""Didactic poem"";Korenjak 2019).The text, which fills over 400 quarto pages, is divided into two separately paginated parts with slightly different title pages, corresponding to the two volumes of Rondelet's work. However, since the title page of part one refers to the entire (universa)Aquatilium historia, the two parts are mostly bound together and their make is the same, it is clear that thePoem on the Nature of Water Animalsconstitutes one single work. Both parts feature a number of poems of praise at the beginning, part 2 has another two at the end. Before the first laudatory poem, Boussuet himself dedicates his work to Charles, Cardinale of Lorraine, in an epigram and introduces it to the reader in a quite extensive elegy.Despite its title, which leads one to expect one coherent poem, the work is devided into several hundred entries, each of which is devoted to one animal, in imitation of its prose model. Each entry comprises a title giving the name of the respective animal, a woodcut copied from theAquatilium historiaand one, two or several epigrams. This structure reminds one of a collection of emblems, an impression which is enhanced by the fact that most entries occupy exactly one page. Sometimes, one epigram must suffice for several titles and images. The great majority of all entries of theAquatilium historiais taken over into the poetic work, with the exception of those few which are not accompanied by an image in the original work. Regarding the epigrams themselves, elegiac couplets are the most common metre by far, but hexameters, hendecasyllables and Horatian metres are found as well. Sometimes, Boussuet simply appropriated some lines from other poets which he found quoted in Rondelet's text. A water serpent, for instance, is described in hexameters taken from Virgil,Georgics3.425–31 (part 2, p. 126).In terms of content, most poems focus on the way of life, the behaviour and the culinary and medical qualities of the respective animals. As a typical example, the treatment of the porgy (pagrus) may be adduced. From Rondelet's two and a half pages on this fish (vol. 1, pp. 142–44), in which he discusses its name, similar species, its appearance, anatomy, and way of life, descriptions in ancient authors (including translations of Greek passages and some textual criticism), its taste and medical properties as well as the differences between marine and fluviatile specimens, Boussuet distils the following three elegiac couplets (part 1, p. 16):Carne quidem vili caenoque et vescitur alga / pagrus sepiolis pisciculisque aliis. / Sat nutrit stomachoque satis gratusque palato est, / per ventrem vero segnius eicitur. Praecellit caput et febres, quae saepe recurrunt / emendat: Quae non pharmaca pontus habet?""On inferior meat, mud and algas / the porgy feeds, on little cuttlefish and other little fish. / It is quite nutritious, pleases stomach and palate, / but only slowly is it thrown out through the bowels. / Its head is excellent and heals oft-recurring / fevers.

Placotomus claims to be the first to treat this topic in thePraefatio ad lectorem. The work is divided into two parts, the first part dealing with beer, the second similarly, but shorter with mead.Placotomus lays out the structure of the first part at the beginning (fol. 82r in the edition used here): he will first give an overview of the nature and the virtues of beer in general, then illustrate these short explanations with examples. After this, he will deal with other products made from beer and finally explain the virtues of condiments used for certain sorts of beer. He treats,inter alia, the nature of the ingredients, water, barley or wheat, and hops (Placotomus is not aware that yeast also plays a vital role in the production of beer, but he mentions thefeces, that is, in this case, the yeast that sinks down in bottom-fermented beer). He categorizes the ingredients according to the late-antique and medieval system of qualities of (medical) substances (hot/cold, dry/humid) and argues in opposition to many others that beer has a “calidum(hot)temperamentum” although its main ingredient, water, is cold.
Moreover, he deals with the bad reputation of beer in ancient text and argues that the beverages described in these texts are not the same as beer in his lifetime because they were,inter alia, made without hops. Placotomus claims furthermore that beer has good nutritional value. He also describes the different colors, foam, tastes, etc. as well as different sorts of beer in various German regions. 
Placotomus summarizes his arguments in 24 “conclusiones”, which are shortly explained in a “explanatio brevis”.
The second part on mead is shorter than the first on beer as Placotomus explains in a “praefatiuncula” because there are not so many different sorts of mead. He distinguishes firstmulsafrommulsum: the former being a mixture of mostly honey and water, the Greek ὑδρόμελι, the latter a mixture of mostly honey and wine, the Greek οἰνόμελι (these words are printed in Greek letters in the text). Onlymulsais according to Placotomus a traditional German beverage and will thus be treated by him.
He also deals with the nature of honey that he regards as being produced in the air and then falling down to earth (this is the prototypical ancient theory of the nature of honey). Placotomus finishes this part with a short “disputatio de mulsa”, a list of 12 theses and a “disputatio de ebrietate” comprising 11 theses.
Placotomus frequently cites from ancient sources such as Horace, Ovid, Galen, Hippocrates, Pliny, Dioscorides, Columella, Varro, Aristotle, and Vergil, but also cites contemporary authors like Johannes Manardus and Eobanus Hessus.

While the first Greek publication of the Hippocratic corpus dated from 1526, two Latin translations of the corpus were made by Marco Fabio Calvo (in 1525) and later by Janus Cornarius (1546). That gave early modern physicians the possibility to consult a Hippocrates not interpreted through the lens of Galen or other subsequent commentators.

It stresses that, while the ancient authorities have found the main principles of medicine, there is still something to discover, especially in the field of anatomy. Among the many physicians and anatomists, Variolio deserves special praise for his discovery of the optical nerves. He has communicated this discovery toGirolamo Mercurialein the form of a letter. This letter has been answered by Mercuriale who raised some questions and doubts, that were in turn answered again by Varolio. Aicardo states that he has implored Mercuriale to allow him to publish this important exchange of letters, which he finally granted after being first reluctant.
In the first letter dated 1 April 1572 (fols. 1r–20r), Varolio describes how he has discovered the correct origin of the cranial nerves and some other structures in the brain by anatomical observations in Padua. In contrast to many others, he started dissecting the brain from the skull and then started his study and observation from the base, rather than the other way around. There are also some schematic figures in the margins (fol. 5v, fol. 13r) and more detailed engravings of the brain together with the respective keys attached at the end of the letter.

The published version includes a short oration addressed to both the guests from outside the university, such as political figures of the city of Leiden, as well as van der Eyk's university colleagues and, last not least, the students which were honoured with prices.Between the short address (pp. 5-10) and the act of the distribution of prices (pp. 27-28), the rector read his hexameter poem of 340 lines, which was subsequently published together with the oration and notes by the author (pp. 29-36). 
The poem deals with the impossibility to really know anything about the secrets of nature. Thus, as the opening of the poem explains, the farmer as well as scientists such as chemists, physicists, or everyday men, can know how to work the land, how to dissolve metals, to experiment with electricity or magnets, but they are not able to fully understand the principles behind all this, the origins of metals, electricity, or more general, of the earth, of life itself. And the professor of mathematics does not regret this fact, for ""men should not know the causes of things"" (l. 36). 
He provides several examples, stating that even though Newton found and explained gravitation, the laws of motion, and planetary motion, even though others augmented our knowledge of the stars and the milkyway, the causes of these phenomena are not known and will never be known to us. The same holds true for the secrets of life, as he explains further.The poem then goes on to tell the history of the scientific revolution in this light, starting from men as farmers, experimenting with grains and lifestock, with beekeeping and silkworms - an allusion to the tradition of didactic poems on these topics? -, before chemists and physicians took over the investigation of the secrets of nature, exploring chemistry, electricity, magnetism and more. But the author warns men again not to seek too much knowledge, for these secrets are meant to be known by God alone, who created the world in such a miraculous way for mankind.

It contains some additional writings, including, primarily, a longer workDe natura lucis(On the Nature of Light), and its overall length is in fact over 200 pages. And yet, none of the appended texts made it to the title. For instance, theDe natura lucisis simply mentioned as an ""appendix"", even though in terms of content it does not have much to do with theDe Nili et aliorum fluminum origine(On the Origin of the Nile and Other Rivers). The reasons behind Vossius' decisions in this respect remain unclear. Moreover, modern studies have also often overlooked this editorial peculiarity. Be that as it may, the only text within the volume that is related to theDe Nili origineis the preface addressed to King Louis XIV of France.With regard to its style, the tract could be paired with Vossius' other meteorological/geographical account, theDe motu marium et ventorum. Even though both treat the topics widely discussed since antiquity, they almost entirely lack any signs of humanist learning. With a few exceptions, Vossius avoids referencing ancient sources in theDe Nili origineregardless of the fact that the origin of the Nile had been a popular subject matter in both antiquity and among Renaissance humanists. The rare cases when Vossius, nonetheless, quotes from ancient authors illustrate that he did not intend to present his tract as a humanist work. First, all such quotations are placed at the end of the tract, not at the beginning, which was more typical among his fellow humanist scholars. It implies that unlike many of his contemporaries, Vossius did not structure his argument as a continuation of what had been suggested previously, but focused instead on the practical side of the issue at hand. Second, most of the references are precise and short, and aim to clarify particular ideas, rather than to demonstrate the author's proficiency in languages and familiarity with ancient accounts.
While theDe motu marium et ventorumwas dedicated to the Dutch Republic as a country that has to deal with the phenomenon of tides the most, theDe Nili originewas addressed to the French King as his sovereignty has more major rivers than other states. In this regard, Vossius' geographical/meteorological account, which mainly summarises the existing evidence on how the Nile and other rivers originate, targeted practice, not belles letters.

As he states in the preface to the dialogue addressed to Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga, with the use of various arguments taken from ancient philosophers, poets and historical writings, he aims to explore the origin of water motion in general. He adds that although the question of the Nile's inundation was subject of interest of the Philosopher (that is Aristotle), the orator (Cicero), the historian (Herodotus) and the poet (Virgil), he does not seem satisfied with the explanations the greatest minds had proposed. In order to solve the issue, he structures the dialogue as a conversation between four main interlocutors -Girolamo Fracastoroconsidered as the main authority in natural philosophical matters, Timotheus, Adamus and Nogarola himself. Never put forth explicitly, the practical reason for the dialogue is to understand and consequently prevent the flooding primarily in the Veneto region and in other parts of Europe. To make his idea clear, Nogarola repeatedly refers to his and Fracastoro's home region and the inundations that recently occurred in Veneto.Composed in refined Latin prose and abounding in numerous quotations from both Greek and Roman classical authors, the dialogue remains within the traditional Aristotelian framework from a natural philosophical point view. However, there are some additions of Platonic elements taken mostly from theTimaeusand some Neoplatonic authors such as Proclus and Psellus. While, on the one hand, adopting the theory of melting snow in the Ethiopian mountains and its dependence on the astrological position of the stars and planets as the main reason for the inundation of the Nile, on the other hand, Nogarola uses the Neoplatonic tradition as something that was most of all connected with the original, that is Egyptian knowledge about the phenomenon in question.",,"Nogarola, Lodovico‎(← links)","Nogarola, Lodovico:De Nilo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_Nilo(last revision: 21.02.2022).","The dedication explains that the dialogue was written to recommend two recently published books on the Nile by Ramusio and Fracostoro.

The text then continues with the specification of the important terms mentioned in the definition. This section closely correlates with common patterns of thought and argumentation.

In addition, no more dissertations on snow are recorded after 1696.TheFirst Dissertation on Snowis intended to map the general field; in doing so, the text recapitulates the Aristotelian standard of knowledge, but also reflects on more recent approaches.Table of contents:Having dealt with the author's motivation (§1), the text presents common deliberations about snow, i.e., etymology (§2), homonymy (§3), then several different definitions of snow, which mostly are bases upon Aristotelian paradigms and its commentaries and mostly quote classical authors (§§4-5).The text's first main part discusses the very nature of snow, thereby being in accordance with natural philosophy. Here, the author reflects about the very nature of snow and its physicalness (§6), then about its matter (i.e.: the elements which constitute snow respectively their different proportions: clouds, air, vapors, exhalations, or, in other words, watery, earthen and fiery particles) (§7) and about other (salty and sulphury) particles (§8); the author chooses not to answer the frequently about the very colour of snow, subject to discussion in other texts.The Aristotelian causes are dealt with in the second main part. §9 and §10 thoroughly explore the “efficient causes”, beginning with the superlunary, then turning to the sublunary causes. Among them are the winds, the cold and, noteworthy, saltpeter, sal ammoniac and natron; in this paragraph, the author alludes to a corresponding experiment on congelation conducted by Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel.In the third main part (§11) the author recapitulates, in his own words, the generation of snow.The text's fourth and concluding part contains more general observations of snow: places, where snow can be found (among them are, e.g., mountains, the polar region, and especially the three atmospheric layers) (§12); natural signs of imminent snowfall (§13); methods of differentiation between the different atmospheric phenomena involving water (i.e., atmospheric circumstances, times and seasons, composition, state of aggregation) (§14); different kinds of snow, especially fresh-fallen snow in contrast to spring snow (§15).In the last paragraph (§16), the author humbly apologizes for the disputation’s brevity and, in order to conclude the pending investigation, also looks forward to future deliberations about snow.",,"Planer, Johann Andreas‎(← links)Pelsöczi, Martinus‎(← links)De nive dissertatio secunda‎(← links)De nive dissertatio tertia‎(← links)De nive dissertatio quarta‎(← links)","Planer, Johann Andreas; Pelsöczi, Martinus:De nive dissertatio prima, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_nive_dissertatio_prima(last revision: 13.01.2022).",,"MK, UK",Yes,UK,"Erfurt, Universitätsbibliothek Erfurt / Forschungsbibliothek Gotha, Diss.phil 8° 00047 (33)"

In addition, no more dissertations on snow are recorded after 1696.TheSecond Dissertation on Snowcontains 15 paragraphs; both in length and structure, there are certain similarities between the first and second disputation on snow. However, the text’s main focus is a different one: The text's deliberations concentratea) on the various shapes of snow(flakes) andb) on the formation resp. transformation of their various shapes.In doing so, the text primarily quotes various scholars and their relevant opinions on these two questions, i.e., Olaus Magnus, Thomas Bartholin'sDe nivis usu medico observationes variae, Rasmus Bartholin'sDe figura nivis dissertatio, commentaries and textbooks by Johann Sperling, Libert Froidmont, Pierre Gassendi, Honoré Fabri, Girolamo Cardano, Jacques Gaffarel, Niccolò Cabeo, Jean Chrystostome Magnen, Jean-Baptiste Du Hamel, Johannes Kepler, Athanasius Kircher, Michael Walther (Junior), Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, Hendrik de Roy, René Descartes, Christian Vater. The disputation also mentions another dissertation on snow, theDisputatio publica de nive, which was printed in 1659 in Wittenberg.
The text condenses the multiplicity of the described viewpoints into sophisticated presumptions, which closely orbit Wittenberg and its early modern scholars and, at the same time, refutes other opinions quite harshly.Table of contents:The text begins with a very general observation about the wonders of nature, among them also the minuscule snow(flakes): Snow definitely commands both observation and admiration (§1).§§2-4 deal with the various shapes of snow(flakes) and the observations made by different scholars; the text then concludes that a vast variety of such shapes exists.§§5-9 are about the formation resp. transformation of the various shapes. As in the previous section, a variety of scholars and their different opinions are quoted and, in a gradual manner, different causes for the formation of snow(flakes) are educed, e.g., mere coincidence, a so calledvirtus formatrix, the wind(s), the cold, the spirits, the matter itself, salt etc.§§10-14 deepen, to a certain extent, the above-named question: §10 summarizes Descartes’ viewpoint on the various shapes (i.e.: round, hairy, flat, six-cornered) and theories on how they transmute; §11 continues this display by adding Bartholin’s viewpoints; the text then critically comments on both positions, before (in §12 and §13) adding at full length Christian Vater’s viewpoints (which are quoted from his manuscript). Based on these assumptions, the disputation ends with the presentation of the author’s own viewpoint (§14): A position intimately connected with four Wittenberg scholars – Michael Walther (Junior), Georg Kaspar Kirchmaier, Johann Sperling, Christian Vater –, but also relying on deliberations of, e.g., René Descartes, as mentioned in §10.In the last paragraph (§15), the author prompts others to further investigate on snow and its formation(s).",,"Planer, Johann Andreas‎(← links)De nive dissertatio prima‎(← links)Schmeltzer, Christian‎(← links)De nive dissertatio tertia‎(← links)De nive dissertatio quarta‎(← links)","Planer, Johann Andreas; Schmeltzer, Christian:De nive dissertatio secunda, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_nive_dissertatio_secunda(last revision: 07.03.2023).",,UK,Yes,UK,"Halle, Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek Sachsen-Anhalt: 99 A 6979 (47)"

In terms of its length and structure, the dissertation resembles rather a short monograph than a written pamphlet suited to support the disputation. However, apart from the principal topic, the text also contains three general corollaries (most likely intended to prompt the disputation) and four short poems, dedicated to therespondensby thepraesesand three fellow students.Unlike other contemporaneous dissertations on snow, the text does not examine the very nature of snow or its formation: As its title suggests, it aims to report about a curious incident said to have happened in nowadays Banská Bystrica in theHungaria Superiorregion: the simultaneous precipitation of snow and numerous vermicular beings. It is probable that the incident reports the unexpected appearance of theCantharis fusca, which is a cold-resistant beetle. This species is common in Central Europe and can be observed crawling on the snow in winter. The incident is exaggeratedly analyzed against the background of theological deliberations about prodigies, presages, and omina. 
Three conclusions are drawn by the author: Worms can exist and survive even if covered by snow; it is possible that worms fall from the skies; worms absorb toxic substances from the earth and can become poisonous especially if remaining under snow layers.

In the course of his argumentation, Kepler also provides the first formulation of the so-called “Kepler conjecture”. It states that the most space-saving way of piling equal spheres (optimal packing), for instance cannonballs, are canonical arrangements where in the first layer the spheres are placed according to a hexagonal or quadratic lattice and the second layer emerges from the first by putting spheres in the slots. This yields two geometrically different arrangements.This conjecture turned out to be an extremely hard problem, and generations of mathematicians could not solve it, among them the famous Gauss. Only in 1998 it was proved by T. C. Hales using extensive computer aid. As this prove were not completely accepted within the mathematical community, Hales founded a new field of mathematics of automated proof checking: He turned the proof in a machine-processable formal proof and let it be checked by the software. Hales and 21 co-authors published the result in 2015.Kepler was a gifted and inventive writer, which can already be seen in the works title, as it contains a pun which is explained in the letter of dedication to Kepler’s friend Matthias Wacker.

In the chapters 11-40, the author then turns to different (medical) aspects of snow and discusses the possible meanings of snow in dreams of healthy and sick people. The following chapters present differentususof snow, e.g., how supplies and medicine are stored and refrigerated in snow, how snow must be filtered before drinking, what happens if one washes his hands and/or feet, how snow can be a remedy in cases of fever, hearth conditions, headaches, toothaches, eyestrains, inflammatory diseases, aneurisms, pustules, frost boils. Bartholin also writes about the right conservation of snow and describes different dangers (e.g., frostbite, snow blindness, nausea), 
TheObservationsare followed by theDe figura nivis dissertatio, written by the author’s brother, Rasmus Bartholin.Thomas Bartholins (occasionally enumerative) treatise mirrors the state of knowledge on snow in the 17th century and highlights the way how contemporary scholars could inquire on a specific topic: Bartholin respects ancient authorities (e.g., Aristotle, Hippocrates), considers contemporary authors (like Cabeo, Descartes, Froidmont, Gassendi, Kircher), knows about geographical particularities (e.g., snow in the Alps and on Iceland) and mixes them with his own observations and deliberations.

The star remained there in the same place for about a year and then vanished. Today, we know that this was a supernova. In the 16th century, the main question was whether this phenomenon should be assigned to the sphere of the fixed stars, believed to be immutable since Aristotle, or to the lower regions.Six months after he had detected the new star (cf. fol.Cr,elapsis iam mensibus sex), Brahe answered this question in his booklet titled ""A New Star, Never Seen in Any Former Age"". The short monograph of 37 pages is presented as a first-person narrative, illustrated with four diagrams and articulated in five parts. Part 1 narrates the history of Brahe's discovery, discusses earlier cases from the tradition, of which only one star, discovered by Hipparchus, is deemed comparable, and ends with a profession of ignorance regarding the causes of the phenomenon. Part 2 details the new star's position in the sky and emphasizes that this position has remained the same since its appearance. Part 3 calculates the star's distance from the earth and assigns it to the sphere of the fixed stars. Part 4 describes its size, brightness, and colour. In the last part, the astrological implications of the appearance are discussed. Although Brahe's text becomes quite technical and mathematical in the same places, esp. in parts 2 and 3, the thrust of his exposition remains clear throughout. His Latin is precise and beautiful and the interplay between the text and the few, but clear and well-chosen diagrams exemplary.The treatise proper is preceded by an exchange of two letters between Brahe and his elder friend Johannes Pratensis and followed by an open letter to Brahe's colleagues on the right way to practice astronomy and astrology, a short treatise on a lunar eclipse in December 1572 and an elegy to Urania.De nova stellawas instrumental in establishing, at the early age of 26, Brahe's reputation as one of Europe's leading astronomers. Its impact, however, was modest compared to the the later observations and measurements of the comet of 1577. Both proved that the celestial spheres were not unchangeable and the latter that these spheres apparently did not even exist.

As indicated in Italian below the title, the present publication is based on the manuscript Ii 6.5 fol. 102r-109v in the library of the university of Cambridge.Dixit algoritmi- al-Khwarizmi said, this is theincipitof the work. After a praise of God the six figures of Indian numbers are presented - except that afterquarum figurae sunt hethere is an empty space in Boncompagni's edition as well as in his reference manuscript, as he points out in a footnote. This happens every time (!), when examples of Hindu-Arabic numerals are supposed to support the verbal description so that in the whole work there is not a single appearance of them (apart from references to footnotes and folio numbers in the margins added by the editor). Many times the text refers to such examples which do simply not appear in this version. There exist other manuscripts, however, which do contain the expected Hindu-Arabic numerals in the respective places, seeVogel 1963for the comparison of two such sources.The text which is organised in paragraphs without any headings comprise topics as writing numbers in the Indian place-value system, basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, doubling and halving) and calculating with fractions. The latter are understood as sexagesimal fractions (i.e. minutes, seconds, terces, quarts, ...) which allows to carry out all calculations with natural numbers and some simple additional rules.There are other manuscripts that contain a chapter on taking the square root of numbers and fractions, but the one used here stops at this point and so does Boncompagni's edition.It is notable that the Italian editor and historian of science chose to publish this work in the year 1857 rather in the Latin medieval translation than in Italian or alongside an Italian translation. Only the rare annotations are written in Italian. As later noted (Folkerts 1997, 24), the edition contains several mistakes. Also, Boncompagni's source manuscript is not complete.

In the eighteenth century, the Collegio Romano was a hotspot of Latin scientific poetry. Its Jesuits produced didactic poems e.g. on therainbow, on thenorthern lights, onsolar and lunar eclipsesandelectricity, often singing paeans to Newton and his discoveries.Niccolai taps into this poetic tradition, but uses the mould of the elegy to expound and praise science in verse. His poem comprises ca. 300 verses and consists of two parts. The first part portrays the problems of gaining reliable knowledge about the natural world. This bleak vision serves as a foil for Newton discovering the true nature of light and colour, which is celebrated in the second part. The elegy constitutes an interesting hybrid of panegyric and didactic verse. In addition, it paints a vivid picture of both scientific frustration and scientific success.The elegy starts with arecusatioof epic in favour of science, which is the art most revered in the present. However, the poet's love of science is contrasted by the difficulties it poses for those who are passionate about it. In fact, malicious Nature make humans eager to learn everything, even though their efforts are in vain and they cannot perceive anything in the great darkness. The frustration of scientists is illustrated by the simile of a greedy miner who is digging deeper and deeper for gold and gems, only for them to escape him in the end.However, it is not only the interior of the earth or the heavens that humans cannot truly understand, but also their everyday surroundings. The tormented scientists are only able to grasp the surface of things, that is, the form and colour, but not the things themselves. Both reason and the senses can lead them astray, and their results might not be different from mythical stories. But not even the surface of things is reliable, as the example of colours shows.At this point, the stage is set for Newton to enter the poem as a luminous figure. He is praised in Lucretian terms as the first to walk this path and to discover theprimordia rerum(cf. Lucr. 1.55). The poet then describes the refraction of light with a prism, enumerates the seven spectral colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, and explains how colours are perceived. The elegy closes with Newton's rainbow, which functions as a sort of emblem of science and a colourful opposite to the darkness of science. Here, Niccolai adapts and appropriates parts of theIrisby his fellow Jesuit and Arcadian Carlo Noceti. For example, both poems end with an account of the biblical flood and a prayer to Iris, the personified rainbow.Niccolai's elegy was first printed in an anthology of the Arcadia. In this literary circle, scientific poetry enjoyed considerable popularity, driven especially, but not exclusively, by its Jesuit members (cf. Orazio Borgondio's poem on thecirculation of blood, Ruđer Bošković'sepigrams on astronomyand Leone Strozzi's epigram series onscientific instruments). In 1760, Niccolai quoted select passages from his poem in the fourth tome of hisDissertazioni e lezioni di sacra scrittura. In thechapter on the rainbow(pp. 322–341), he describes his elegy as ""in the style of Catullus"" and provides a list of corrections to the text. In 1772, the entire elegy was reprinted in a collection of poems by seven Jesuits (Carmina recentiorum poetarum septem e societate Iesu, pp. 103–112). Only in this edition, it was given the title under which it is discussed here.",,"Niccolai, Alfonso‎(← links)","Niccolai, Alfonso:De obscuritate philosophiae ac de repertis Isaaci Newtoni, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_obscuritate_philosophiae_ac_de_repertis_Isaaci_Newtoni(last revision: 24.12.2021).","The crucial questions discussed in the first passage are atomism, helio-/geocentrism, water cycle.Niccolai does not shy away from open questions (why is it that the spectral colours are refrangible in different ways, with an account of Newton’s hypothesis).Concerning the rainbow, Niccolai selects and rearranges different elements and ideas of Noceti's Iris in a new order (old theories, examples from every day life, story of the deluge and prayer for peace). In general, he furnishes them with more detail. Maybe he also picks up Noceti's personifying streak in a playful way, since he considers Juno as the one responsible for the rainbow (which is, however, immediately rejected as mythical fiction). The water plays are no longer those of the Villa d’Este, but the example is spelled out more clearly and with more detail. Noceti's second example here appears as a boy who spits water into the air. Niccolai quotes the Iris in his Dissertazioni.Appearance of Newton:Cum nova praepandens obscuris lumina rebusignavam obtrivit stirpitus inluviem,et veterum ausa patrum depellere durumimperium, sanctae restituit Sophiaeereptum decus et senium procul ablegavitNewtonus [...]",IT,Yes,IT,

The author was a Danish student at Wittenberg at the time, studyingartes liberales, but also medicine until February 1556, before he continued his studies i.a. at Frankfurt (Oder) and Tübingen. The poem is dedicated to the chancellor of the Danish King, Johan Friis. It is one of the earliest Danish didactic poems, belongs to the tradition of medicinal poems in this genre and formally to the texts written in the Ovidian didactic metre of the elegiac couplet. After an introduction stating curiosity about the works of nature as an intrinsic human feeling as well as the character of didactic poetry, and invoking Christ instead of ancient mythological entities as guide, the eyes, which are personified, are introduced as the most wise and noble invention of nature, as well as the mirror to the soul and every human emotion. The text is then divided by subtitles, explaining the location, parts, form, and colours of the eyes. Their proximity and close connection to the brain are described, both lying safely within the human skull; the different parts of the eye – eyeballs, pupils, lenses, the three liquids and five membranes according to Galen – as well as its connection to the brain; its perfect circular form. The different eye colours of humans are treated in the last section of the poem.As his most important source, the student of medicine Frandsen probably usedPhilipp Melanchthon's medical textbook, which was used during the time at Wittenberg University. The sections on the anatomy of the eye testify to this close connection.

These statements are interesting not only for the claim to novelty implied but also as an announcement that the work is firmly anchored in the framework of Aristotelian philosophy. For example, the very notion ofcausais Aristotelian; elements can metamorphose into each other. Aristotle is also cited more often than any other. (Besides, Agricola cites and criticises also Albertus Magnus and representatives of medieval chemistry, for example.)Right at the beginning of book 1, things subterranean are divided into two classes, namely things coming forth of their own and things that have to be dug out. The former are treated in books 1 (water and other liquids) and 2 (air, vapour – with a long digression on earthquakes – and fire). Before proceeding to the second class of things, book 3 opens with an excursus on the origin of rock, mountains, hills, and subterranean veins, that is, of the matrix in which these objects are formed.

It was written by Ole Borch, ""the first Dane to lecture specifically on chemistry at the University of Copenhagen"" (Shackelford 2004, 344). For Borch, philology and experimental science both were instrumental in establishing the importance of chemical knowledge (Abbri 2000, 220). Indeed, his history of chemistry highlights the ancient, noble roots of the contested discipline through philological analysis of the sources.As Borch tells it, chemistry was invented by the biblical figure Tubalcain before the deluge and blossomed in ancient Egypt in the Hermetic tradition. Over the centuries, it migrated from Egypt to Greece, Rome, the Arabs, China and the European nations, including Denmark. In view of this millenia-long history, Borch concludes that experimental chemistry, validated by its ancient origins, should be fostered in the academic institutions of his own time.The title page describes the work as adissertatio, but it is styled as a published oration: the readers are repeatedly addressed asauditoresand the text ends with the characteristicdixi. Moreover, the text runs uninterrupted by the paragraph numbers and chapter headings that are typical for treatises and dissertations. Instead, the reader is guided through the history by headings in the margins. This suggests that the work started out as an inaugural oration, but was expanded to book-length for publication.The oration is also visible in the rhetorical structure of the text. For example, the first words are a programmatic statement designed to make an impact on the audience, as chemistry is proclaimed the ""queen of arts"" (reginam artium chemiam, p. 1). At the end, there is a passionateperoratioin which Borch advocates for a renaissance of the ""sacred art"" in the Danish institutions.In 1702, Borch's history of chemistry was included as the first text in theBibliotheca chemica curiosa(pp. 1–37), a collection of chemical literature compiled by the Genevan editor Jean-Jacques Manget.","Abbri 2000Shackelford 2004, 344–349","Borch, Ole‎(← links)","Borch, Ole:De ortu et progressu chemiae dissertatio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_ortu_et_progressu_chemiae_dissertatio(last revision: 18.02.2022).","There seems to be a kind of ""de ortu et progressu"" literature across the disciplines.

Sometimes, this choice of the national vernacular over Latin seems to be understood as a reflection of the journal's conceptual and thematical modernity. However, while most articles were in fact in English from the beginning, quite a few nonetheless appeared in the tongue of the Romans over the first decades of the journal's existence, and not only as a makeshift by foreigners. Among those English contributors who thought Latin a more suitable medium for scientific communication was an otherwise obscure doctor of medicine called Philip Lloyd.In his concise ethnomedical contribution titledOn Certain Diseases and Remedies from Northern Countries, Lloyd enumerates and discusses a multitude of illnesses that were widespread and cures that were popular among Lithuanians, Cossacks, Swedes, Russians, Tatars, Lithuanians (again), Tatars (again), Russians (again), Poles, and Hungarians, quite generously extending the notion of ""nordic"" to regions and people situated far south of England. His selection of medical conditions and treatments seems at least partly be dictated by a predilection for exoticism: Cossacks apply leeches to their palates and gums (p. 311), Tatars suck the blood of young rabbits (p. 311), Polish hair may bleed if cut (p. 312), and inhabitants of Košice suffer from theporcellus Cassoviensis, a piglet-like swelling in the region of the spleen (p. 313). For the information presented in the first half of the article, anamicus in castris(""friend from the army"") who had long lived in the respective regions is given as the source, but nothing is said about the rest in this respect. For the most part, the account is purely descriptive. The truthfulness or otherwise of the statements reported remains uncommented except for the alleged evil eye (uroki) of some Lithuanians, which provokes an incredulouscredat quis vult(""may it believe whoever wants to""). Causal explanations are likewise discussed once or twice only. Regarding a disease calledplica(p. 313), Lloyd shows himself dissatisfied with the common etiology which holds the water of the affected countries responsible. Moreover, he distinguishes acausa intrinseca, that is, the bodily condition of the sufferers, from environmental causes. On the occasion of the bleeding hair of the Poles, it transpires that he has conducted some real research himself: hair, he says, is an outgrowth of capillary blood vessels,ut patet autopsia ope microscopii in pilis barbae felis aliorumque animalium(pp. 312–313; ""as is evident from what one can see for oneself with the help of a microscope in the hairs of the beard of a cat or other animals"").In terms of structure, the article goesin medias reswithout a word of introduction except for the title, and Lloyd does not bother to append a conclusion either. Whether this is simply carelessness (as it probably is in the case of his frequent returns to people already discussed) or reflects a conscious focus on facts and abstention from hypothesizing is hard to tell. Lloyd's Latin is simple and usually clear to the modern reader in spite of some grammatical slips such as in the abovementionedcredat quis vult. Some of his technical terms are forgotten today but were common at the time. The abovementionedplica(literally ""fold"", pp. 312–313), a kind of fleshy, hairy outgrowth at the back of the head, cannot be found in this meaning in lexica of classical Latin but is recorded in early modern ones such asKirsch'sCornu Copiae.",,"Lloyd, Philip‎(← links)","Lloyd, Philip:De partium septentrionalium quibusdam affectibus et remediis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_partium_septentrionalium_quibusdam_affectibus_et_remediis(last revision: 15.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

However, the work focusses on just one question raised by the new phenomena brought to light: Does the surface of the moon really feature mountains and valleys? The text was originally presented, no doubt in a much shorter version, orally as an academicquaestio disputataat the Collegio Romano, where LaGalla was professor of philosophy (on the pertinent discussions at this institution in general, seeWohlwill 1909, 329–36).In its published form, the text covers no less than 57 quarto pages in dense and small print, but it retains the precise, methodical structure of the argumentation that is the hallmark of thequaestio disputata(on which seeLawn 1993). Each of its eleven chapters bears a title declaring its argumentative function. Chapter I explains the aim of the work and question under dispute, II, the method of inquiry (physical, not mathematical), III, the work's further structure. In chapter IV, Galilei's observations of the moon are reported, while chapter V asserts the truthfulness of the telescope. Chapter VI defends the Copernican model of the universe, which is subsequently refuted in chapter VII. In this way, the traditional cosmology is confirmed so that it can serve as the fundament of the further discussion. Democritus' view of a plurality of habitable worlds and celestial bodies (which implies that the moon could resemble the earth) is summarised and disproved in chapter VIII. The same procedure is applied in chapter IX to various ancient and modern views of the moon as a corruptible body, according to which erosion could have led to the existence of mountains and valleys there. In chapter X, the question whether an incorruptible celestial body could be mountainous, is raised and denied. The final chapter concludes that the apparent relief of the lunar surface must bespectra tantum(""only apparent"", p. 51) and proceeds to discuss two possible explanations for this phenomenon. The idea that the moon could mirror the earth's surface is rejected. Rather, the apparent mountains are an illusionistic effect produced by brighter and darker parts of the surface, just as a painting looks three-dimensional although is is really flat.Although LaGalla's conclusions are wrong, as we know today, his work exemplifies the advantages of thequaestio disputataformat in the discussion of controversial issues. The format encourages the author to find as many strong arguments as possible not only in favour of his position, but also against it (see, e.g., p. 13–14, where the Ptolemaic notion that a rotating earth would cause a perpetual strong east wind is countered by the correct hypothesis that the atmosphere rotates in conjunction with the earth). Moreover, the argumentationin utramque partemfavours detachment and moderation. Indeed, LaGalla's polemics is temperate. Nothing more aggressive than, say,quod argumentum satis puerile est(""this argument is quite childish"", p. 21) is to be found in his work. (Galilei himself is even highly praised; all blame lies with some unnamed people who make inconsiderate use of his observations.) Finally, the clear and explicit structure makes the account of a complex issue comparatively easy to follow.The language, by contrast, is of little help in this respect, since LaGalla writes a difficult, syntactically complex Latin. Sentences like the following from the beginning of chapter VIII (p. 21) are no rarity:Verum quia posset adhuc aliquis haec, quae in luna videntur, vera existimare, prout in terra sunt, statuens multos esse terrestres globos huic nostro adsimiles et multos mundos, ut Democrytus statuebat et ut Chalperus [Kepler] iocatur in sua dissertatione cum Sidereo nuntio recentem auctorem damnati nominis et eius insaniam ridens, non erit propterea absonum et hanc opinionem expendere, ut facta inductione per singulas opiniones, ad quas haec phaenomena referri possunt, quod ab initio polliciti sumus, quaesiti veritas facilius innotescat.At the same time, this example also shows that LaGalla's Latin is highly classicistic. He obviously had no problem with dressing the scholastic form of thequaestio disputataup in humanist garb.The work is preceded by a dedication to the young cardinal Aloysius Caponius, four epigrams in praise of the dedicatee and the author, an imprimatur by the ecclesiastical authorities and an excuse for the number of typographical errors (which is very high indeed). It is followed by another, shorter disputation about the nature of light (pp. 57–72).Galileo, who read the work, was not happy about it and even seems to have contemplated the possibility to write a response. Nonetheless, he and LaGalla remained on friendly terms.","Bucciantini 1995, 49–51","De phoenomenis in orbe lunae physica disputatio(redirect page) ‎(← links)LaGalla, Giulio Cesare‎(← links)","LaGalla, Giulio Cesare:De phaenomenis in orbe lunae physica disputatio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_phaenomenis_in_orbe_lunae_physica_disputatio(last revision: 19.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Both works were written at the instigation of some of Magini's students of mathematics at Bologna, who desired to have a thorough discussion of the practice of surveying (fol. 1r).The work's contents are briefly adumbrated in the preface (fol. 2v) and usefully detailed in a table of contents at the end. Magini starts from definitions of several key terms (fol. 3r–4v). Next comes some  guidance how to use the tables which take up the largest part of the work (fol. 5r–16v; see below), followed by a number of trigonometrical theorems (propositiones; fol. 17r–40r). The four aforementioned tables are dedicated to squares from 1 to 10000 (tabula tetragonica, fol. 40v–64v), sines (tabula sinuum, fol. 65r–80r), tangents (tabula linearum tangentium, fol. 81r–98v), and secants (tabula linearum secantium, fol. 99r–108r). The trigonometric functions are definied in a ""unit-circle"" of radius 100000, they are accurate to one arcminute, and use symmetries in the circle. In fact, the tables do not only present numerical values for the sine of an angle (calledsinus primus) but also for the cosine (which is calledsinus secundus). The same is true for the cotangent (tangens secundus) and the cosecants (secans secundus). 
There are two notable curiosities about these tables: Firstly, the mere appearance of the termstangensandsecans. They had been invented byThomas Finckonly some 10 years before and published in his workGeometria Rotundifrom 1583. Magini, who was in correspondance with Finck, adopted these terms quickly (as did, e.g.,C. Clavius, cf.Schönbeck 2004, 91).
Secondly, in his tables of the trigonometric functions, he appears to be the first mathematical author to consistently use the decimal comma (cf.Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 286). However, Magini does not seem to find it necessary to emphasize this important innovation.
All in all, the tables comprise some 15,000 numerical values and represent an immense calculatory effort.Magini takes pride in hisfacili ac disctincta methodo(""easy and clear method"", fol. 1v) of exposition. In fact, his writing is lucid, precise and illustrated by examples and diagrams wherever useful. In some cases, several solutions to a certain problem are given. Moreover, Magini is very conscious of terminological problems and does much to avoid confusion not only by his initial definitions, but also by comparing his own word usage to that of previous authorities (e.g. in the titles of his tables). With all of these facilitations, he tries to reach out to an audience that extends beyond the academia but nonetheless seems to have some Latin: as the book's title page announces, it is supposed to be ""very useful to astronomers, geographers, geodesists, engineers, architects, soldiers, surveyors and finally to all professors of mathematics"". The dichotomy of Latinate intellectuals and practitioners who had no Latin, which is usually taken for granted in the history of early modern science, does not seem to apply in this case.",Merzbach; Boyer 2011Schönbeck 2004,"Magini, Giovanni Antonio‎(← links)De dimetiendi ratione‎(← links)","Magini, Giovanni Antonio:De planis triangulis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_planis_triangulis(last revision: 27.01.2022).","This andDe dimetiendi rationeare textbooks in the wider sense only, the only link to institutionalised teaching being Magini's students at Bologna.","DB, MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

It discusses thefacultas plastica, the force within the seed which is responsible for forming an animal body from previously formless matter. This goes back to Galen's workOn the Formation of the Foetus, where he had discussed a formative power (dynamis diaplastike). After a preface introducing the previous thoughts (Aristotle,Galenus,Hippocrates) and contemporary controversies (Jean Fernel,Niccolò Leoniceno) on the matter, Schegk first distinguishes different causes, which are able to influence nature. His plastic faculty belongs to the type of causes which can generate living creatures. The power to do such a thing was given by God himself, so that the seed is able to produce a living being, even though it is not an animate matter itself, but has a status between inanimate and animate being. Thus, the plastic faculty is one of the most admirable natural forces, as it is able to construct a capable, aesthetic, functional body, which can then be inhabited by a soul.Schegk writes a classicizing, largely technical Latin, which is frequently interspersed with Greek quotations or termini. His work influenced later German protestant authors such as Johann Comenius and could have also leadWilliam Harveyto his theory of avis plastica(Hirai 2011, p. 81). As indicated on the title-page, the work is followed by two additional treatises, the first treating the Galenic notion of innate heat and cold within the body, the second explaining that the venous system, not the liver, is responsible for the creation of blood.","Hirai 2007Hirai 2011, pp. 80–103","Schegk, Jakob‎(← links)","Schegk, Jakob:De plastica seminis facultate, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_plastica_seminis_facultate(last revision: 25.11.2021).","NB: the headings of almost all the pages of theLiber de calidowrongly say ""liber tertius de plastica seminis facultate"".The two shorter treatises contained in the volume could be of interest as well.",JL,Yes,JL,

An ardent admirer of Greek medicine, in his work Leoniceno criticises the Latin/Islamic tradition personified, in his opinion, in the figure of Pliny the Elder. The treatise consists of four books written at different stages of Leoniceno's career, each with a different addressee. In the first book addressed to Angelo Poliziano, Leoniceno criticises Pliny for introducing numerous errors in medicine and natural history. After Poliziano did not support Leoniceno's attack on Pliny, Leoniceno decided to address the second book of his opus to Ermolao Barbaro, who in 1492 had published theCastigationes Plinianaein which he had also pointed to numerous inaccuracies in Pliny's description of natural history. However, for that, Barbaro blamed not Pliny himself but subsequent scribes, who misunderstood the essence of Pliny's theories. Leoniceno's position seems to be more radical: in the second book, he again accuses Pliny and his Latin and Islamic followers of the inconsistency in the fields of medicine and natural philosophy. Since Leoniceno's criticism was not supported by Ermolao either, the third book entitledErrores Hermolaisummarised his arguments, this time in form of a controversy with Barbaro. The final version of the treatise supplemented by Book IV was published in 1509.","Thorndike 1929–1958, vol. 4, 593–610Mugnai Carrara 1991Ogilvie 2006Hirai 2011","Leoniceno, Niccolò‎(← links)De rebus coelestibus‎(← links)","Leoniceno, Niccolò:De Plinii erroribus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_Plinii_erroribus(last revision: 13.12.2022).",,,Yes,OA,

The audience comprised not only medical, but also law and arts students as well as notables of the university. The following year, Carnarius included the oration, together with another speech and a couple of poems, in a volume dedicated to a Carinthian noble.The oration belongs to the genre of the paradoxical encomium, in which base subjects are praised to comic effect. This genre goes back to antiquity, but its most famous representative is Erasmus'Moriae encomium(Praise of Foolishness, 1511). The speaker explains his choice of subject and genre, which are quite unusual in an academic oration, in an introductory passage, which also contains interesting information about the circumstances of delivery and the possible reactions of the audience (fol. 5r–6r): An opening oration is de rigueur when a professor of medicine begins his lessons. Whoever starts straightaway with the explanation of the respective text is hissed, since the audience traditionally also comprises medical laymen. The most common alternative, a praise of medicine in general, threatens to be too boring, since the audience has already been exposed to many such speeches. Therefore, Carnarius has chosen to entertain his listeners with a paradoxical encomium, which moreover suits the theme of his course, diseases of the joints (cf.Siraisi 2004, 201).The oration comprises 21 octavo pages and loosely follows the traditional structure of the personal encomium, beginning from the genealogy of Gout, as programmatically explained on fol. 7r. The amusement value of the text mostly stems from the presentation of elementary medical knowledge in mythological disguise. For instance, Podagra is presented as the daughter of Bacchus and Venus, which alludes to the belief that the disease is caused by intemperance with regard to food, drink, and sex (fol. 7v). Some social criticism is implied by the repeated reference to the notion that Gout only dwells in the houses of the rich and powerful. The interests of the medical profession itself are also mildly satirised when Carnarius recommends Gout with the argument that it makes even rich misers generous vis-à-vis doctors (fol. 11r). The style is mock-grandiose. Ancient authorities are freely cited, and there is a sprinkling of Greek quotations, as on fol. 12r, were the orator speaks of the χεῖρας ἀάπτους, the ""untouchable hands"", of Gout, styling her as a terrible Iliadic warrior.",,"Carnarius, Johannes‎(← links)","Carnarius, Johannes:De podagrae laudibus oratio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_podagrae_laudibus_oratio(last revision: 17.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

However, it is a letter of a special kind, namely a short monograph in letter form, as indicated by the termdissertatio epistolarisin the full title. Such 'letter monographs' were a popular genre in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many of the respective works were titled exactlydissertatio epistolarisorepistolica(cf., for instance, theDissertatio epistolica de cancris et serpentibus petrefactis ‎). In the very last paragraph (p. 211), it transpires that the dedication to Friedrich Zwinger, professor of theoretical medicine at Basel, and perhaps the very composition of the work was occasioned by a gift of several specimens for the author's natural history collection and constitutes Hofer's return gift to Zwinger.Hofer has no doubts that the antediluvian patriarchs actually had a lifespan of many centuries, but takes the Bible's word for it. The question he tackles is how this longevity was possible on natural, broadly speaking medical grounds. His final answer is that it did not result from a fundamental difference in bodily constitution (pp. 199–200), but rather from the better environmental conditions before the Flood. The early patriarchs enjoyed better drink (especially water not spoiled by soluted limestone, p. 199) and healthier (vegetarian, p. 205) food in the first place, but also purer air and a more temperate climate, as there were no seasons due to the absence of the earth's axial tilt. For this reason, they were free of all or most diseases responsible for premature death today, as Hofer explains with recourse to his own experience as a practical physician (pp. 206–211).In terms of structure, Hofer's work makes a muddled impression. After the inital address to Zwinger (pp. 169–170), the text starts from a short overview of the biblical evidence for the length of human life before the Deluge and its gradual decrease thereafter (pp. 170–171). It ends with the aforementioned conclusions. Most of the pages in between, theoretically dedicated to an analysis of the conditions prevailing before and the changes brought about by the Flood, are in fact taken up by long, digressive discussions of why and how the Flood happened in the first place. In the respective passages, Hofer recapitulates much of the controversies of the preceding century, revealing himself as a late admirer of Thomas Burnet'sTelluris theoria sacra(1680/81) and John Woodward'sEssay toward a Natural History of the Earth(1695) in the process (e.g. pp. 174, 178). He alerts readers to his approach beforehand (p. 170) when stating that ""I have to insert certain observations regarding the Flood and its impact"" (interponendae mihi sunt observationes quaedam et diluvium et eius effectus concernentes), but one nonetheless often is in danger of losing track of his line of reasoning.Hofer himself is conscious of this shortcoming and the fact that it makes his text too long for its genre, as letters were traditionally supposed to be concise. He initially promises that he will avoid becoming overlong (p. 170,… ne transiliens dissertationis epistolaris limites crassum volumen conscribam …), but at the end has to admit that he was unable to keep his promise:Sed limites dissertationis epistolaris iam diu transii(p. 211). He also is concerned about stylistic questions, loathing the uncouth style in which the earth's prehistory has been discussed by most writers but fearing to lapse into it himself (p. 170). In fact, his Latin is neat and easy to understand but  exhibits the accumulation of unclassical abstract nouns and compounds typical of later scientific prose (already the title is a good example). Hofer also freely uses footnotes, which have become a common phenomenon in scientific papers by the mid-18th century. The epistolary character of his treatise, on the other hand, not only shows in the beginning and at the end, but also transpires in occasional addresses of the typeVIR EXCELLENTISSIME!in the main part (e.g. pp. 191, 204).Despite their somewhat confused presentation, Hofer's musings on the duration of human life before the Flood are an interesting work in terms of form and content alike. In the first respect, they testify to the generic freedom authors of journal articles still enjoyed around 1750. Contentwise, they not only are one of many discussions of natural questions posed by the text of the Bible, but also a specimen of environmental history and medicineavant la lettre.",,"Dissertatio epistolica de cancris et serpentibus petrefactis‎(← links)Hofer, Johann‎(← links)","Hofer, Johann:De possibilitate physica longaevitatis patriarcharum antediluvianorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_possibilitate_physica_longaevitatis_patriarcharum_antediluvianorum(last revision: 04.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The opening paragraph, styled in lengthy, elegant periods, encases the presentation of the topic and Bassi's approach to the problem in a first-person narrative of her thought process. Bassi presents her occupation with this specific problem as a chance idea (contigit). However, she makes clear that it resulted from the careful study of literature and thorough reflection on the centre of gravity. She addresses the difficulties of her subject matter and presents herself as overcoming these difficulties because of her faith in the analytical method. This faith gives her courage not only to tackle the problem she originally proposed, but also to attempt to generalise the problem. In the ensuing paper, however, Bassi progresses from the general to the specific.The language used to describe the mathematical solution to the proposed problem is technical and quite standardised. While most sentences are rather short, some longer periods can be found as well. With the help of differential calculus and geometric relations which are depicted in a sketch, Bassi derives several equations in order to solve the problem.

Modelling his account on the works of ancient biographers, especially on Suetonius'Lives of the Caesars, Cardano does not offer a pure autobiography in chronological order, but rather structures the work on different aspects of himself to depict his whole character: starting with his origin, his parents, his birth and a short summary of his most important life events, the author goes on to focus on his physical appearance, his health and physical activities, a quite unflattering account. He then explains his interests and his different achievements in the following chapters. While the work thus contains a wealth of scientific and philosophical considerations, as well as information on his scholarly network, a large part of it consists of intimate knowledge about Cardano's private life: his virtues and moral errors, his sex life, his piety and religious beliefs, rivalries in his different places of residence, the unfortunate fate of his son, who was condemned for murdering his wife and more.Cardano's autograph was discovered only in the 1640s by Gabriel Naudé and published by him with an introduction about Cardano's achievements and a list of his works. The editor also added a wealth oftestimoniaon Cardano by contemporary scholars, friends, colleagues, e.g. Julius Caesar Scaliger, many of them laudatory poems, after the main body of the work. He also appended another short work of Cardano from his library, hisDe Praeceptis ad filios libellus, which had been printed before, in Paris in 1635.

The letter comprises 24 pages and is divided into 38 paragraphs. The paragraphs in the middle of the letter deal mostly with different methods of measuring the transit, when it should be visible and at which places. These more technical passages are, however, framed by more parenetical paragraphes at the beginning and at the end of the letter. Here, Bošković highlights the importance of astronomical observations and stresses that the British are especially designated to undertake this task: First of all, because Edmond Halley has already predicted the Venus transit in 1716 (also in thePhilosophical Transactions). Then, there are so many important scientists of British origin who contributed to the knowledge of therespublica literaria. Furthermore, the British produce excellent telescopes and chronometers that are important for the observation. Most of all, Bošković appeals to the national pride: other nations – and the French in particular – have already sent out expeditions to observe the transit. The British should – according to Bošković – not let the French surpass them in this respect (this is expicitly stated, for example, in § 5 and § 36). It is therefore interesting to note that while Bošković mentions therespublica literariaand stresses that this endeavour will serve humankind as a whole, his strongest argument seems to point to the rivalry between England and France.Bošković was successful as the Royal Society really sent out expeditions (this is stated by Bošković himself in the commentary to hisDe solis ac lunae defectibus, p. 58f. note 14). He himself went to Istanbul as he already announces in this letter (§ 35) but came to late to observe the transit.
The letter is written in elegant Latin throughout. It is interesting to note that Bošković quotes 14 verses from book 2 (vv. 269–282) of his ownpoem on eclipseson pages 886f. (§ 34). The quotation in the letter features some slight changes from the published edition of the poem that appeared in 1760 as well. These verses were already written eight years before as Bošković states in the letter and in the auto-commentary of the poem (p. 58 n. 13).",,"Bošković, Ruđer Josip‎(← links)","Bošković, Ruđer Josip:De proximo Veneris sub sole transitu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_proximo_Veneris_sub_sole_transitu(last revision: 16.09.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,DB,

The present work forms part of that movement. In the second half of the century, the doctor and merchant Andreas Cleyer, who lived and worked in Batavia (present-day Jakarta) in the service of the Dutch East India Company, collected a number of translations of Chinese medical works and adaptions thereof made by one or several Europeans in China. He sent them to Frankfurt, where they were printed in 1682. The contents of the publication are described on its title page as follows:A Specimen of Chinese Medicine, or Short Medical Works According to the Chinese Understanding [of the Discipline]. Contents: I. Four Books on Pulses, Translated from the Chinese. II. Treatises on Pulses, Collected by a European Intellectual. III. Fragment of a Medical Work Composed at the Same Place [apparently somewhere in China] by a European Intellectual. IV. Extracts from Letters of a European Intellectual in China. V. Diagrams for the Better Understanding of the Preceding Texts. VI. On Signs of Diseases from the Colours and Conditions of the Tongue. With Coppers and Woodcuts. Edited by Andreas Cleyer from Kassel in Hesse, Licentiate of the Entire Field of Medicine, Chief Doctor, Director of the Pharmacy and Chirurgical Overseer of the Indian Society in New Batavia.This volume was among the earliest sources to provide Europe with some first-hand information about Chinese medicine. Apart from the title page, a dedication to the East India Company, and a short elegy in praise of Cleyer's achievement, there are no paratexts, and the ""European Intellectual(s)"" from the title page remain(s) anonymous. It is therefore unclear who is responsible for the translations and adaptations. The Jesuits Michał Piotr Boym and Philippe Couplet are sometimes named in this connection (e.g.Neue Deutsche Biographie3, 290;Walravens 2014, 297–298, 302–303), but this attribution is based on a confusion with theClavis medica ad Chinarum doctrinam de pulsibus(Nuremberg 1686), which is a work by Boym himself comprising only some extracts from Chinese pulse books and a different affair altogether. In any case, Cleyer did not translate the texts himself, as he had no Chinese.The first text of the collection is ascribed, to an author called Vám Xó Hó. This man presumably is the physician Wang Shuhe (around 300 AD) from the province of Shanxi, author of a famous sphygmological handbook called Maijing (modern English translation:Yang 1997). However, the work translated apparently has nothing to do with the Maijing except for the fact that it too discusses pulse diagnostics, and the attribution to Wang Shuhe must therefore be regarded as doubtful as well. The treatise appears to address itself to a prospective doctor. It comprises four books and 48 quarto pages in the translation, providing information on pulse taking, types of pulse and the relation of the pulse to various parts of the body. Moreover, it is explained how diseases can be diagnosed and the course of an illness predicted on the basis of the pulse. Parts of the work seem to have been in verse in the original, but appear as prose in the Latin version. Many simple diagrams try to visualize different kinds of pulses.Clearly, the translator had to face formidable difficulties. The Chinese text in front of the translator may have undergone many alterations over the centuries and in its present form appears to be the work of several hands. (Preliminary notes to books 3 and 4 seem to react to this state of things; they indicate that these books are not by Wang Shuhe – or the Yellow Emperor, the alleged author of theHuang Di Nei Jing, an older classic of Chinese medicine – but by doctorsex illorum doctrina, that is, from their school.) The template also may have undergone textual corruption. The visualization of the various pulses in the diagrams remains a mystery to the uninitiated. Above all, the work presupposes some knowledge of the Chinese conceptualization of the human body and its principles in general. The European reader who lacks this knowledge can do little more than making haphazard guesses regarding the meaning of the text. The respective problems become particularly evident in the technical terms, whose denotation is not identical with their meaning in everyday Chinese. It comes as no surprise that large parts of the Latin translation remain more or less incomprehensible. One can literally see the translator struggle with his task. His main strategy is to stay as close to the original as possible. Technical terms are translated literally, if feasible. What is called ""meridian"" today, for instance, is rendered asvia(“way”), ""qi"" becomesspiritus(""breath, gaseous substance""). In many cases, no adequate Latin word exists, and terms are simply transliterated. The various kinds of pulse appear asChin,Huonetc. Both strategies may also be combined: Our ""yin"" (the opposite of ""yang"") is rendered asyn seu humidum radicale(e.g. p. 32; ""yin or fundamental moist""). In many cases, not only single expressions, but the Chinese syntax at large was apparently obscure to the translator. The poems, for instance, are introduced by the strange formulaCarmen loquitur(""The poem speaks""), and a typical specimen of an ordinary text passage reads as follows (p. 34):De novem viarum pulsibusPrimus pulsus Cham seu longus est naturae yam seu caloris primigenii, digitus infra perquirens reperit in tribus locis instar hastae, cui quis innititur, cum elevatur est nimius; vocatur longus, transiliendo enim propriam sedem etiam appellatur longus; dominatur perturbationi corporis, est calidus; noctu aeger dormiens non quiescit.On the pulses of the nine ways (meridians)The first pulse, cháng or ""long"", is of the nature of yáng or the primordial heat, the finger which looks for it below finds it in three places, similar to a lance on which one steadies oneself when it rises, it is too much; it is called long, for on account of the fact that it overleaps its own place, it is also called long; it rules over the confusion of the body, it is warm; at night, the sick, while sleeping, finds no rest.What a contemporary European physician could have learned about Chinese medicine from such a translation is hard to say. Perhaps, however, he at least got an impression of a body of medical knowledge that was very different from his own but of comparable extent and sophistication.",,"Boym, Michał Piotr‎(← links)Wang, Shuhe‎(← links)Cleyer, Andreas‎(← links)Couplet, Philippe‎(← links)","Wang, Shuhe; Cleyer, Andreas:De pulsibus libri quattuor e Sinico translati, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_pulsibus_libri_quattuor_e_Sinico_translati(last revision: 02.07.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It was published after Regiomontanus’s death (1476) byJohannes Schöneras an appendix toDe triangulis omnimodisin 1533. This collection has a new title page with a Greek poem byJoachim Camerariuspraising Regiomontanus and his teacherPeurbach. In a letter toGeorg Tannstetter, Schöner describes how he found a small book (libellus) in Regiomontanus’s library containing the latter’s refutation of Cusanus’s construction and decided to dedicate its publication to Tannstetter. Schöner then goes on to tell the history of research on the squaring of the circle starting with Anaxagoras and gives an overview of the content of thelibellus.The collection is divided in two major parts containing various texts: The first part consists of several texts by Cusanus including his treatise on squaring the circle and probably also one byPaolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli.It begins with an epitome of Cusanus’s prose treatise on squaring the circle (p. 5–9, originalDe circuli quadraturafrom 1450). An interesting feature is the following dialogue (p. 10–12, originalDialogus de circuli quadraturafrom 1457), in which Nicolaus Cusanus lets his ownpersonaexplain his method of squaring the circle to Paulus, a physician from Florence, which can be identified as Cusanus’s friendToscanelli(cf.Zinner 1968, 123). Cusanus had written this dialogue in order to explain Toscanelli his thoughts and had also sent a copy to Regiomontanus's teacherGeorg von Peuerbach. The style of the dialogue is Platonic, in the sense that the contributions of the speakers are rather short and lively.The next text (p. 13–15) is a refutation of Cusanus's claims without title (starting withcapacitates omnium poligoniarum, probably by Toscanelli, cf.Zinner 1968, 123), followed by another treatise by Cusanus from 1462 (p. 16–21) entitledDe una recti curvique mensurawhich he had sent to Cardinal Bessarion who apparently passed it on to Regiomontanus.The second part (starting with p. 22), the ἐπιχειρήματα ποικίλα (the Greek words from the title page appear here again) form a comprehensive answer by Regiomontanus. This part is a collection of calculations, a dialogue, letters and treatises written in Venice in June and July 1464 as the colophons indicate. However, they are arranged in a rather unfortunate and confusing - and in particular not chronological - order by Schöner.The first text (p. 22–28) is another dialogue, in which Aristophilus and Critias discuss the squaring of the circle according to Cusanus, although he is only hinted at in the dialogue (his name is, however, mentioned in the title). The two speakers agree in the dialogue that one can falsify a squaring method if the proportion of the resulting circumference of the circle and the radius is not between 442/71 and 44/7, a result by Archimedes. The style of the dialogue is again Platonic and features some geometrical figures. More complex numbers are written in Latin in the text and indicated in Arabic numerals in the margins. The Greek colophon indicates that Regiomontanus has written it unluckily (δυστυχῶς) in Venice.The next text (p. 29–38) is the first of two letters to Toscanelli. After the short letter proper, it contains a treatise on the topic with references to Regiomontanus's trigonometricbook.The second letter (p. 56-58) dates to the 9th of July 1464 and contains the results of some tedious calculations (carried out on pp. 58-59, pp. 54-55 and pp. 67-82 with increasing accuracy) which proved Cusanus's squaring method wrong by showing that the resulting circumference is not in Archimedes's mentioned margins.Several other computations, treatises and letters are contained on the remaining pages (p. 39–93). At the end, there is a list of errata.The texts are written in good Latin, yet in the succinct style of mathematical texts. There are moreover several short Greek texts and many geometrical diagrams.","Zinner 1968, 121-124","Regiomontanus, Johannes‎(← links)Nikolaus, von Kues, Kardinal‎(← links)De circuli quadratura tandem adinventa et demonstrata‎(← links)Haec opera‎(← links)","Regiomontanus, Johannes;  Nikolaus, von Kues, Kardinal:De quadratura circuli, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_quadratura_circuli(last revision: 25.08.2021).",,"DB, MK, FB",Yes,"DB, FB",

He emphasizes that the method of fluxions does not depend on infinitesimals but rather on motion and presents the relationship of quadrature and differentation by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Furthermore, he adds a remark The main part consists of a very technical exposition of a formula for the integral of a huge class of functions expressed by power series, in particular all rational functions. This generalizes a result he had stated in the so-calledepistola posterior, his second letter toLeibniz. The main result being theorem IV, he adds several corollaries on some 20 pages. The treatise is concluded by a table of functions and their respective integrals. In thescholiumon page 207 he states a result which is explicitly formulated in 1715 by Brook Taylor, the ""Taylor series expansion"" of a function. By the late publication of the some twenty-years-old manuscript, many results had already been appeared elsewhere.

Some works based on Aldrovandi's material were later published by his pupils (cf. alsoSerpentum et draconum historia). The editor of the present work ontetrapodawith ""fingers"", that is, on vertebrates (excluding birds and fish) that have no hooves, but separate ""fingers"", was Bartholomaeus Ambrosinus.The volume contains three books on viviparous, and two on oviparous animals. It is opened by a dedicatory letter to Franciscus Perettus by Marco Antonio Bernia (F.), a book trader from Bologna who paid for the print, and a letter to the reader by Ambrosinus.
In book one of part one, Aldrovandi discusses “fera animalia, i.e. “wild animals” (like the lion, the bear, monkeys, the hippopotamus), in book two “semifera animalia(like different kinds of rodents, wolf, fox), and in book three “domestica animalia” (different kinds of dogs, cats). 
Part two contains two books on oviparous tetrapoda. These are divided according to the property of their “surface”. Those with a “skin-like” surface (“cute tegantur”), i.e. amphibians are dealt with in the first book, those with a “bark-like” surface (“cortice tegantur”), i.e. reptiles in the second book. 
Often, more than one modern species is included in one chapter, but, e.g. the dog suffering from rabies is treated as a different kind in the chapter after that on the “normal” dog. Animals from the New World are often treated as varieties of Old World species. Some new species, like the armadillo/tatou, the “simivulpa” (i.e. the opossum) or the “ignvavus” (i.e. the sloth), however, have a chapter on their own.
The extensive chapters of the different animals do not only deal with questions of biology like e.g. anatomy, physiology, nutrition, categorization, behavior, propagation, habitat, etc., but also with philology and (cultural) history. Every chapter starts passages on homonyms (aequivoca), synonyms and their etymology. Furthermore, Aldrovandi discusses topics such as miraculous behavior, prodigies, visions in dreams, morals, the use in mystics and allegory, hieroglyphs as well as proverbs, depictions on coins, military signs etc. and how humans used the animal. Many contemporary and ancient authorities are cited (including poets) in Latin and Greek. The loci are indicated in the margins.
There are usually one or more woodcuts for every animal including some drawings of skeletons. 
Indexes of different languages (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Spanish, German, French, etc.) are found at the end of the volume.","Asúa; French 2005, 197-203.","Aldrovandi, Ulisse‎(← links)","Aldrovandi, Ulisse:De quadrupedibus digitatis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_quadrupedibus_digitatis(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,DB,Yes,DB,

Nevertheless, his works found their way to an academic Latinate audience even before 1621, when Joachim Morsius, a German literary agent with alchemical interests, edited three short texts by Drebbel in Latin:On the Quintessence,Letter to King James Concerning the Invention of a Perpetuum Mobile, andOn the Nature of the Elements. However, Morsius's edition marks an important moment in the dissemination of Drebbel's writings in theres publica litteraria, as this was the first time they were committed to the printing press in a Latin guise.On the Quintessenceappears to be the first work of Drebbel that Morsius shared with his network. In the paratext of the printed edition, Morsius published his hasty letter to his friend Heinrich Nollius from March 1620, with which the treatise was originally enclosed (Nollius had already praised Drebbel in his textbooks of 1619, cf.Keller 2011, 145). In the letter, Morsius mentions his recent journey to England, presents the Drebbel's text as the first token of his own progress in the study of nature and hermetic medicine, and promises Nollius to send more gifts like this within the next months. Indeed, Morsius's first print of ""Drebbeliana"" comprised not onlyOn the Quintessence, but also theLetter to King James.In the paratext of the latter work, we learn more about the history of the former: Morsius receivedOn the Quintessencenot in England, but from a friend of Drebbel in Alkmaar, Ijsbrandt van Rietwijck, and published it without the author's knowledge, as he admits between the lines:Audaciae huius honestae, vel potius confidentiae amoris, auctor praeclare de me meritus, qui hactenus nihil mihi umquam denegavit, veniam quoque haud difficulter concedet.(""The author, who has been very kind to me and has never denied me anything so far, will also forgive me easily for this honest audacity, or rather for this confidence of love."")TheLetter to King Jamesis marked as a translation by the author:Sed quia neque Latine neque Anglice mentem meam satis exprimere possum, haec Belgice scripsi et in Romanam linguam verbotenus transferri curavi(""But because I cannot express my thoughts well enough in Latin or English, I wrote this in Dutch and had it translated into Latin word by word"", fol.C3r). Therefore, it seems likely thatOn the Quintessenceis a translation too, even though it is not stated explicitly in the text.The indicationbrevis tractatus– which appears only on the first page of the work, but not on the title page – is a very apt characterisation of Drebbel'sopusculum: this ""little treatise"" is only 17 pages long. The text can be divided into a more general half (chapter 1–4) and a practical half with recipes for the quintessence of gold, minerals, metals, plants and animals (chapter 5–8). This bipartite structure is marked in the text with a closing prayer at the end of chapter 4. Although the second part is much shorter (ca. 5 pages), it stands out because the chapters have a heading in addition to the chapter number (e.g.Caput VII. De quinta essentia vegetabilium). Perhaps this is an indication that the editor or printer expected the readers to be most interested in the concrete instructions on how to obtain the quintessence.The Latin sentences are often short and easy to read.Quinta essentiais often abbreviated toQ.E., pointing to an economic use of printing paper. At several points in the text, the technique of afictus interlocutoris employed. This imaginary conversation partner, or student, raises questions that the author then answers (e.g. fol. A3v:forte iam dices – respondeo, fol. A4r:iam vero quaeras – docebo). The recipes often give direct instructions to the reader in imperative form, sometimes intermixed with passive voice.The first edition ofOn the QuintessenceandLetter to King Jameswas followed by a second edition in the same year. This time, the volume also included a Latin translation of Drebbel'sOn the Nature of the Elements. A third edition was published seven years later. This rapid succession of editions shows the enthusiastic response of theres publica litterariato the Latin translation of Drebbel's works. Moreover, the Latin translation was a linchpin in their dissemination, as it was used as the basis for other vernacular translations in turn.

Divided by modern studies into three loose sections (Martinović 2002), de Dominis treats first of all the mathematical principles on which his investigation into optics will rely. In the second segment, he deals with the use of lenses, which brings him (apparently independently fromGalileo) to early developments of the theory of telescopes and their use as scientific instruments. The third part of the treatise, and by far the largest (pp. 43–78), is dedicated to a very detailed account of the phenomenon of rainbows - a topic widely debated at the time in its connection to the philosophy of light and optics (among sixteenth-century examples see, for instance,Della Porta'sDe refractione). Here de Dominis starts with an overview of the state of the art working through various theories, from Aristotle and his own Renaissance predecessors. Providing a detailed commentary on Aristotle'sMeteorologica, which was seen as the main source and starting point for the discussion, he eventually develops his own argument and brings to light the results of his research on the topic: thus, he comes up with the most convincing and fullest description of the phenomenon before Descartes (Scott 1952) and managed to successfully explain the formation of the interior bow. Although at the same time, he still did not grasp the problem of the secondary bow. Supplemented with numerous diagrams and supporting graphs, De Dominis’ approach to the study of the rainbow is now considered to have significantly contributed to Descartes’ later successful account.

Propositions four to seven deal with so-called ""problems of points"", a much-debated issue in the early modern era; the question is how to suitably distribute the prize of a prematurely aborted game between two players. This is extended to three or more players in propositions 8 and 9. Propositions 10 to 14 deal with dicing problems of various kinds. The propositions always present concrete numerical examples which are also solved for these special cases only; nevertheless, Huygens's general method of recursion becomes clear enough. Huygens closes his treatise with five problems which he partly supplies with their numerical solutions.Despite its shortness (only 14 pages),De ratiociniiswas the most important work on probability for around 50 years. Blaise Pascal'sTraité du triangle arithmétique(1665) was more comprehensive, but because van Schooten's book was more easily available and Huygens' work was written in Latin, it was more popular among European mathematicians.

Distillation handbooks began to appear from 1500, when Hieronymus Brunschwig published hisLiber de arte distillandi(a German book despite the Latin title). The present work, found on nine unnumbered folio pages appended to the fourth and final edition of Andrea Mattioli'sgreat Dioscorides commentary, focuses on the distillation of plants, as announced by its full title:Short Treatise on the Method of Distilling Waters from All Plants and How the True Scents Can Be Preserved in These Waters.The treatise was taken over intothe 1598 edition of Mattioli'sOpera omniaand has been ascribed to Mattioli ever since. This ascription is provisionally accepted in the present entry, but only faute de mieux. As far as is known at the moment, the text is first attested in 1562 in a Czech version of Mattioli's commentary (Stannard 1969, 80 n. 72) and could thus be the work of a Czech author, which was subsequently latinized. Moreover, Mattioli seems to show little if any interest in distillation otherwise. The text itself is of no great help for the question of authorship since it references German as well as Italian practices and circumstances.The work falls into two parts. The first, theoretical one, which fills two folio pages, discusses the distillation of plants in general and the advantages and disadvantages of different methods. It initially narrates the invention of the technique and its refinement over time, including the building of distillation ovens, the replacement of leaden by copper and glass vessels, the design of various vessel types, and the invention of special techniques, whose advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Distillation has progressed so far nowadays, the author states, that distillates may preserve the full scent, taste, and medical powers of their source materials. The usefulness of distilled waters as drugs, perfumes, and cosmetics are praised. Finally, the author highlights that a doctor's success partly depends on his expertise in this field. The second part of theShort Treatisepresents six woodcuts of as many types of distillation ovens, some of them quite sophisticated and equipped with a large number of distillation vessels. Each illustration is accompanied by a short explanation.The author (or translator) writes a well-readable, syntactically classical Latin.

Written in sophisticated and refined Latin, theDe rebus coelestibusabounds in references to classical astrological authors. Pontano explores the positions of the planets, their conjunctions, and the possible applications of astro-medical knowledge. The treatise reflects Pontano's strategy of relying exclusively, at least openly, on Roman and Greek authors and avoiding the Islamic astrological tradition, which purportedly misinterpreted Ptolemy and other leading authorities in astrological matters. This puts Pontano into a larger context of the debates on the validity of Islamic natural philosophical and scientific sources that arose at the time in Italy (e.g.Leoniceno'sDe Plinii erroribus). However, a more detailed analysis shows that despite the claim, in both theDe rebus coelestibusand his other astrological texts, Pontano still significantly draws on Ptolemy's Islamic commentators.De rebus coelestibushas a long publication history. First composed in the 1470s, it was enlarged by Pontano himself in the 1490s in response toGiovanni Pico della Mirandola'sDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricemin which Pico criticized astrology as incompatible with natural data as well as personally attacked Pontano for mistranslating Ptolemy'sCentiloquium. However, the passages containing negative remarks on Pico were deleted in the posthumous edition of 1512 made by Pontano's follower Pietro Summonte and survived only in manuscript form. The 1530 edition, by Andreas Cratander in Basel, is the most detailed and well prepared and contains a thorough index that allows the reader to find what he is looking for in the body of the text.","Akopyan 2021, 192–195","Pontano, Giovanni Gioviano‎(← links)Urania‎(← links)","Pontano, Giovanni Gioviano:De rebus coelestibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_rebus_coelestibus(last revision: 05.11.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

After 1416 when Poggio Bracciolini rediscovered the ancient poem in the library of the monastery of St. Gallen in Switzerland, Manilius became a regular point of reference in both art and poetry. Thus, it inspired the iconographic program of the cycle of frescoes in Ferrara's famous Palazzo Schifanoia. In poetry, on the other hand, the reception of Manilius culminated in the work of Bonincontri.Bonincontri was widely recognised as one of the leading humanists of his time. His fame owned him a series of prestigious positions at various courts across Italy, including Naples where he got to know Giovanni Pontano whom Bonincontri's poetic humanism influenced heavily. In the 1470s, Bonincontri settled in Tuscany and was introduced to the humanist circles of Florence and Pisa. For some years, he taught Manilius' poem at the Studio Fiorentino and left a lengthy commentary on it. This prepared him for a new step he took in the mid-1480s. The exact dating of theDe rebus coelestibusis unknown but Bonincontri seems to have worked on it between 1484 and 1487. The outcome was an elegant poem that, alongsideBasinio da Parma'sAstronomicon libri duoandGiovanni Pontano'sUrania, exemplifies the genre of astrological poetry in the Italian Renaissance.
The poem consists of three books. The first avoids astrological topics and, in a classicised manner, narrates Creation, Christ's Passions and other central events of Biblical history. The astrological narrative kicks off in the second book, making astrology the main theme of the rest of the poem. The seven planets are divided between Books 2 and 3, according to their location relative to Earth (as imagined at that time): the Moon, Mercury and Venus are described in the second book, while the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are featured in Book 3.
In terms of style and content, Bonincontri masterfully imitates his ancient role model in describing the astrological characteristics of, and natural events associated with, each planet. The Latin is refined and clear. As testified in the preface to the 1540 edition, theDe rebus coelestibuswas first printed in 1526 by Aldus Manutius.

Developed in a way throughout Zabarella's life, the treatise, based on his university lectures at Padua, was published posthumously in 1590. It was reprinted several times in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries and contributed to its author's European fame. Thus, Pierre Bayle labelled Zabarella ""one of the greatest philosophers of the century"".In contrast to what is usually - and mistakenly - associated with the ""conservatism"" of Renaissance Aristotelianism,De rebus naturalibusrepresents a significant step towards the formation of early modern scientific method. First touched upon in his earlierOn MethodsandOn Regressus, the problem in question found its full justification inOn Natural Things. According to the regressus method described in detail in Zabarella's opus magnum, the natural philosopher should first infer from the known effect the existence of the cause of this very effect. By applying two layers of what is understood as ""scientific investigation"", that isdemonstratio quia(demonstration from the fact) anddemonstratio propter quod(demonstration from the reasoned fact), Zabarella drastically reformulates the main principle of reasoning and thus puts the authority of Aristotle (or that of any other philosopher) below ""reason"". Although Zabarella does not distinguish ""experience"" and ""experiment"", he puts forth and advocates a new approach to nature based on the observation of verified facts instead of relying on the authority, or in some cases, correcting the facts in order to reconcile them with the authority. It is well known that Zabarella's discourse on the method had a major influence on the whole subsequent tradition of philosophical debates on the status of method and scientific investigation including Galileo.
The form of Zabarella's treatise remains typical for the genre of traditional scholastic texts taught at medieval and Renaissance universities, At the same time, unlike many similar contemporary works of the same type and given the nature of the treatise itself, his style is very clear, with the quality of the Latin prose being relatively high. Marking a ""humanist"" turn in the university tradition, Zabarella acquired the reputation of a prominent Latin and, more importantly, Greek scholar. This reflects in an extensive use of Greek commentators of the Philosopher.
The treatise consists of 30 books, which, according to Zabarella's idea, are supposed to cover a whole variety of natural philosophical topics.",Mikkeli 1992Zabarella 2016,"Zabarella, Giacomo‎(← links)Mathesis iuvenilis‎(← links)","Zabarella, Giacomo:De rebus naturalibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_rebus_naturalibus(last revision: 08.10.2021).",,,Yes,OA,

Its author can be identified as Gian Girolamo Sbaraglia. Hisdissertatio epistolicais an attack on modern medical practice, anatomy and comparative anatomy (of both animals and plants) in particular. Although his name is never mentioned in the text, the work is mostly directed atMarcello Malpighi, one of the foremost Italian anatomists and microscopists of his time, and moreover, Sbaraglia’s colleague at the university of Bologna. Malpighi’s and Sbaraglia’s feud was not only on scientific grounds but they had personal issues as Malpighi’s brother had killed Sbaraglia’s in 1659 (Meli 2007, 169). Sbaraglia quotes Seneca’s famous saying from the beginning ofDe vita beata(1.3) that it is most harmful just to follow the opinion of the majority (Atqui nulla res nos maioribus malis inplicat quam quod ad rumorem componimur, optima rati ea, quae magno adsensu recepta sunt, quorum exempla bonis multa sunt, nec ad rationem sed ad similitudinem vivimus). Sbaraglia, who fashions himself as an adherent of the empirical school of medicine, thinks that anatomical studies do not contribute anything useful for the healing of patients and thus physicians should not concentrate on these studies, but rather on the physicians’ experience. Not even Harvey’s description of the blood circulation is regarded as helpful (p. 21). Sbaraglia quotes many ancient and modern authors, not only physicians and scientists, but also philosophical authors like Seneca or Cicero and poets like Hesiodus. Quotations from Greek texts appear only in translation. The text is well readable and written in good Latin with comparably few technical terms.The letter of 42 pages is dated 13 September 1687 and allegedly signed in Göttingen (Gottingae), but it was probably printed only in 1689 and in Bologna (Marzolla 1990, 165;Meli 2007, 165). Moreover, the author initially did not publish it openly and for sale, but let it circulate among his friends (Meli 2007, 169).Malpighi’s reply (Risposta/Responsio) to this work, in which he refuted Sbaraglia’s text paragraph by paragraph, was not published during his lifetime (he died in 1694) but it was included in hisOpera posthumapublished in 1697 by the Royal Society (Marzolla 1990andMeli 2007deal mostly with this texts). The text is printed in two columns with the Italian version to the left and the Latin translation to the right starting on page99. TheResponsiowas again answered by Sbaraglia. With time, also others joined the debate (seeMeli 2007, 165 for an overview). Already in 1691, Johann Bohn from Leipzig had answered to Sbaraglia’sdissertation epistolicain hisPraedilectiones therapeuticas.

The first version of the treatise entitled theDe natura iuxta propria principia liber primus et secundusappeared in 1565. The second edition of 1570 contains some revisions: while in the main body of the treatise Telesio had slightly developed his argument, at the same time he deleted a long introduction of his own, which prefaced the first edition. The last and most substantial edition of nine books (instead of two books in the 1565 and 1570 editions) dates from 1586 and is structured as follows: in the first four books, Telesio repeats his argument previously condensed in two books; other five books discuss new material not covered in the previous editions of theDe rerum natura.A fervent opponent of the Aristotelian tradition and Galenic medicine, Telesio proposes his own natural philosophical system in which he replaces the Aristotelian principles of matter and form with passive matter and active force the latter of which is twofold - heat and cold. Assuming that God had created two opposite primary globes, the cold Earth and the Sun considered the seat of heat, Telesio goes on to claim that all natural things result from the confrontation of the two forces and are different depending on the amount of heat and cold they have. Abolishing the main categories of the Aristotelian philosophy, namely the motion of the sky, the two principles of matter and form and the prime mover, Telesio concludes that all natural things act only in accordance with their own nature and are not created and influenced by any external element. This also applies to the primary forces. To recognise their nature caused either by cold or by heat, the forces as well as all other natural things have senses of perception.
According to Telesio who firmly rejected the traditional interpretation of the subject in question, sense organs are nothing but organs and are not, in fact, responsible for any sense perception. Telesio provides a more naturalistic and ""neuroscientific"" explanation of the phenomenon by claiming that sense perception is a sensation of sensing (sensus sensus), which takes place in the brain. He argues that human brain receives impulses from the external world and thus determines one's sensory perception. This leads Telesio to a conclusion that empiricism based on sense perception is the only way to cognise nature.
Telesio's work was extremely influential at the time. His severe criticism of Aristotle, revolutionary aspects of his natural philosophy and the theory of knowledge were widely recognised by Telesio's contemporaries.

It has thus long been recognized as a milestone in the history of science and a surviving autograph manuscript was recommended for inclusion in UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in 1999. Copernicus dedicated the book to Pope Paul III.The work was published in 1543, the year of Copernicus's death. Rheticus had visited Copernicus, learned and written about his heliocentric system (in 1540 publishedNarratio prima) and finally brought the manuscript to Nuremberg. There Andreas Osiander added an introductory remarkAd lectorem de hypothesibus huius operiswhich he planned to be attributed to Copernicus and which is therefore unsigned. Therein Osiander weakens the main statements in the book, denying that the presented model reflects reality but has to be viewed as a purely mathematical model improving the forecast of phenomena and alleviating considerations. This contradicts everything else written in the six books. Copernicus's friend, bishop Tiedemann Giese, called this an infamous betrayal of Petrejus on Copernicus. Although Kepler seems to have had knowledge of Osiander being the author of this introduction, it was later assigned to an overcautious Copernicus who had hesitated to publishDe revolutionibusat all.This introduction is followed by a letter of Nicolaus Schonberg, Cardinal of Capua, to Copernicus, and the dedication letter to Pope Paul III in which Copernicus explains how he considered a moving earth. Mentioning the well-known flaws of Ptolemy's system, especially the different theories for the planets, his attempts to present a theory on unified principles for all of them, and the reading of philosophers of antiquity (Cicero and Plutarch) lead him to the heliocentric model and a moving earth. He finishes his letter noting that many laymen of astronomy and mathematics enter astronomical debates ridiculing serious science. But mathematics 
is made for mathematicians and finally for the benefit of the Holy Roman Church which is in need of an improvement of its calender.After the introductory material, Copernicus set out theDe revolutionibus orbium coelestiumin six books. Book I offers an overview of his heliocentric theory and paints in broad strokes his revolutionary cosmology: The celestial bodies move in perpetual and regular spheres. The earth rotates on its axis and goes around the sun. The axis furthermore describes a movement called ""precession"" which is only notable through centuries and responsible for the calender shift. It furthermore describes the natural implications of the view: The daily motions of all stars follow from the motion of earth around is axis. The motion of the sun through the ecliptic is merely the earths motion around the sun changing its background. The ""retrograde motion"" of the planets on the ecliptic finally is a consequence of earth overtaking them in their orbits. He alsopresents an orderof the planets and identifies the moon as the Earth's satellite. 
The second half of Book I is dedicated to basic mathematical notions and methods of spherical trigonometry. There he curiously uses the expression ""half chord of the double arc"" which is nothing but the sine function whose notion was actually already widely used and known.In the remaining five books, he then mathematically fills out the picture depicted in the first half of book I. Book II describes the basic concepts of astronomic notions and includes a lists of stars and constellations. In the third book, he deals with the movement of the sun while in the fourth he covers the movement of the moon. Books V and VI deal with the  the other five known planets’ movements. Though critical for advancing our understanding of astronomy, in his explanations of the celestial bodies’ movements Copernicus still relied on Ptolemaic epicyclical models in order to describe their positions precisely.",Nobis and Sticker 1984Gingerich 2002Lerner et al. 2015,"Narratio prima‎(← links)Epitoma in Almagestum Ptolemaei‎(← links)Kopernikus, Nikolaus‎(← links)Sol siderum princeps‎(← links)In Sphaeram Ioannis de Sacrobosco commentarius‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Mathesis iuvenilis‎(← links)In opus revolutionum Nicolai Copernici Torunnaei dialogus‎(← links)Prutenicae tabulae‎(← links)In Ptolemaeum et Copernicum duo naturae miracula‎(← links)Aristarchi Samii De mundi systemate‎(← links)In effigiem Nicolai Copernici‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae‎(← links)Mysterium cosmographicum‎(← links)Almanach novum atque correctum super anno Domini 1510‎(← links)Philolaus‎(← links)","Kopernikus, Nikolaus:De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium(last revision: 21.02.2022).","Printer’s GND entry:http://d-nb.info/gnd/118740334Interessant die kurze Anrede an den Leser auf dem Titelblatt:

In books 2–6, the idea of a moving earth is mentioned time and again, and it is stated that easier explanations of the phenomena can be given on that basis. However, the work contains loads of observational data, esp. in the form of tables, that are useful to any astronomer regardless of his creed. Moreover, the overall structure results in a systematic description of the solar system, not in a systematic advocacy of the solar system. In this sense, the work can be called a pandect.

It does not deal with dew in the modern sense only, but also with substances that arise from dew – at least according to the author’s theories. After the letter of dedication and the notice of the printer to the reader, there is a plethora of dedicatory poems, mostly in Latin, but also in Italian, and even an anagram with the name of the author and relating to the content:Ioannes Nardius Medicus – O Dives Iris Manna Ducens(“Giovanni Nardi, physician – O godly Iris [rainbow] bringing Manna”). The main treatise comprises 54 chapters and some 200 pages. The first chapters (1–21) deal with Nardis theories about the origin, development, physical properties, and nature of dew. In accordance with his workDe igne subterraneothat he has published the year before, Nardi thinks that dew developed out of thesuccus dulcis(“sweet juice”) of the Earth that evaporates due to the subterranean fire and finally condenses as dew (chapt. 14, p. 46–48).As he thinks, that this dew is “sweet”, he discusses in the following further substances that are related to or derived from dew. Already in antiquity, honey was thought to fall down to earth as a kind of dew (“honeydew”). Nardi hence discusses honey, its origins, kinds, properties, its use as food and in medicine (chapt. 22–35). He then goes on to discuss Manna (chapt 36–42) and sugar (chapt. 43–45) in the same way. After this follows a chapter (46), in which Nardi tries to refute supposedmonstraof dew (such as diseases allegedly stemming from dew). A bigger part (chapt. 47–51) deals with the Manna that the Israelites found on their way through the desert in bookExodusand Nardi tries to find some natural explanations for this wonder. The final chapters (52–54) are about pearls that according to Nardi are also a substance related to dew.
Nardi mostly discusses written sources, often from antiquity, and also the bible, but at times he refers to more recent authorities such as Averroes, Pierre Bellon, orGeorgius Agricola. He does not only quote from scientific texts in the narrower sense but very often also from poetry (e.g. Vergil, Pindar, Homer). Greek texts are sometimes printed in Greek, but they always come with a Latin translation. References can be found in the margins.

He published a number of physicotheological works and sermons, most of which were written in German, like hisLithotheologie,Insecto-TheologiaandTestaceo-Theologia. The language of the present physico-theological letter to the Dutch pharmacist and collector Albert Seba, however, is in Latin. Written as a gift for Seba's 70th birthday, the letter explains how the wisdom, omnipotence and providence of God can be detected in the design of insects. The topic of insects was one that Seba and Lesser shared: in 1735, Seba was working on the publication of theinsect sectionof his natural history collection (fol. A2r–v), while Lesser was intending to publish hisInsecto-Theologia(fol. B3v–4v).Theepistolaris disquisitio(""disquisition in letter form"") comprises 14 quarto pages and is divided into eight numbered paragraphs. §1 and §8 form the epistolary framework: §1 introduces the addressee, occasion and topic of the letter, §8 closes the letter with birthday wishes to the addressee. In the main body of the text, the author first turns to the external parts of insects and describes the marvelous variety and structure of the head (§2), body (§3) and feet (§4) of insects. After reflecting on the beauty and smallness of insects (§5), he briefly describes the marvels of the interior parts of insects (§6). Bringing the letter to a close, Lesser announces that he is about to publish a whole book on the theology of insects and provides an overview over its contents (§7).Lesser's birthday gift to Seba was conceived as a public letter from the outset: it is described as apublicum documentumin the opening paragraph (fol. A2r). Consequently, the letter is addressed as much to Seba as it is to other readers whom Lesser hopes to convince that the study of insects is worthwile as a physico-theological exercise:verum si sequentia perlegent, forsitan aliter sentient spero, nisi plane stipites sint(""But if they read the following, I hope that they will perhaps change their mind, unless they are idiots through and through"", fol. A2v).The overall tone of the letter is enthusiastic. The assertion that God is manifest in the insects' design is repeated again and again throughout the letter, and expressions of wonder abound in the text (e.g. forms ofmirari, mirus, admirabilis, admiratio). In terms of content, the letter creates a global impression of the marvelous and purposeful variety in insects. It enumerates and describes the various forms and functions of eyes, antennae, stings, colours etc. without, however, matching certain forms to certain species. Thus, as the letter demonstrates how the greatness of God can be detected in the tiniest creatures, it also provides a very general overview over the characteristics of insects.","Trepp 2009, 373–466","Lesser, Friedrich Christian‎(← links)","Lesser, Friedrich Christian:De sapientia, omnipotentia et providentia divina ex partibus insectorum cognoscenda, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_sapientia,_omnipotentia_et_providentia_divina_ex_partibus_insectorum_cognoscenda(last revision: 24.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,IT,
"Linden, Johannes Antonides van der","De scriptis medicis libri duo, quibus praemittitur ad dominum Petrum Tulpium manuductio ad medicinam",,1637,Amsterdam,Blaeu,17th century,"Textbook, Bibliography",Medicine,"De scriptis medicis libri duo(1637) (Google Books) –  Alternative links:archive.org,MDZLindenius renovatus(1686) (Google Books) – Alternative links:archive.org,e-rara.ch,MDZ","631363(Amsterdam 1637)1085290(Lindenius renovatus, Nuremberg 1668)","As the scientific discipline with the strongest institutional background and the greatest number of practitioners by far, medicine quite logically was the first to develop a bibliographical tradition of its own. TheTwo Books on Medical Writingsby Johannes Antonides van der Linden, a Dutch physician and younger friend of Nicolaes Tulp (Rembrandt's Dr Tulp), are a prominent specimen of this tradition. In fact, the author places himself firmly in it by recognising as his predecessors (fol. *2v)Johann Georg Schenck(with hisBiblia iatrica), Israel Spach (Nomenclator scriptorum medicorum, 1591), Pascal Le Coq (Bibliotheca medica, 1590) and the arch-bibliographerConrad Gessner(Bibliotheca universalis).As indicated in the title, the work falls into two books. Book one (pp. 1–470), which is more than five times longer than book two, provides a list of medical authors (and editors) in alphabetical order. Under each name, the respective publications are indicated with their full title, place, publisher, year, and format. In the case of classical authors, recent editions are given preference. Book two (pp. 471–559) provides a thematically structured overview of the whole of medicine, which is divided into its various parts and aspects by means of 37 headings and several hundred subheadings. Because the main headings provide an interesting insight into the way in which a 17th-century physician mentally structured his discipline, they are listed in an appendix to this entry. The main categories are subdivided according to practical aspects, which is why the resulting subcategories often appear somewhat incongruous from a systematic point of view. UnderEccrimologica(the science of excretion), for instance, one findsexcrementa(""excrements""),sudor(""sweat""),sudor sanguineus(""bloody sweat""),coitus(""sexual intercourse""),lacrimae(""tears"") andplenitudo(""full feeling""). The authors enumerated in book one are filed under these categories.TheTwo Books on Medical Writingsare concluded by a name index and preceded by a one-page letter to the reader in which the work's structure is explained. Even before that, one finds an interesting short treatise of some 50 pages titledManuductio ad medicinam(literally ""Leading One to Medicine by the Hand"") and addressed to the eldest son of Nicolaes Tulp, Pieter, who was nineteen and a student of medicine at the time. ThisManuductiomay be seen as a greatly extended version of a dedication to the Tulps or as a replacement for it. It constitutes a concise guide to the study of medicine, including an overview of the essential literature in the discipline's various subfields, as they are presented in book two, a course of studies stretching over three or four years, and a number of practical hints, for instance regarding note-keeping or the invention of fictional cases, for which a fitting treatment is then worked out. The text may be compared toPedro de Castro'sBibliotheca medici eruditi, which was however published as a self-contained book.The single parts of van der Linden's book complement each other and form a well-ordered whole, which could be used not only as a work of reference by doctors and as a first introduction to medicine by students at the same time. (The only nuisance must have been the fact that the authors are ordered by first name in both books, which leads to endless lists ofIoannesand other common first names, while the index, where they are ordered by last name, lacks page numbers. In this, van der Linden seems to follow Gessner'sBibliotheca universalis.) The two introductory texts are written in a crisp, snappy Latin that reads well and keeps the reader's attention. It comes as no surprise that the work enjoyed considerable success. A second and a third edition appeared in 1651 and 1662. In 1686, Abraham Merklin published an updated and rearranged version, theLindenius renovatus(Symons 1990, 244).Appendix: the structure of medicine according to the main headings of book 2MEDICINAMEDICORUMVETERINARIAEMPIRICADOGMATICATHEORETICAPHYSIOLOGICAANATOMICAPATHOLOGICANOSOLOGICAAETIOLOGICASYMPTOMATICASEMEIOTICADIAGNOSTICAUROCRITICASPHYGMICAONEIROCRITICAPHYSIOGNOMICACHIROMANTICAPROGNOSTICAPRACTICADIASOSTICAAEROLOGICASITIOLOGICAHYPNOLOGICAGYMNASTICAECCRIMOLOGICAPATHOLOGICACOSMETICAPROROGATIOTHERAPEUTICASPECIALISDIAETETICAPHARMACEUTICACHIRURGICAMETHODICACHEMICAPARACELSICA",,"Bibliotheca universalis‎(← links)Linden, Johannes Antonides van der‎(← links)Bibliotheca medici eruditi‎(← links)Ordo et ordinis ratio in legendis Hippocratis et Galeni libris‎(← links)Institutiones medicinae‎(← links)","Linden, Johannes Antonides van der:De scriptis medicis libri duo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_scriptis_medicis_libri_duo(last revision: 25.07.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The dissertationOn the Language of Animalstaps into this debate and argues – in accordance with Aristotle – that animals are not able to speak to humans or to each other, except that they are able to express feelings (generales affectus, § 26, fol. C4r). The dissertation was written by thepraesesJohann Gabriel Drechsler and defended by therespondensPolycarp Michael Rechtenbach. The title page announces the date of the defensio as 7th April 1673. However, in some copies, the date is overprinted to read 3rd April 1673 (this is also the case in the digital copy). About thirty years after the original publication in Leipzig, a second edition appeared in Erfurt in 1706, indicating that the topic met with some interest from contemporary readers.In terms of structure and style, the short dissertation is a typical example of the genre. It is neatly structured into 26 numbered paragraphs, which vary in length between a few lines and approximately two pages. The first part is occupied with defining the central termsbrutum(§§ 1–4) andsermo(§§ 5–6). The dissertation then announces the central question whether animals can speak and states that this is not the case (§ 7). This statement is followed by an account of talking animals in various sources ranging from ancient literature and the bible to early modern testimonies (§§ 8–18). After presenting a wide variety of examples from Balaam's ass to Henry VIII's parrot, these instances are either explained as caused by the devil or by other external causes (God) or dismissed as unreliable testimonies or wrong interpretations of rhetorical or poetic figures (§§ 19–24). Towards the end (§ 25), the dissertation turns away from the question whether animals can talk in human languages and touches upon the question whether animals have their own language in which they talk to each other. However, this question is answered in the negative as well. The dissertation concludes that since animals are not rational creatures, they can only express feelings, but cannot communicate concrete thoughts, and therefore do not possess speech (§ 26).The Latin is easy to read, if mostly a bit dry. As in many dissertations, a big part of the text consists of quotations and paraphrases from a wealth of sources that includes ancient poetry and prose as well as early modern authors likeKaspar Schott,Conrad GessnerandUlisse Aldrovandi. Greek and Hebrew quotes are rendered in the respective alphabets, but always accompanied by a Latin translation. Since a few birds discussed in the dissertation talk in the vernacular, a few German and English quotes appear in the Latin text too. The collection of examples in the middle part of the dissertation contains several vivid descriptions. The description of the behaviour of ants, bees and spiders in particular is a small stylistic gem, with rhetorical figures like anaphora, tricolon, antithesis and exclamation (§4, fol. A3r–v).The dissertation is framed as a religious text, opening with the exclamationIn nomine Jesu!and concluding with a short prayer at the end. It is easily navigable thanks to headings in the margins of the text. Seven short congratulatory poems fill up the last leaf of the print. In the second edition, these poems were omitted.",Roling 2011Roling 2013b,"Drechsler, Johann Gabriel‎(← links)Rechtenbach, Polycarp Michael‎(← links)","Drechsler, Johann Gabriel; Rechtenbach, Polycarp Michael:De sermone brutorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_sermone_brutorum(last revision: 07.02.2022).","In §13, fol.

These are, namely, the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality, the principle of lateral continuity, and the principle of cross-cutting relationships.This geological work was related, in Steno’s thought here, with other research which now seems quite unconnected: as the title says, research towards understanding how solids appeared ‘naturally’ within other solids. This included, for Steno, questions about organs within the body, fossils within rocks, and – what we now understand as his stratigraphical work – layers of rock within mountains. This means that Steno'sProdomusalso offers alongside these geological arguments, important developments in crystallography (Steno describes what we now know as Steno's Law of Constant Angles) as well as paleontology (the Prodromus attests confidently that fossils are in fact imprints of once-living things).That Stensen's work met with considerable interest is evinced by an English translation and a second edition of the Latin original, published in 1671 and 1679 respectively.","Maar 1910, vol. 2, 181–226 (Latin edition)Kardel; Maquet 2013, 621–660 (English translation with notes)","Stensen, Niels‎(← links)","Stensen, Niels:De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_solido_intra_solidum_naturaliter_contento(last revision: 22.12.2021).","In Maar's and Kardel&Maquet's eds., the plate at the end is well visible, other than in the online copies of the original.Der Ursprung der Berge wird pp. 637ff.

In the dedication letter, he mentions parts of his career, which has led him to Lyon, Pisa, Naples, and Rome. The work lays out Argenterio's opinion on the nature, differences, causes, and powers of sleep as well as wakefulness on 334 pages. The author, called ""alter Galenus"" in one of the three panegyric poems introducing the text, criticises ancient medical authorities, above all Galen, for the unsatisfactory description of the character and causes of sleep and sleeplessness. Because both sleep and wakefulness can be both nocuous and beneficial for the human and animal body, such a detailed study is, as Argenterio explains, necessary.First, Argenterio relates Aristotle's ideas about the causes and nature of sleep and vigil, whom he sees as most important authority on the subject. He explains Aristotle's opinion of sleep and dream resulting fromantiperistasis, a process, where one quality interacts with another: vapour is produced during digestion and transported into the brain, where it is converted into a hot liquid, that is able to cause both sleep and dreams. Then, the author goes on to present Galen's opinion on the topic and criticises his idea of sleep caused by the interactions of the three spirits, natural, vital, and animal, residing in the liver, heart, and brain, respectively, an opinion taken up by many later physicians. After relating more recent writings, Argenterio lays out his own theses about sleep and wakefulness, ignoring Galen and identifying the cause as one vital spirit, or innate heat (calidus nativus), residing in the heart and blood, and distributed through the blood into the whole body. This heat influences the organs and thus causes both sleep and vigil.
Argenterio's treatise also discusses health problems caused by sleep and wakefullness: as the whole body falls asleep, and not only the brain or the heart, remedies for problems with both too much or too little sleep also have to effect the whole body and not just parts of it.
The work also speaks about dreams and divides them into two types, intrinsic and extrinsic: animal and corporeal dreams, pertaining to the soul (anima) and body (corpus).Somnia animaliaare caused by experiences of the soul, which are repeated in the dream, e.g. things seen, heard, or thought of during waking hours. Corporeal dreams are, by contrast, caused by changes in the qualities of the body.Argenterio's treatise on sleep and vigil was re-issued in Paris two years after the first publication.

Although Liceti's commitment to Aristotelian teaching remained unshaken throughout his career, he should not be regarded as a pure dogmatist. Evidence suggests he was responsive to contemporary intellectual trends, and theDe spontaneo viventium ortuis a good example of how, in polemicizing with competing philosophers, Liceti adjusted Aristotelian doctrines to his needs. TheDe spontaneo viventium ortu, published in 1618 in Vicenza, consists of four books and is divided into 151 chapters. Its structure follows the Aristotelian theory of four causes, based respectively on finality, form, matter, and agent (Hirai 2011:125). Liceti structures his argument as though in response to how his predecessors understood the generation of living beings. That is why, along with medieval authors, including Albertus Magnus andAvicenna, he overviews the theories put forth by neoterics such asGirolamo Cardano, Marcantonio Zimara andAndrea Cesalpino. However, Liceti's main target isMarsilio Ficino's idea of the World Soul, mainly expressed in hisPlatonic Theology. The solution Liceti proposes is to not denounce the Platonic interpretation of the generation of the natural world but rather to combine various elements taken from the three main competing traditions, those of Aristotelianism, Platonism, and Stoicism. Thus, firmly loyal to the Aristotelian theory of causes, he adapts the Platonic/Ficinian notion of the world soul for his interpretative purposes. Liceti claims that Aristotle, in fact, endorsed the idea of the world soul, which should be seen as the Creator Himself. He then goes on to bring this understanding of the world soul close to the Stoic notion of pneuma. The world soul, conceived as intellect separated from matter, serves as the general principle behind any generation of living beings, including spontaneous. At the same time, it is not the immediate agent of natural events - that is the point where Liceti introduces the division of causes and souls in accordance with Aristotle's natural philosophy. In this manner, Liceti attains his aim to substantiate the claims that, regardless of novel developments, the principles of Aristotelian philosophy remain valid for the most accurate description of natural things.",Hirai 2011,"Liceti, Fortunio‎(← links)De monstris‎(← links)","Liceti, Fortunio:De spontaneo viventium ortu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_spontaneo_viventium_ortu(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,,Yes,OA,

Four years afterwards, in 1532, Joachim Camerarius published his Latin translation of books 1 and 2.

A volume comprising both translations was printed by Charles Périer in Paris in 1557.On the title page of the translation of the first two books, Camerarius describes his work to a reader in four elegiac couplets. First of all, he begs forgiveness for any mistakes in Latin that might have caused his “German right hand” (si qui forte leges Germanae audacia dextrae/scripta per Ausonios currere iussa sonos,/da veniam erratis […]). The novelty and unparalleledness of this work should reconcile the reader, as there was no predecessor whose steps he could follow. While Dürer’s work is accompanied by a letter to Willibald Pirckheimer, Camerarius's translation features several paratexts. Camerarius first addresses the reader and presents Dürer’s work and his biography. Moreover, he highlights that Dürer’s ideas and techniques are now available not only to Germans but also to other nations through his Latin translation. A second letter is addressed to Christopher Colerus of whom it is said that he has asked Camerarius to prepare this translation. Camerarius furthermore speaks about the difficulties in translating Dürer's work as there were no ancient predecessors and Dürer has, additionally, coined some new words in German that he had to render into good Latin. He thus appends a glossary of his Latin translations of Dürer’s German terms of human anatomy. In some cases, also a Greek synonym and a short explanation in Latin are given. After this, two poems by Eobanus Hessus follow, in which Dürer and his art are praised. These poems were not included in the German original even though the title seems to indicate this (H. Eobanus Hessus haec quoque Duerero faciebat).The translations of the book are quite close to the German original. The style is concise and rather technical. Dürer (and his translator Camerarius) explain the different proportions of the human body and how to draw it step by step. Many illustrations with numbers referring to sentences in the text are included. They are the same in the original and the translation. The first two books deal with proportions of the human body and introduce different drawing techniques (the methods in the second book are somewhat more intricate). 
Books 3 and 4 were, as it has already been stated, translated and published separately. They deal with changes of figures and how to draw gestures etc. This volume also contains paratexts: A letter to the reader introduces it. Moreover, there are several epitaphia for Dürer and other poems (all in elegiac couplets) praising his work at the end of the volume (four by Willibald Pirckheimer, four by Eobanus Hessus, two by Camerarius himself, one of which in Greek).

In 1714, Borgondio, one of the best-known early-eighteenth century Jesuit scholars, who taught mathematics at the Collegio Romano and among whose students was the distinguishedRuđer Josip Bošković, composed a tract in which he explicitly, in line with orthodoxy, opposed and corrected the heliocentric system. However, as evidence suggests, this was not an actual rejection of the Copernican worldview. The subsequent proliferation of texts that applied the same approach to present the new cosmological ideas, while formally rejecting them, would become typical in the mid-eighteenth century.Be that as it may, Borgondio's tract was conceived to amend the views of the ""French and English mathematicians"" in order to adjust them to the geocentric (or rather geo-heliocentric) system. The present short piece contains a series of short mathematical theses against Copernicanism taken from  Borgondio's work. Highly technical and mathematical, with little proper explanations and no graphs to illustrate the calculations, these notes, at the same time, are indicative of the teaching practices and dissemination of knowledge within the Jesuit order in the eighteenth century. In response to the studies carried out in Oxford and Paris in 1699 (what is labelled ""new observations"" throughout the text), Borgondio suggests that these calculations should be corrected, as they fail to explain how the earth's motion correlates with the position of other celestial bodies in the universe. Although for the sake of orthodoxy, Borgondio states that to the heliocentric system, he favours that of Tycho Brahe and Giovanni Battista Riccioli, his statement implicitly implies that what the ""new observations"" require is not rejectionin toto, but correction.",,"Borgondio, Orazio‎(← links)De Telluris motu(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Borgondio, Orazio:De telluris motu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_telluris_motu(last revision: 29.01.2022).",,IT,Yes,OA,

Thematically, the journal featured a high proportion of mathematical contributions. Most of them were due to Leonhard Euler, but there also were some by his friend and colleague Christian Goldbach who like Euler himself held a position at the Academy.The present contributionOn the General Formulas of Sequencesis quite typical of the articles published in the early volumes of theCommentariiwith regard to its length and structure. It comprises ten pages and is subdivided into a series of numbered paragraphs (whose numeration strangely changes from Roman to Arabic, §§ I–V being followed by §§ 6–14). In terms of content, the article deals with explicit formulas (terminus generalis) of sequences, as intimated in the title and clarified by a definition and an example in the very first sentence:Terminus generalis seriei est formula, quae per quantitatem quandam variabilem x aequalem exponenti termini quaesiti exhibet ipsum terminum quaesitum seriei, ut si terminus generalis sit x2+ x + 1 et quaeratur terminus decimus seriei, habebitur 100 + 10 + 1 = termino quaesito 111.The explicit formula of a sequence is a formula which through a certain variable quantity made equal to the index of a term sought renders the term sought of the sequence itself; for instance, if the general formula isx2+x + 1and the tenth term of the sequence is sought, one will have 100 + 10 + 1 = the term sought, 111.Goldbach then clarifies some important notions likelex progressionis(recurrence relation),lex progressionis constans(recursions with unique terms) and presents some methods how to switch between these representations of a sequence in certain situation. He presents a possibility to find an explicit formula for any given sequence by the means of so-called Newton interpolation. This yields an infinite polynomial series which breaks down to finitely many summands forx=1,2,3,...Similarly asWallisin hisArithmetica infinitorumhe asks for ""intermediate terms"" (termini medii) of sequences: if the first, the second, etc. term is given, what is the 1.5th term, for example? The explicit formula can deliver a result if one plugs in 1.5 forxbut Goldbach also presents other sophisticated solutions in a special case. The question of whether this intermediate term is in any way unique (which it is not!) is not discussed; even though a second rule for finding an explicit formula for arbitrary sequences (a kind of multiplicative Newton interpolation) takes a very different form where it is not at all clear whether the intermediate terms are equal or not. The presentation aims to show how explicit formulas can alleviate the work with sequences and therefore, Goldbach introduces a notation which he callsformulas exponentiales. They are not exponentials likeaxdenoting thex-fold multiplication ofabut inspired by the repeated multiplication he defines shorthands for repeated addition and multiplication of terms. This way of writing has nowadays become obsolete by the use of a Σ with indices (invented byEuleronly in 1755,Cajori 2011, §438) for sums or Π for products. Overall, a lack of distinction between series and sequences is noticable; often divergent series are denoted like1 + 1*2 + 1*2*3 + 1*2*3*4 &c., actually meaning the sequence of the summands.The aforementioned opening sentence also exhibits a number of formal traits which are characteristic of Goldbach's article as a whole. Prominent among these are the frequent recourse to numerical examples to elucidate general statements, the consistent use of technical expressions such asterminus,seriesorquaero, which are repeated as often as demanded by the sense without any stylistic qualms, and the deployment of modern mathematical notation, which is integrated into the natural language text grammatically (for instance, ""="" is constructed with dative like its natural language equivalentaequalis) and typographically. Finally, it is worth pointing out that Goldbach foregoes a formal introduction in which the subject would be properly presented and justified and goes straightin medias resinstead: like a modern scientist publishing in a journal, he writes for experts who are already familiar with the field and prepared to regard any addition to it as desirable in itself.",,"Goldbach, Christian‎(← links)","Goldbach, Christian:De terminis generalibus serierum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_terminis_generalibus_serierum(last revision: 15.12.2021).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

This natural disaster inspired many contemporary literary accounts, some of which were published soon after the event. Besides theatre production and poetry, several prose texts documented the earthquake and speculated about its causes. One of these was the university dissertation defended in September of the same year at the University of Altdorf in Bavaria by the student Jacob Lochner, under thepraesesJohann Christoph Sturm (for another dissertation on the same topic defended at the University of Innsbruck, cf.De terraemotibus anni 1670).The dissertation starts with the occasion of choosing this topic, the earthquake, which was felt strongly even in Bavaria, as well as in Italy, and caused severe damage in the Tyrol. The author goes on to stress his use of the new methods of scientists, empirical knowledge and experiment, which lead to certain demonstration. Accordingly, chapter two lists typical phenomena observed around earthquakes: the earth moving like the sea, horizontal or perpendicular tremors, a peculiar noise preceding or accompanying the tremors, fire, flooding, or wind accompanying the quake, aftershocks in the days, weeks, and months following the event and more. Chapter three, presenting various observations and experiments, wants to illuminate the causes for such disasters. It explains that the earth is full of cavities, holes, caverns under its surface, which are interconnected, numerous of them filled with subterraneous fires, as Athanasius Kircher explained in hisMundus subterraneus, others with subterraneous water or winds. The subterraneous fires, as well as sulphur and nitrite cause volcanic eruptions. The author goes on to argue that if the earth is full of substances, which cause eruptions, and are used to make the most potent gunpowder, then these elements, salts, minerals, gases and more could certainly be responsible for such a strong disaster as an earthquake. His conclusion, given in chapter four, is that earthquakes are caused by inflammable elements, minerals, salts, and gases in the cavities of the earth, which catching fire cause disruptions that can be felt of the surface. This also causes the noise, which is often heard during such events, and other phenomena listed earlier. The last chapter collects opinions of others, mostly contemporaries, about the same questions. 
The language and style of the dissertation are largely technical, without rhetorical flourish, the structure is clear and transparent. The work is succeeded by three short congratulatory poems.","Korenjak; Schaffenrath; Subaric; Töchterle 2012, pp. 839–840.","De terraemotibus anni 1670‎(← links)Sturm, Johann Christoph‎(← links)Lochner, Jacob Hieronymus‎(← links)","Sturm, Johann Christoph; Lochner, Jacob Hieronymus:De terrae-motibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_terrae-motibus(last revision: 03.08.2021).",,"OA, WB",Yes,JL,

The disaster had an impact on the local literary production and was reflected in histories and chronologies, dramas, poems, and philosophical (scientific) literature. The Jesuit Anton Manincor, one of the first professors at the newly founded University of Innsbruck, published hisDisputation on the Earthquakes of 1670in February of the following year. Anotherdissertationon the same topic had been defended a few months earlier at the University of Altdorf in Bavaria.The print opens with dedication letter by the respondents Anton Waid and Peter Prantner, two students of Manincor's metaphysics class. The following preface by Manincor opens with a literary topos: it is as sweet to talk about past misfortunes as it was sad to suffer them (fol. a2r). Now that the danger is over, it is possible to entertain a learned discourse about the earthquake. The main text is divided into a series of tenquaestiones. The dissertation discusses the nature, the direction, the point of origin, the causes and effects of the earthquake and gives an outlook on the current aftershocks and the danger of future earthquakes. Next, there are 18conclusioneson the soul on the basis of Aristotle'sDe anima, which provided material for the oral examination. At the end, fellow students congratulate the two respondents in a poem in Alcaic stanzas.On the one hand, the dissertation is a conventional example of its kind, as it argues along Aristotelian lines and exhibits the typical structure of the genre. On the other hand, it demonstrates the flexibility of this type of publication, which can be adapted to the discussion of contemporary and local events. Manincor's text combines the mould of the philosophical dissertation with the ""catastrophe literature"" produced in the wake of a natural disaster. In addition, the dissertation morphs into an eyewitness account at some points where Manincor relates his personal experience of the earthquake in a first-person narrative.Dissertations were a convenient publication outlet for professors, since the respondents had to pay for the print.

Largely quoting from ancient philosophers other than Aristotle, Galesio does not, in fact, criticise or replace Aristotle's notion according to which the natural phenomena originated from the motion of winds inside the earth.

The text, which, in fact, does not strictly follow the genre of a dissertation, is structured in four chapters or parts. Unlike other dissertations of the age, in Parts 1 and 2 Baglivi does not provide any substantial overview of earthquake theories briefly limiting himself to a couple of names, which, however, demonstrates his engagement with contemporary debates. Partly relying on ""what Gassendi claimes in Peiresc'svita"", but also providing additional evidence, Baglivi says that the main cause for earthquakes is the heat in the centre of the globe, and that natural disasters occur depending on its increase. At the same time, Baglivi enriches his investigation with numerous references to classical authors (such as Seneca and Pliny) and takes up several examples from classical texts in order to support his claim on the origin of earthquakes; thus, he repeatedly states that the case of Vesuvius widely described in ancient literature on which he draws his conclusions proves that the causes of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are similar. In Parts 3 and 4, Baglivi elaborates on the consequences of the Roman earthquake and collects the information about its victims and affected cities. This information is summarised in several charts of ""sociological"" clarity and thoroughness. As a professional physician, Baglivi also works through, albeit briefly, the diseases that usually emerge after earthquakes and the ways in which they need to be prevented.Baglivi'sOperawas reprinted numerous times in the first half of the eighteenth century, with some later editions containing some additional and previously unpublished material, but none of the reproductions did affect the content or other features of theDe terraemotu Romano.",,"Baglivi, Giorgio‎(← links)","Baglivi, Giorgio:De terraemotu Romano, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_terraemotu_Romano(last revision: 03.08.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

The dreadful disasters were reflected in numerous contemporary texts, often written from an eschatological perspective. Probably, the most famous description of the 1456 disaster was Giannozzo Manetti’sDe terremotu. In this treatise addressed to his patron Alfonso of Aragon, with abundant references to Latin and Greek sources, Manetti sought to reconstruct an ancient understanding of natural disasters and, thus, provide a detailed account of how to predict and prevent earthquakes in the future. Apart from that, Manetti aimed at exploring an alleged correlation between political virtues of a ruler and disasters hitting their territories. By addressing the issue of a ruler’sfortunawidely debated at the time in Italian humanist circles, Manetti combined contemporary natural philosophical debates on the origin of disasters with political ethics.TheDe terremotuconsists of three books, in which, as Manetti claims in the introduction, he aims to work through different opinions on the origin of earthquakes as well as to describe in detail the effects of the 1456 disaster. In the address to Alfonso, he states that the terrible earthquake that occurred “under your joyful and fortunate reign” and hit Campania, Apulia and other regions of the Neapolitan kingdom caused numerous deaths and destroyed several cities and fortresses. Manetti goes on to say that to find out how such paradoxical things could happen, he decided to have a look into ancient and new Latin and Greek sources. He states that in the treatise he will gradually explore the positions of poets, historians, jurists and theologians who think that such events are to be ascribed to the intervention of omnipotent God into the terrestrial world – something which, Manetti adds, contradicts the opinions of astrologers and philosophers for whom earthquakes are provoked exclusively by natural causes. Manetti does not, however, structure the first book of the treatise in accordance with the conflicting positions; instead, he presents a mixture of views, which leads him to the conclusion that for the benefit of knowledge and political prosperity in Southern Italy, these stances should be reconciled. In the second book of theDe terremotu, he goes through various catastrophes of the past, from Biblical times onwards, reported in Hebrew, Greek and Latin texts. As the selected primary material in Books 1 and 2 to some extent overlaps, the distinction between the parts advanced in the introduction and then reiterated in the opening pages of Book 2 seems artificially constructed. Book 3 lacks this inconsistency, as it focuses in particular on the damage the 1456 earthquake produced in the Neapolitan kingdom.
Written in refined and elegant Latin, theDe terremotuis a perfect example of a humanist political and natural philosophical treatise. It was recognised by Manetti's contemporaries, including Vespasiano da Bisticci, who listed it among Manetti's main writings.

It contains several texts dealing with the medical concoctions and antidotes Theriac and Mithridateion. The first text is a small treatise (commentariolus) to Johannes Magenbuch, a physician and friend of Camerarius. In it, Camerarius first adresses the difficulties of physicians in preparing drugs as they lack experience with this craft. Camerarius also speaks about his current situation, i.e. that he had to flee with his family from Nuremberg to the rural area in order not to become infected with the pest. Camerarius used his time to read about antidotes in the ancient sources and Galen in particular and presents now the fruits of hislucubrationes.The second text is a letter to Johann Schütz, also a physician, that serves as dedication to the following translation ofGalenus’Libellus ad Pamphilianum ad Theriaca. Camerarius starts with the description of his escape and the current situation and how this let him to work on ancient medical texts. He highlights also the value of the following medical poems as Apollo is the god of medicine and of poetry (Apollinem enim inventorem artis vestrae, ut Graeci perhibent, scis et poetis quasi proprium numen attribui.). Camerarius's translation of Galenus’ book on Theriac dedicated to Pamphilianus is written in good Latin, and seems – as Camerarius has indicated in the dedicatory letter – to keep the sense but does not follow the original syntax too closely.

Originally published in Italian in the first volume of Gian Battista Ramusio's collectionNavigationi e viaggi(Venice 1550), it was soon translated into various other languages. Among the first translations, and perhapsthevery first one, was the present Latin version by the Antwerpian schoolman Johannes Florianus. As it came out early in 1556, the assumption ofBlack 2002, 270, that the French translation by Jean Temporal (Lyon 1556) predated and possibly influenced it, seems unwarranted. At any rate, Florianus' Latin version was reprinted in 1559 in Zurich and served as source text for a later English translation by John Pory (London 1600;Black 2002, 265).The text is dedicated to the then treasurer of Antwerp, the wealthy merchant Melchior Schets. In his letter of dedication, the translator praises the contents of Leo's book as going far beyond Ptolemy and bolsters the author's credibility by a short biographical sketch that shows his familiarity with the black continent. (Indeed, Leo time and again expressedly reports events and circumstances as an eyewittness.) Thanks to the copiousindex rerum(26 octavo pages) that follows, the Latin version may not only be read through, but can also be used as a work of reference.In general, Leo's account intermingles physical geography (including botanical, zooogical, meteorological and other observations) and ethnography. In book 1, an overview of Africa and its population is given. Books 2–8 provide a series of more detailed chorographical descriptions of parts of northern Africa from Marocco to Egypt. Book 7, however, is devoted to the regions and cities of the Songhai Empire by the Niger; it was this book that exerted the greatest fascination on later generations. Finally, book 9 informs the reader specifically about African rivers, animals, minerals and plants. In the present Latin edition, the whole account is divided into sections of a few pages each by subtitles.Florianus' translation is pleasurable to read and generally remains faithful to the Italian.

The article may be among the earliest thorough studies of the important structure named in its title, which serves the transport of water, sugar, and other nutrients within the plant. The structure itself had been discovered half a century earlier byMarcello Malpighi, who called the vesselstracheae(literally ""the rough ones"") in imitation of the Greek name for the windpipe in humans and animals (Scott 1927, 548).The text falls into three parts: a short record of how Bilfinger became interested in the topic while studying the root of a melon (p. 182), 28 numberedphaenomenaobserved during his further systematic study of other parts of the same plant (including some simple experiments such as sucking air and liquids through the vessels, nos. 5–7) (pp. 182–185), and eleven equally numberedconclusionesdrawn from his findings (pp. 185–187). The opening part features traits typical of the scientific report (Dear 1985) such as a precise date (3 September 1729), some detail (the melon plant has three ripe fruits), the use of the first person singular, and a personal viewpoint, as Bilfinger speaks of hiscupiditas(""desire"") to investigate the plant's inner structure. By contrast, the two main parts state observations and ponder conclusions in a fairly impersonal manner. Their fine-grained subdivision into sections comprising only one or two sentences on average is noteworthy. Bilfinger presumably atomizes his insights in this way for the sake of clarity and to make it possible to discuss and reference every single observation or conclusion on its own, if need be. Likewise, the strict separation of observations and conclusions gives the reader the freedom to reject some of the latter while still using the former to his own ends, an advantage of the report format already noted by Robert Boyle (Dear 1985, 157). The single propositions are formulated in a clear, unassuming Latin, which contains only a handful of technical terms.

This results in a 12 page index of cited authors, which, together withindex rerumand a table of contents, make the encyclopedia easily navigable.

In a wordplay on the subject of his book, Bartholin says that he is only able to reflect Finck’s light in sickle shape (cornu meo). In a similar manner, he plays on his topic, the horns in the letter on the readers, too, telling them that they must wonder why Bartholin is showing (inoffensive) horns (cornua ostendo).

And, if the unicorn horns turned out to be narwhal tusks, does it follow that there were no unicorns at all? Although Bartholin demasked the narwhal tusks, he did not deny them miraculous medical powers, and did not conclude that unicorns did not exist.Bartholin's observations on the unicorn can be encountered in disputations and medical handbooks from 1660 onwards (cf. Roling 2014).

The language and style of the didactic poem are of high humanist standard, with numerous and often hidden references to classical texts, while the prose demonstrates Biese's profound knowledge of contemporary natural philosophical debates and presents an abundance of additional evidence, which, in his opinion, was supposed to elucidate the often unclear meaning of verses (e.g. Greek philosophical vocabulary and his own translations of most complex terms, diagrams etc).

"Maitland, John",De Uraniburgo in insula Tycho<nis> Brahae,"Deliciae poetarum Scotorum huius aevi illustrium, vol. 2, p. 139",1637,Amsterdam,Blaeu,17th century,Panegyric poem,Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,De Uraniburgo in insula Tychonis Brahae(Google Books),898565,"John Maitland, first Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, was not only lord chancellor of Scotland, but also a Neo-Latin poet. In his own time, he was known in particular for his satirical epigrams on political opponents, but he never edited a collection of his poems. Almost all of his surviving verse can be found in theDeliciae poetarum Scotorum(vol. 2, pp. 138–143), an anthology of Scottish Neo-Latin poetry that appeared in 1637, 42 years after Maitland's death.It is doubtful whether the selection is representative of Maitland's poetic output, or whether, or how much, Maitland's poems were altered by the editorArthur Johnston. Within the selection, however, there are a number of epigrams that were inspired by Maitland's stay in Denmark in the entourage of King James of Scotland during winter and spring 1589/90. In March 1590, Maitland went with the king to visit Tycho Brahe in his observatory Uraniborg on Hven Island. This visit is reflected in Maitland's poems: seven of his epigrams in theDeliciae poetarum Scotorumare devoted to the Danish astronomer: a string of three epigrams on Uraniborg (p. 139) and four more epigrams on Tycho's portrait, on Urania and Tycho himself (p. 142).The title of the three epigramsOn Uraniborg on the Island of Tycho Brahecontains a printing error, since the nameTychoshould be declinedTychonisin the genitive. The first two epigrams praise Uraniborg as a palace of the Muses, an ornament of the world and a rival of Olympus that houses all the wisdom and wonder of ancient Babylon, Greece and Egypt. The third epigram is the longest of the three. It portrays Tycho's setting-up of Uraniborg as a heroic deed that is more amazing than the fates of Hercules and Ganymede:Si mirum Alciden caelum subiisse ferendo,aut puerum raptu detinuisse deos,Uraniam in terras celso qui eduxit Olympo,quantus et Uraniois annumerandus erit!""If it is miraculous that Hercules supported the sky by carrying it or that the gods kidnapped a boy and kept him with them, how great will be he who brought Urania down to earth from high Olympus, a man that will have to be counted among the Uranians!""The epigram displays humanist learning by alluding to the myths of Hercules and Ganymede, including Greek forms (Alciden, Uraniois) and playing on the word οὐράνιος (uránios, „heavenly“). As Tycho does not move towards the heavens, but gives Urania a home on earth, he is portrayed as a Prometheus, or Socrates, of astronomy. The wordplay establishes a connection between Urania and Tycho, who is counted among the οὐράνιοι (uránioi). This might simply indicate a kinship between the muse and the astronomer, but since οὐράνιοι is often used to refer to the gods, it might also point to Tycho's future apotheosis.Maitland's epigrams on Tycho constitute the interesting example of a personal encounter with a scientist reflected in panegyric poetry. Even more interesting, perhaps, is the decision of the editor of theDeliciae poetarum Scotorumto include no less than seven Tycho poems in the anthology. Together, they make up one fifth of the entire Maitland section. This shows that by 1637, due to fame of their addressee, the Tycho epigrams were expected to meet the interest of the intended readership.","Sutton 2011(online edition with introduction, text, translation, commentary)",,"Maitland, John:De Uraniburgo in insula Tychonis Brahae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_Uraniburgo_in_insula_Tychonis_Brahae(last revision: 21.01.2022).","Sutton quotes a letter from Tycho Brahe to Peter Young, a member of the Scottish court (1593), in which he writes about Maitland's poetry:Idem petii a magnifico d. cancellario Iohanne Metellano, cuius in poesi argutum ingenium vel paucula illa carmina ostendunt, quae ianuae conclavis vestri regis, cum hic una addesset, utut inter circumbibendum et colloquendum, obiter quidem, sed non sine nervoso acumine, discedensque mnemosyni loco scripsit, quae etiamnum illic spectantur.(cf.

De urinis",1535,Venice,"Giovanni Padovano, Venturino Ruffinelli",16th century,"Monograph, Translation",Medicine,De urinis(Google Books),704347,"Alongside Galen's genuine works, of vast amount of texts was wrongly transmitted under his name in early modern times. In many cases, these were difficult to distinguish from the real stuff, and even if a work was suspect, a printer often found it more convenient to sell it under the name of the great medical authority. Such is the case of the first Latin translation ofDe uriniswritten by the Polish physician Józef Struś, dedicated to his teacher Valentinus Morawskii and published together with another spurious prognostic work, theAstrology to Aphrodisius, in 1535 in Venice. Although this short treatise on uroscopy is certainly inauthentic and this was more or less openly acknowledged in later 16th century editions, no hint of this is given in the present edition. Apparently, the combination of Galen's name on one hand and uroscopy, a diagnostic method of cardinal importance, on the other was meant to guarantee that the book would find many buyers.De urinis, which comprises only 13 pages after the letter of dedication, begins with a classification of the different kinds of urine according to their clarity/murkiness and colour. First, these categories are reviewed separately, then, their combinations are discussed. After the fluid itself, the texture, colour and position (on the surface, in the middle, at the bottom) of the particles contained therein are dealt with. All these aspects are interpreted according to categories such as the oppositions full vs. empty, cooked vs. raw (i.e. digested vs. indigested) and the excretion of harmful matter. In this way, the diagnostic and prognostic information contained in the urine is disclosed. The reasoning may be illustrated by the meaning of white urine in the case of burning fever. This is a lethal sign, because the white colour indicates that the bile causing the fever does not leave the body with the urine, but infests the head instead (fol. Ciiv–Ciiir). The treatise ends with a discussion of good and bad types of urine which partly overlaps with what has been said before.The Latin is syntactically simple and lexically unclassical; ""murky"", for example, is expressed asgrossus. In some cases, Greek terms are kept and a Latin explanation is added; for instance, a bran-like deposit is calledhypostasis pityroides,id est, quae habet quiddam simile furfuri(fourth last page, unnumbered). The descriptions of the different types of urine are graphic and precise and constitute a 'school of seeing' for the doctor. The author's desire to give clear, precise rules is further underlined by the closed nature of the single sections, which often begin with a kind of title (e.g.De tenui et alba urina) and are rounded off by a phrase likeHaec igitur significat tenuis et alba urina(fol. Ciiv–Ciiir).Standards of production are low. The print seems to be meant as a cheap vade mecum for quick consultation at the bedside, perhaps also as a handbook for students. Struś's translation was reprinted several times until 1553.","Durling 1961, esp. 259, 265, 292","Struś, Józef‎(← links)Galeni De urinis liber(redirect page) ‎(← links)Ps.-Galenus‎(← links)","Ps.-Galenus; Struś, Józef:De urinis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_urinis(last revision: 20.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In 1791, they were published in a Latin paper in the proceedings of the Institute of Arts and Sciences in Bologna. At the same time, an offprint of the paper was produced, which Galvani sent as a gift to fellow scientists, as the noteex dono auctoris(as a gift from the author) on the flyleaf of our digital copy shows. In 1792, only one year after the initial publication, Galvani’s report came out as a book, together with adissertatioand notes by his nephew Giovanni Aldini. Galvani’s report met with great interest among the reading public and sparked a scientific discussion about animal electricity.The title presents Galvani's paper as part of the genrecommentarius, the collection of material or the autobiographical report. In the same line, the preface announces ""brief and accurate account of the discovered things"" (brevem et accuratam inventorum historiam, p. 363) on which future research can build. The report of the experiments is presented in three parts, on artifical electricity (p. 363–74), atmospherical electricity (p. 374–7) and animal electricity (p. 377–94). The fourth and last part of the paper contains a number of corrollaries, conjectures and hypotheses on the conducted experiments (p. 394–415). The report is accompanied by four fold-out tables illustrating the various experiments.The experiments are related in a vivid and detailed first-person narrative. A good example is the account of the first time that Galvani observed the twitching legs of the frog by chance (p. 364). In fact, it is one of his anonymous assistants that notices the unusual phenomenon first, while Galvani is working on something else:Rei novitatem ille admiratus de eadem statim me alia omnino molientem ac mecum ipso cogitantem admonuit.

On the spot, I was aflame with incredible eagerness and desire to experience the same and to uncover what was hidden there. Therefore, I myself moved the point of the scalpel towards the one or the other crural nerve at the moment when someone of the people present produced a spark. The phenomenon happened in exactly the same way:  violent contractions were induced in the single muscles of the limbs at the very moment when the sparks were produced, as if the dissected animal was seized by tetanus.Within the narrative, the reader encounters numerous technical terms likenervus,scalpellum,conductor,insulare,idioelectricusandanelectricus, testifying to the highly formalised language in this late phase of Neo-Latin scientific literature.","von Oettingen 1894a(German translation),Foley; Cohen 1953(English translation)Pera 1992;Piccolino; Bresadola 2013Epstein; Spivak 2019","Galvani, Luigi‎(← links)","Galvani, Luigi:De viribus electricitatis in motu musculari commentarius, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_viribus_electricitatis_in_motu_musculari_commentarius(last revision: 18.10.2021).","Another nice example of vivid narrative is when Galvani and his friend Rialpus hold hands and form an ""electric chain"".",MK,Yes,IT,

Section I. treats light and its perception in general, followed by section II. on the act of seeing and its physiological foundations. In section III., questions relating to the size, brightness and distance of the object of vision are discussed. Section IV., on the sensitivity of the retina, is the longest and most detailed one; it is divided into a number of subsections and inter alia speaks about optical illusions. In section V., the author attempts to distinguish physical and psychological aspects of vision. Section VI. is dedicated to double images: Why do we normally perceive only one image with our two eyes, and under which conditions may double images arise?In formal terms, this dissertation is a typical example of the 'degeneration' of the aphoristic form (which goes back to Hippocrates'Aphorisms) in later scientific writing (for an example from botany, see Carl Agardh'sAphorismi botanici). Tiemann's so-called aphorisms comprise one to two pages on average, have nothing aphoristic about them in terms of style and are simply a convenient means to organise his dissertation in a number of subsections.

While the first part was composed by Ficino in the early 1480s, according to himself, after he had read medical writings of thirteenth-century scholar Arnaldus de Villa Nova, the two other parts reflected his interest in Neoplatonic philosophy. As is well known, apart from providing the first ever translation of the Platonic corpus into Latin, Ficino was also responsible for the first Latin translation of Plotinus'Enneadson which he worked in the 1480s. Although the whole translation was ready by 1486, during the next six years, he continued to polish the final text until it was finally published in 1492. In 1489, he decided to extract one part of his enormous commentary on Plotinus and make it a separate treatise, which is now available as Part 3 of theDe vita,De vita coelitus comparanda. Along with this portion of the text initially seen by Ficino as a commentary on Chapter 11 of Book 3 of the Fourth Ennead, he composed the second part entitledDe vita longa. The tripartite treatise was ready by August 1489, that is three years before the publication of Plotinus.The features consequently determine the content of the treatise: while Parts 1 and 2 mostly rely on medieval medical concepts and practices, Part 3 presents a mixture of medieval astro-medicine (especially in what is related to talismanic magic) and Neoplatonic philosophical trends. The most significant novelty Ficino had introduced is, without a doubt, the concept ofspiritus, which is responsible for the emanation oflogoi spermatikoiand thus operates in the terrestrial world.

It is therefore fitting that the monumental six tomes of hisOpera omnia, published a few years after his death on the initiative of Henri Louis Habert de Montmor, are in turn introduced by a biography of some 30 folio pages composed by Gassendi's younger friend Samuel Sorbière. The title of this work is modelled on Gassendi's ownDe vita et moribus Epicuri(""Life and Manners of Epicurus"", 1647).After an apology for having taken the task upon himself despite his lack of ability, Sorbière first informs the reader about Gassendi's family background, his upbringing and how he was drawn into scholarship and science by his innate talent and several patrons. The only further events of Gassendi's life which are narrated in some detail are a journey to the Netherlands, where he made many friends, and his last illness and death (precipitated, it seems, by exaggerated bloodletting). The universal mourning at this occasion leads over to a loving description of Gassendi's virtues, the greatest of which were piety, frugality and extreme modesty in spite of his impressive acumen. Although some people criticised his lack of expertise in higher mathematics, he became a brillant and versatile scientist without such subleties. Towards its end the biography features an impressive list of first-class intellectuals with whom Gassendi was on friendly terms. The final paragraphs praises the present edition, which will make Gassendi's thinking available to everyone. The biography proper is followed by a copper engraving depicting Gassendi's epithaph, in which his scientific achievements are however only mentioned in passing (for a very different epitaph of a scientist, see theEpitaphium in Newtonum).The panegyrical tendency of the work makes itself felt from its very first sentence, which begins with the wordsQualis quantusque vir fuerit Petrus Gessendus ὁ μακαρίτης …(""What kind of and how great a man the blessed Gassendi was …""). In line with this purpose, the text is written in carefully stylised periods. When Sorbière starts to enumerate Gassendi's scientific activities and achievements, for instance, he does so in the form ofcorrectio, an emphatic self-correction, styled as a tricolon (fol. i r):Sed quid ego natum dico ad abstrusissima quaeque disciplinarum virum doctissimum, qui reipsa penetraverat in adita, recessus omnes lustraverat, nullum non moverat lapidem, ut veritatem erueret?(""But why do I call the most learned man only naturally gifted for the most difficult tasks in all disciplines, when he in fact entered all secret places, searched all recesses and left no stone unturned to bring to light the truth?"") Such stylistic loftiness is however mitigated by a number of vivid anecdotes and some humour here and there, as when the parents of the four-year-old Gassendi, who has left the house at night to gaze at the stars, have to get up to bring home the ""astronomer in the cradle"" (puerum in cunis astrologizantem, fol. a v). In order to highlight Gassendi's fame and his impressive network, Sorbière indulges in a great deal of namedropping, which is evident at first sight because proper names are always printed in small caps.",,"Sorbière, Samuel‎(← links)Vita Gerardi Mercatoris‎(← links)","Sorbière, Samuel:De vita et moribus Petri Gassendi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_vita_et_moribus_Petri_Gassendi(last revision: 02.09.2021).",fol. a 4r writes lives of Copernicus and Tycho,MK,Yes,MK,

In the print, it is introduced by a portrait of Brahe and a few lines that look like a dedication to Rudolf II at first sight; in fact, however, they are just a request of Brahe's heirs for (presumably financial) help. The speech is followed by four poems: an epitaph, a chronogram (one elegiac couplet each) and two elegies of seven and one and a half pages respectively by Johannes Kepler and a certain Paullus Ianus Colding (perhaps the Danish church historian and lexicographer Povel Jensøn Colding).The speech proper comprises 13 quarto pages. In front of Brahe's body lying in repose ((p. [2],ante oculos vestros videtis depositum), Jessen starts from the universal mourning caused by the demise of the great astronomer, emphasizes his personal loss and grief and announces that his oration will be simple and unadorned (actually, it consists of carefully styled periods and rises to high pathos in theexordiumand towards the end). The main part is dedicated to a narrative of Tycho's life. Jessen describes Brahe's homeland and noble birth and proceeds to recount his education and love for astronomy, the installation of his observatory on the island of Hven, the invention of the Tychonian world system, Brahe's emigration from Denmark (on whose causes Jessen is silent) and the hospitality enjoyed at the court of Rudolf II in Prague. At this point, a defence of Brahe against unjust criticism, a list of important admirers and a sketch of his looks and character are inserted, before the story of his death is told. The urinary retention which seems to have played a decisive role therein is described in considerable detail,ne veritati forsan vis fiat commento alienissimo(p. [12], ""so that truth may not be harmed by a most inappropriate fiction""); apparently, more sinister rumours were circulating, perhaps comparable to modern speculations that Brahe had been poisoned. The oration ends with lavish praise of Tycho, thatsingulare Naturae beneficium et litteraturae ornamentum(""unique blessing of Nature and jewel of learning"") plus some words on the happiness he now enjoys in heaven.Jessen's funeral oration testifies to celebrity status Brahe enjoyed towards the end of his life. The public interest in him is underlined by the fact that another edition of theOratio funebriswas published still in the same year in Hamburg. Later, the speech was reprinted, inter alia, in 1654 byGassendias a companion piece to hisTychonis Brahei vita. Today, it is still quoted by biographers of Brahe, although perhaps not always read as carefully as desirable. For instance, modern biographies usually state that Brahe's vesical problems started at a banquet of Rudolf II, while Jessen (p. [12]) only writes of aillustrissimi viri cena(""dinner given by a member of the high nobility""). A translation, which apparently does not exist at the moment, would probably prove helpful in this respect.",,"Jessen, Johann von‎(← links)Elogium Rudolphi Augustini Vogel‎(← links)","Jessen, Johann von:De vita et morte Tychonis Brahei oratio funebris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_vita_et_morte_Tychonis_Brahei_oratio_funebris(last revision: 17.06.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

If this is the case, the book in question is usually anOpera omniaedition or at least a collection of various works. That is also true of the three tomes of Newton'sOpusculaedited by Johann Castillon, whose first tome is opened by aShort Account of Isaac Newton's Life.On 13 quarto pages, Castillon gives a chronological overview of Newton's life, achievements and honours, starting from his family and birth (p. XXI) and ending with his death and funeral. However, he frequently interrupts his narrative to list books read by Newton (p. XXII), enumerate editions of his works (pp. XXIII, XXV), reconstruct Newton's train of thought (pp. XXIV–XXV), discuss thePrincipia(pp. XXV–XXVI) and theOpticks(p. XXVII), summarise Newton's thinking on ancient chronology (p. XXVIII–XXIX) and quote two epithaphs on him (the first of whichis from his monument in Westminster Abbey, whilethe secondhas been composed byAlexander Pope; pp. XXIX–XXXI). The last pages (pp. XXXI–XXXIII) are devoted to Newton's character, manners and intellectual profile.Twenty years after Newton's death, much had already been written about this hero of modern science, so Castillon had many sources at his disposal, which he diligently adduces in footnotes. His style is in general easy to follow. The tone is panegyrical, and the less endearing aspects of Newton's personality are carefully edited out. The alternation of narrative and digressions avoids the danger of monotony, and Castillon shows a certain sense for graphic detail. The famous apple in Newton's garden surprisingly becomes a pear (p. XXIV,gravitatis vim – aliqui dicunt a piro cadente admonitus – considerare coepit), and one learns that due to his thick grey hair, Newton looked better without than with his wig (p. XXXI,Vultu fuit iucundo simul et venerando, praesertim cum fictitia coma ablata verum detegeret canam densamque). However, Castillon does not get lost in anecdotes, but aspires to portray Newton as a scientist whose thinking covers mathematics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, chronology, theology and more. The way he enters Newton's head, so to speak, at pp. XXIV–XXV in order to let the reader participate in his first tentative reflections on gravity is remarkable. Tellingly, the biography does not end with a certainevent, but with athought, namely a bold speculation on the nature of matter and how it came into being. Matter, Newton thought, might be nothing else but impenetrable space, created by God as a counterpart to empty space (p. XXXIII):Aliquo pacto, aiebat, intelligere liceret, quo pacto materies creata fuerit, si supponeretur Deum sua potentia vetuisse, ne quid penetrare posset in certam spatii partem, quod purum spatium natura est penetrabile, aeternum, necessarium, infinitum. Sic enim illa spatii pars impenetrabilitate gauderet, quae qualitas de materiei essentia est.

Written as late as 1844, it is an excellent example of the longevity of Latin scientific publication in the university context. The 30 pages of the dissertation are subdivided by headings and subheadings in different fonts, dealing with propagation, germination, organology, secretions, nutrition and reproduction, and fructification of plants respectively.From a literary perspective, the introduction deserves special attention: With considerable rhetorical skill, Semmelweis prefaces his dissertation by praising the beauty, diversity and (medical and inspirational) abilities of the realm of plants. In them, the same force of nature, life, is revealed that is responsible for the formation of minerals, the tides, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the movement of celestial bodies and the existence of humans, endowed with countless and splendid gifts.The text itself is clearly structured, not only in terms of typography, but also in terms of expression, for example marking a new topic both by printing it in italics and by positioning it as the first word of the sentence. The language is technical, but elegantly phrased and rhetorically adorned, cf. e.g. the rhetorical figures in theekphrasisof the plants’ behaviour towards light (evigilante sole evigilat plantarum regnum in novam quasi vitam, aperiuntur flores, folia elevantur, vires eriguntur, quae post eius occasum relabuntur …, p. 5) or the final, carefully varied depiction of the different journeys of seeds which forms a climax from inanimate forces to animals to humans, culminating in a rhetorical exclamation (Semina leviora venti subinde per notabile spatium ferunt, graviora aqua per longum iter vehit, alia volatilia coeli dissipant, mammalia diducunt, verbi gratia mures; quae tandem homo hac in re faciat, quis non noscit!, p. 30).It is unclear if the dissertation was to be successfully defended by the candidate in adisputatio, as was customary in earlier times. Perhaps, this was not the case, and Semmelweis hat to defend the ten theses annexed to his dissertation instead, whose disputation is announced on the title page.",,"Semmelweis, Ignaz Philipp‎(← links)","Semmelweis, Ignaz Philipp:De vita plantarum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/De_vita_plantarum(last revision: 03.08.2021).","WikiSourceSonja Schreiner gave a talk about this text at the Albacete conference.p. 3: Although the last cause (god?) can never be penetrated, the human mind will not rest until it has given a sufficient explanation for all phenomena (mens humana tamen non acquiescit, donec phaenomenorum omnium rationem reddat sufficientem).","WB, DB, MK",Yes,IT,

His interests in this field resulted in two monographs onGirolamo Fracastoroand Angelo Poliziano respectively.Live, Character, Writings and Merits of Fracastorois presented as a gift to the author's friend Johann Ernst Hebenstreit on occasion of the latter's graduation in medicine in a long, affectionate letter (pp. 1–13). In this dedication, Mencke explains that he wanted to make Hebenstreit a literary present, but was afraid of coming across as a flatterer if he would have openly praised Hebenstreit's many virtues. He therefore disguised his praise as a biography of a famous personality whose virtues and expertise are mirrored in his friend's person. In addition, Mencke's work also makes sense because there is no decent biography of Fracastoro so far, the one prefixed to his 1584Opera omniabeing too short and insufficient.Comprising over 200 quarto pages, this is a unusually long biography. It also is decidedly panegyrical, as is already announced in the full title, where Fracastoro's achievements in medicine and astronomy as well as in philosophy and poetry are said to be ""simply unique"" (prorsus singularibus). The work itself is divided into ten chapters, as set out in a table of contents (p. 14). The first three of these are devoted to Fracastoro's Veronese origins and childhood (§ I), his talents and academic education (§ II), and his years as a follower of the condottiere Bartolomeo d'Alviano (§ III). After that, Mencke turns to his hero's activity as a practising physician in Verona (§ IV) and describes his philosophical, astronomical, cosmological and poetical studies (§ V). Fracastoro's achievements are shown to have won him many friends and honours (§ VI). His outer appearance and his virtues are delineated (§ VII). After a narrative of his death and the reactions elicited by it (§ VIII), the biography is finished with a kind of biographical appendix. Fracastoro's writings(§ IX) and their various editions are enumerated (§ X). Biographical and bibliographical aspects are thus intimately connected in Meincke's book, as often in early modern works on intellectuals. In general, the structure ofLive, Character, Writings and Merits of Fracastoromay be described as a freely varying the combination of chronologically evolving narrative and descriptive sections that can be found in the biographies of Suetonius. At the very end, one finds an epigram on Fracastoro by Caspar Cunradi (1571–1633) and a self-correction of a minor point in the argument.The scrupulosity evidenced by this last addendum points to another salient aspect of Mencke's book, its very learned nature. Of the 20 or so pages of each chapter, only two are on average reserved for the account of Fracastoro's life itself. The rest is occupied by a long string of notes in minor font, keyed to the text by the letters of the alphabet. These notes not only serve to document Mencke's sources and to reveal the reasons behind his reconstruction of Fracastoro's life as presented in the body text (e.g. p. 23 on his date of birth). In many cases, they also display additional information and even divert from the subject proper, growing into long excursuses (e.g. pp. 28–29, on the worth of Julius Caesar Scaliger's poetry).The book was immediately reviewed on pp. 198–200 of the 1731 volume of theActa eruditorum– unsurprisingly, since this journal was edited by the author's father Johann Burckhardt Mencke at the time. To the present day, Mencke's seems to have remained the most exhaustive biography of Fracastoro. TheDizionario Biografico degli Italianistill counts it among the works which are ""ancora indispensabili, anche se da accogliere con non poche riserve"" (DBIs.v.

A prominent representative of this tendency was Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. Already in his dissertationDe generis humani varietate nativa, he tried to define Linnaeus' division of Homo into a number of subspecies more precisely (see in generalRupke; Lauer 2019). Over the next half-century, he systematically collected human skulls, which he thought to be the most imformative part of the human body in this respect, in order to establish a stronger empirical basis for his classification (Böker 2019). In this endeavour, he was helped by numerous friends and colleagues who sent him skulls from the most remote regions of the world. The collection is still extant (Schulz; Reich 2013). Between 1791 and 1820, Blumenfeld published part of it in a series of six articles, each of which presented and discussed ten skulls, in theCommentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis. The present entry is dedicated to the first instalment of this series.By way of introduction (pp. 3–12), Blumenbach first tells the history of his craniological interests and his collection. He then establishes strict criteria a skull must meet to be recognised as genuine and typical of a given population; for instance, its provenance must be beyond doubt, it should not be disfigured by any diseases and exhibit no idiosyncratic features. Next, different possibilities of a typology of skulls are discussed. Whereas earlier attempts focussed on one characteristic only, Blumenbach tries to base his typology on a greater number; in doing so, however, he highlights the form of the forehead and the maxilla as the most important. Five fundamental types of skulls are distinguished which correspond to as many subspecies (classes): European, East Asian / North American, African, South American, and Pacific. Blumenbach is fully aware that the transitions between these types are fluent and that they cannot set clearly apart from one another (p. 11:… quae quidem omnes gradatim et inobservabili transitu inter se confluunt ita, ut non nisi arbitrariis limitibus definiri possunt …). Moreover, he shows no tendency to elevate oneclassisover the other. While he is not afraid of aesthetic judgements (see below), he clearly recognises their subjective nature. When he describes his five subspecies, for instance, he states that those of Europeans and western Asians are ""of that facial structure which we Europeans believe to be more beatiful [than others]"" (p. 11,ea faciei forma quam nos Europaei pulchriorem arbitramur).Of the ten skulls presented in the first article, four are assigned to the firstclassis, one to the second, three to the third and two to the fourth. Each item is discussed on two pages on average and depicted in a copper engraving. The method of presentation, set out on pp. 11–12, is fairly uniform. First, Blumenbach explains how and from whom he has acquired the respective skull. Next, its primary characteristics – those essential in ascertaining to whichclassisit belongs – are presented, followed by other properties, which are noteworthy as well but whose classificatory value is less certain. Finally, the skull is compared to pictorial representations and literary descriptions of the respective people.While the first and last parts of a description are in full sentences, the second and third one are in a keyword style that seems to have been adapted from description schemes customary in other branches of natural history, especially in botany. The primary characteristics of the skull of a Turk, for instance, are delineated as follows (p. 14):Calvaria fere globosa, occipitio scilicet vix ullo, cum foramen magnum paene ad extremum baseos cranii positum sit. Frons latior. Glabella prominens. Fossae malares leviter depressae. In universum faciei symmetrica et elegans proportio.Skull fairly round, hardly any back of the head, since the foramen magnum is situated nearly on the [rear] edge of the base of the skull. Quite broad forehead. Glabella protruding. Cheek fossae slightly depressed. Face in general symmetrical and well-proportioned.This terse, sober, and precise style of description, together with the mode of presentation which includes a fair number of footnotes, perfectly corresponds to the abovementioned tendency to see man, or at least his bodily side, as an ordinary part of the physical world and to work out ahumani generis naturalem historiam(""natural history of humankind"", p. 4).",,"Blumenbach, Johann Friedrich‎(← links)De generis humani varietate nativa‎(← links)","Blumenbach, Johann Friedrich:Decas collectionis suae craniorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Decas_collectionis_suae_craniorum(last revision: 23.12.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

"Regiomontanus, Johannes",Defensio Theonis contra Trapezuntium,,,,,15th century since invention of printing,"Monograph, Encyclopedic work","Mathematics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography","Defensio Theonis(regio.dartmoth.edu, contains both the facsimile of MS St Petersburg IV-1-935 and its transcript)",not available,"TheDefense of Theon against Georgius Trapezuntiusis one of the most ambitious Renaissance astronomical treatises. Due to its author's sudden death, it remained unfinished. Since the author had no chance to polish the final version, it contains numerous notes, deleted passages and preparatory remarks. Regiomontanus had been working on theDefensiofor the last 20 years of his life and apparently considered it to be the peak of his astronomical studies. The treatise was never published and preserved only in manuscript form, while its complete copy is now kept at the Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg.TheDefensio Theoniswas supposed to be Regiomontanus' response toGeorgius Trapezuntius'scommentaryon Ptolemy's Almagest. In 1451, Georgius completed his translation of the Almagest and accompanied it with a commentary of enormous length. In his work, Georgius sought to purify Ptolemy’s original ideas from subsequent interpretations, as well as to oppose Bessarion, who advised him to use Theon of Alexandria’s commentary on the Almagest, as an example. This caused one of the biggest astronomical debates of the era and a response from one of Bessarion's followers, Regiomontanus.The response in form of the thirteen books of theDefensio Theonis(reflecting theAlmagest's structure) is not only a harsh polemic on Georgius's (mis-)interpretations, errors and – according to Regiomontanus – lack of intelligence, but also offers deep insights in Regiomontanus's natural philosophic convictions. It therefore represents a less formal counterpart of hisEpitomewhere the focus was a concise and polished presentation of Ptolemy's astronomical models. InDefensio TheonisRegiomontanus struggles with the physical implication of the Ptolemaic theory of epicycles and eccenters which on the one hand contrasts observable phenomena: Already medieval scholars like Heinrich von Langenstein had remarked that the appearance of the moon must vary in size by the factor four if the Ptolemaic model for the lunar position is considered physical reality which most obviously contradicts even every-day experience. On the other hand, Regiomontanus is concerned with the challenges to bring in accordance Ptolemaic astronomy and the leading natural philosophic geocentric world-view. The latter sees Earth surrounded by physical, spherical, orbs carrying sun, moon and planets. In attempt to calculate the thickness of these orbs, he notices necessary overlaps which yield various physical questions and problems. 
As has been also pointed out byShank 2002, p. 190, Regiomontanus agenda was, to establish a homocentric astronomy (i.e., without epicycles and eccenters) – rather driven by philosophical considerations than by mathematical or astronomical ones.For long, the manuscript ofDefensio Theonishad been out of reach for the research on Regiomontanus, and, as it had not been printed, most probably also for contemporary astronomers and natural philosophers.

In theDialogue on All Aspects of the Nature of the Sea, the otherwise unknown Augustinian friar Ambrosio Florentino tries to solve this riddle by giving a full account of the sea, something ""which some students are burning with desire to know"", as claimed on the title page.The printer dedicates the work to an equally unknown personality called Ippolito Aldobrandini (not to be confounded with either of his more famous namesakes), presumably the abbot of the author's monastery. The respective epistle is followed by a letter to the reader composed by Florido himself. In it, he highlights the best minds' desire for truth, which drove Homer and Aristotle to suicide. Aristotle's doom was his inability to explain the strong currents in the Euripus Strait, which leads over to the problem of the movement of the sea in general. The last introductory paratext is a table of contents. At the end, one finds the author's declaration of subjection to the judgement of the Church, a list of printing errors (very incomplete, as the book is teeming with typos) and the imprimaturs.The dialogue itself, which comprises 40 quarto pages, is dramatic, that is, it lacks a narrative frame, following the model of Plato's rather than of Cicero's dialogues. The conversation develops between two speakers with the telling namesPhilonauticus(""Lover of Seafaring"") andPhilosophus(""Lover of Wisdom, Philosopher""). The place seems to be Padua. No precise setting is sketched, but Philonauticus starts from remembering a conversation about the tides that took place the other evening during a walk on the city walls of Padua (p. 1). There is no real discussion, let alone dissense between the two interlocutors, since they markedly differ in their knowledge and understanding: Philonauticus asks short questions, Philosophus answers and explains in considerable detail. It thus makes sense that the work is alternatively titled atractatus(""treatise"") at p. 1 and in the page headers.The dialogue is divided into twelve chapters, which are arranged in a neatly symmetrical way. Chapters 1–3 serve as an introduction: they discuss the nature of the sea in general. The six core chapters 4–9 are dedicated to the movement of the sea properly speaking. In the last three chapters, Florido returns to general reflections about the sea and the element of water. Regarding the main question, it is stated in chapter 6 that thevera et germana ratio(""true and real cause"", p. 18) of the tides are the sun and the moon. This answer is further explained and modified in a number of passages later on: For instance, the planets are said to play a certain role as well (ch. 8, p. 25), and the flow should be understood as a kind of seething of the sea under the influence of the moon (ch. 12, p. 37). While Florido's answer sounds familiar to the modern reader, he arrives at it within the traditional framework of Aristotelian physics, astronomy and meteorology which holds that the world is composed of four elements and that the heavenly bodies influence the sublunar world by their radiations.However, Florido's worldview and thought style cannot be qualified as exclusively Aristotelian and scholastic. True, he likes answering questions by referral to authorities, either specific authors or groups such as the astronomers. Phrases likeAstronomi dicunt, quod …(""The astronomers say, that … "", p. 2) are ubiquitous. Vocabulary and syntax often show a scholastic flavour as well.Quodis used instead of an accusativus cum infinitivo,quo adfor ""regarding"" (p. 4), and the author is unafraid of expressions such ascausa per se(""cause as such""),[causa] per accidens(""accidental cause""),subtiliari(""be rarified"") andsubtiliatio(""rarification""; all at the beginning of p. 17). At the same time, however, Florido is in touch with the realities of his time and not adverse to empiry. Apart from his topical question in itself, this is shown on the frequent occasions when he refers to the knowledge ofperiti nautae(""experienced sailors"", p. 33). Chapter 8 (pp. 23–26) is even dedictated to the specific vernacular terminology which Venetian sailors have developed for different varieties of ebb and flow.","Omodeo 2017, 107","Numerorum Mysteria‎(← links)Florido, Ambrosio‎(← links)","Florido, Ambrosio:Dialogismus de natura universa maris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dialogismus_de_natura_universa_maris(last revision: 10.06.2021).",,"OA, DB, MK",Yes,MK,

Epitaphium auctoris ad finem libelli adiecimus.",,1544,Cologne,"Gymnich, Johann",16th century,"Dictionary/Lexicon, Dialogue, Bibliography",Biology,Dialogus de avibus et earum nominibus(Google Books),660342,"Shortly before his death, the humanist and physician Gilbert de Longueil from Utrecht, professor of Greek at Cologne, had begun aDialogue on Birds and Their Names. The work remained unfinished. It was published the year after its author's demise by his colleague and friendWilliam Turner– a distinguished naturalist, who was to release a bird book of his own, theAvium, quarum apud Plinium et Aristotelem mentio est, historia, in the same year 1544 with the same printer. Turner dedicates his edition to Hermann von Holten, the abbot of the monastery of Werden (fols. A2r–[7r]). In the letter of dedication, he attacks unlearned intellectuals in general and goes on to lament the widespread lack of knowledge in natural history despite its importance for grammarians, philosophers, doctors and politicians. Whereas other branches of natural history can at least be learned from books, there is almost nothing for birds. Therefore, Longueil's dialogue on the subject must be highly welcome despite its unfinished state.The speakers of the dialogue, which comprises 84 quarto pages, are Longueil himself, who poses as an expert in ornithology, and a certain Pamphilus, who assumes the role of the curious student. The two men continue a conversation begun at a dinner the evening before, which was cut short because the women present wanted to chat about other things. Now Pamphilus desires to learn more. Longolius starts from an overview of the literature in the field, which is quite poor (fols. [A7v]–B2r). It is then decided to take a stroll to a grove where a great number of birds can be expected to be seen, because the weather is fine. On their excursion, Longueil and Pamphilus are accompanied by two fowlers  (aucupes), but these remain silent throughout. At a farm, the fowlers have breakfast, which gives the scholars the occasion to observe the barnyard fowl and to converse about galliforms (fols. B2r–[Dv]). After the breakfast, the party proceeds to the woods, and the subject of the conversation accordingly changes from tame to wild birds. In the middle of the discussion, the dialogue breaks off (fols. [D1v]–Gr). Turner appends a list of further bird names with German translations from Longueil's papers, which should have figured in the rest of the dialogue, as he explains in an introductory note. The volume is concluded by a number of funerary poems for Longueil and an elegy by Longueil himself.In the course of the dialogue, over 60 bird species are identified and discussed (the appended list contains another 24). Their names are indicated in the margins in Latin and German. Longueil teaches Pamphilus at least as much about bird terminology as about the birds themselves. In doing so, he generously quotes from ancient authorities, even in Greek (e.g. fol. [F7r], followed by a Latin translation). The action unfolding in the background does much to enliven the dialogue. So do a number of asides on general matters as well as a neat, graphic and easy style. The work's advertisment on the title page asnon minus festivus quam eruditus(""not less pleasant than learned"") is fully justified. On fols. C1v–2r, for instance, the recommendation of the intellectual virtue of curiosity is given a nice autoreferential twist:Pamph.: ""What did motivate this most learned man [Theophrastus] to study even the copulation of chickens?"" – Long.: ""Curiosity, the mother of knowledge of all things. Savants will therefore forgive us, too, when they learn that we discussed even the most minute details which I will bring to your attention in the realm of birds.""The change of a turkey's colours is precisely observed and lively described as follows (fol. [C7v]):Quid enim ista rubescens pellis aliud ac appendix quaedam cutis, quam nunc contrahit, nunc extendit, nunc caeruleo colore, mox pallido, deinde purpureo pro affectibus, ut apparet, suis pingit?""For what is this reddish hide other than a kind of outgrowth of its skin? Now it contracts it, now it puffs it up, now it colours it blue, than pale, finally purple, apparently according to its moods.""In sum, this dialogue is remarkable as one of the first purely ornithological works ever published, for the firm entrenchment of its specialised topic in the world of humanist learning, its wealth of good observations, and its literary qualities.",Vedder; Hoffmann; Peuster 2016,"Longueil, Gilbert de‎(← links)","Longueil, Gilbert de:Dialogus de avibus et earum nominibus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dialogus_de_avibus_et_earum_nominibus(last revision: 28.04.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

That it was composed by Rheticus himself is a probable guess based on his humanist education and the lack of an alternative attribution (whereas the hendecasyllables preceding the tables are ascribed to a certain Mathias). The speakers are two generic figures called Hospes (""stranger"", ""guest"") and Philomathes (""lover of mathematics""). Ph. apparently is a disciple of Rheticus, but H. is mathematically versed as well. He not only asks pertinent questions, but also quickly understands Ph.'s answers, picks them up and develops their implications. The dialogue should perhaps be imagined to take place in Leipzig, where Rheticus taught at the university (Academia nostra, fol. C iii v) until 1551.In a charming metalepsis, H. seems to hold theDirectoryin his hand when he opens the conversation with the observation:Inscriptio huius libelli pollicetur magna, sed quomodo muti tantum numerorum characteres triangulorum in planitie et in globo doctrinam aliquem docuerint?(""The title of this booklet promises great things, but how can dumb figures teach someone the doctrine of planar and spherical triangles?"") The ensuing discussion is animated and lively, but does not amount to a straightforward explanation of Rheticus' tables, as it touches on a considerable number of topics in quick and unpredictable succession: the contents of theDirectory; the necessity of mathematics for the knowledge of nature; Rheticus, the author of theDirectory; Rheticus andCopernicus;  Rheticus's publication plans; his ideas about teaching mathematics and astronomy; the correct use of his tables; the amount of labour saved by them; the advantages of calculating with the help of triangles instead of half-sines; Geber's (Dschabir ibn Aflah's) criticism of Ptolemy's application of Menelaus' theorem, which has become obsolete through Rheticus's work (in fact already byRegiomontanus'sDe triangulis omnimodis); sphaerical triangles; further trigonometric works planned by Rheticus; the convenience of his tables for astronomical calculations; uses and abuses of Rheticus'Ephemerides novae(1550). At the end, Ph. holds out to H. that he can meet Rheticus the other day, when teaching will be resumed after a holiday. H. promises to send Ph. a dinner invitation for one of the next evenings, and they part.While most early modern dialogues on scientific matters target experts and educated laymen alike, theDialogus de Canone doctrinae triangulorumappears to cater to the mathematically versed only. From a stylistic point of view, the text could be a pleasant read for a larger audience, since the Latin meets humanist standards in terms of idiomacy and is syntactically fluent. However, the terminology, which includes expressions such asdesignationes lineares,prostaphaeresisordoctrina περὶ τῶν ἀνελιττουσῶν, the numerous allusions to authors like Euclid, Ptolemy, Geber, Regiomontanus and Copernicus, the expected capacity of geometric imagination (fol. C iii r, top of the page) and the presupposed level of mathematical knowledge in general are apt to deter all but the most ingenious and daring among the non-initiated.",,"Rheticus, Georg Joachim‎(← links)Canon doctrinae triangulorum‎(← links)","Rheticus, Georg Joachim:Dialogus de Canone doctrinae triangulorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dialogus_de_Canone_doctrinae_triangulorum(last revision: 10.06.2021).",,"MK, IT, FB",Yes,"DB, MK",

As the detailed title page announces, the reader finds a dialogue at the end of the volume (pp. 141-149). In this short piece of fictive literature, Coelestinus (literally, ""the heavenly""), an astronomer from earth, travels to the moon, guided by Morpheus, the god of dreams. On his way up, Coelestinus is able to observe the daily motion of the earth. As soon as they have landed on the moon, Morpheus and Coelestinus meet a selenite, an inhabitant of the moon. The selenite invites them for a meal at his house, during which Coelestinus and the selenite engage in an astronomical discussion. In particular, their discussion focusses on the question whether the moon shines onto the earth, just as the earth shines onto the moon. While Coelestinus has the advantage of having witnessed both moonshine and - to his great surprise - earthshine, the selenite at first does not believe that the moon reflects the light of the sun onto the earth.After Coelestinus manages to convince his conversation partner, he defines a list of five further questions about which he is in doubt (1. is the earth, the moon, or the sun in the center of the universe?, 2. do the sun, the earth, the moon or the fixed stars have an annual movement? 3. do the earth or the moon have a monthly movement? 4. are the moon or earth in the ecliptic plane? 5. can one trust in the movement of the planets, as long as the annual or monthly movement of the sun,the earth or the moon are not known?) and stresses that among the wide variety of hypotheses and world systems, the simpler ones should be preferred. However, before the discussion can go any further, However, Coelestinus suddenly wakes up. Thus, it is finally revealed that the fantastic journey was nothing but a dream (of course, the fact that Coelestinus's guide is named Morpheus had hinted at this from the very beginning).In the short preface to the dialogue, the text is characterized asexterna bellaria [...], in quibus se tyro in uranicis φαινομένοις exercere quasi per ioco-seria possit(""a dessert outside [of the rest of the book], in which a beginner could exercise himself in the phenomena of the heavens in a serious, yet lighthearted way""). When Philalethes published his dialogue, he could build on a quite productive micro-tradition of (dialogical) dream stories that had formed in the 17th century in the wake of the debate between geocentric and heliocentric models and especially Galileo's telescopic discoveries. The protagonists of this dream narratives traveled the heavens, thus achieving a literal change of perspective on astronomical matters (cf.Libert Froidmont'sSomnium sive peregrinatio caelestisandAthanasius Kircher'sItinerarium exstaticumin this database). In terms of content, the most important inspiration for Philalethes probably came fromJohannes Kepler'sSomnium(1634), which had focussed on the perspective from the moon as well. However, the narrative frame and the style of Philalethes'sDialogus inter terricolam et lunicolamare very different from Kepler's text.From the very beginning, Philalethes's text takes the form of a direct dialogue. Only the very last sentence, in which Coelestinus awakes from his sleep, is written from the perspective of an external narrator. The text can be divided into three parts: the build-up to the astronomical discussion, consisting of Coelestinus and Morpheus flying to the moon, making the acquaintance of the selenite and being invited for dinner (pp. 141-143), the astronomical discussion itself (pp. 143-149), and Coelestinus's sudden awakening (pp. 149, only one sentence). Once the astronomical discussion starts, Morpheus, up until then a lively participant in the dialogue, falls silent. The setting of the learned dinner conversation that Philalethes uses is a classical setting for philosophical texts since antiquity. The selenite is charaterized as a learned man by the fact that he is keen on such a dinner tradition (p. 143), as well as the fact that he casually quotes poetry (p. 142) and observes the (selenite equivalent of) Aristotelian argumentation in the first astronomical paper he presents to Coelestinus (p. 144-145). In fact, in the course of the dialogue, two papers of the selenite are embedded into the dialogue: first, asynopsis demonstrativaon the light of the earth as perceived from the moon (pp. 144-145) and later, a 20-point catalogue of astronomical phenomena as perceived from the moon (pp. 146-147). In response to the latter, Coelestinus produces, probably as an oral ex-tempore ""document"", a catalogue of astronomical phenomena as perceived from the earth, which exactly mirrors the structure and order of the selenite's catalogue (pp. 148-149). With these three fictive documents, but especially Coelestinus's list of five questions, Philalethes incorporates elements of the style of treatises and dissertations into the dialogue, perhaps in order to prompt his readers to engage with the presented facts, arguments and problems, and to delve deeper into astronomy.Philalethes's take on the literary genre of the astronomical dream was only printed once and did not see a second edition.",,Philalethes (pseudonym)‎(← links),"Philalethes (pseudonym):Dialogus inter terricolam et lunicolam, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dialogus_inter_terricolam_et_lunicolam(last revision: 10.06.2021).","ad bellaria: A similar image had been employed by Froidmont in the preface to his ownSomnium sive peregrinatio caelestis.ContentSelenite: The earth and the moon stand still - the phases of the earth result from the movement of the sun.

"Se̜dziwój, Michał","Dialogus Mercurii, Alchymistae et Naturae. Scriptus in gratiam amici Coroades. Auctore eo, qui Divi Leschi genus amat",,1607,Cologne,Erffens,17th century,Dialogue,Alchemy/Chemistry,"Dialogus Mercurii, Alchymistae et Naturae(MDZ)",660345,"First printed as a little booklet of 28 pages, this anonymousDialogue Between Mercury, an Alchemist and Natureis a satire on the fruitless attempts of a foolish alchemist to create the philosophers' stone on the basis of mercury. While the dialogue is amusing to read, it is also a statement on the state of alchemy/chemistry at the time, juxtaposing the unlearned, profit-oriented alchemist (alchemysta) with the learned, noble philosopher (philosophus). This differentiation is also emphasised in the preface, where the intended audience, the ""lovers of true philosophy"" (verae philosophiae amatores) are put into stark contrast to the detested ""wicked mob of alchemists"" (profanum vulgus alchymistarum). Crucially, it is the alchemist as opposed to the philosopher, that is the target of the satire, not the quest for the philosophers' stone. Indeed, the reader is assured in the preface that the anonymous author of the dialogue has made and owns a perfect exemplar of the philosophers' stone.TheDialogue Between Mercury, an Alchemist and Natureconsists of a series of dialogues embedded in a narrative frame. The dialogue starts with a meeting of the chymists: they convene outside on a meadow, on a beautiful day, to discuss how to create the philosophers' stone. However, their discussion is interrupted by storm. Scattered across the provinces, the alchemists continue their work based on what they think the outcome of the discussion would have been –  among them the protagonist of the dialogue, who decides to use mercury as a basis for the philosophers' stone. He ""becomes a philosopher"" by reading some books he stumbled upon and starts to experiment with mercury. The alchemist's endeavour is riddled with stupid ideas and conclusions, which are exploited to comic effect. For example, when the alchemist heats up mercury for the first time, it evaporates, as it usually does. But the alchemist does not understand what happened and beats his wife, accusing her of having stolen his mercury (pp. 6–7). Similarly, when the alchemist treated mercury with all kinds of things without success, he stumbles upon the linequod in sterquilinio inveniturand becomes set on treating mercury with manure in order to obtain the philosophers' stone (pp. 7–8).
The fruitless attempts of the alchemist are interlaced with several dialogues. The alchemist has two conversation with a mysterious old man who appears to him first in a dream and then in a hallucination. Mercury also appears to him twice, as the alchemist curses the substance of the same name. Mercury feigns to be obedient to the ""great philosopher"" with biting sarcasm, but mocks and attacks him angrily later on. Finally, Nature herself appears to the alchemist and delivers a damning verdict on him in the last lines of the text.The alchemist is also characterized on a linguistic level. His clumsy Latin betrays his attempt to pose as a philosopher. For example, he saysmutas te(p. 19) instead ofmutarisand repeatedly usesquod-clauses instead of accusative-and-infinitive constructions (scis quod, p. 15,dicunt quod, p. 17,video quod, p. 27). In one instance, the alchemist'squod-clause (ALCH.Non frustra de te dicunt, quod mirabilis es et inconstans et volatilis) is juxtaposed directly with Mercury's more elegant accusative-and-infinitive construction (MERC.Tu me dicis esse inconstantem, hoc tibi sic solvo: constans sum constanti artifici, fixus fixo animo [...]), suggesting that the god mocks not only the alchemist's science, but his Latin too.In the preface, the dialogue is characterized as atractatulusthat has been written in little time and, on the request of the author's friend, in ""very simple words and a very low register of style"" (verbis simplicissimis et stylo tenuissimo). As mercury is only one of threeprincipiaof the philosophers' stone, the ""editor"" (who also remains anonymous) promises to press his friend, the author, to produce works on the other two principles, salt and sulfur, and other works beyond that. One year after it was published, the dialogue was included in theNovum lumen chymicum, which saw multiple editions in the seventeenth century. As part of this collection, the dialogue was also translated intoGerman,French,English, Dutch and Russian (cf.Prinke 2016).While theNovum lumen chymicumenjoyed great popularity, the authorship of its works became a matter of debate, as the treatises began to be attributed to a mysterious Englishman called ""the cosmopolitan"", a figure later identified with the alchemist Alexander Seton. However, the key to the author's identity can be found on the title page of the dialogue, where the author is characterized asqui Divi Leschi genus amat(""who loves the people of divine Lech [the mythical founder of Poland]""). The same pseudonym had been used seven years earlier in a treatise on the philosophers' stone,De lapide philosophorum(Autor sum, qui Divi Leschi genus amo). In fact,Divi Leschi genus amois an anagram ofMichael Sendivogius, the Latin name of the Polish alchemist Michał Se̜dziwój, who was one of the most well-known alchemists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (on the debate on the authorship cf.Prinke 2016).",Prinke 2016,"Se̜dziwój, Michał‎(← links)","Se̜dziwój, Michał:Dialogus Mercurii, Alchymistae et Naturae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dialogus_Mercurii,_Alchymistae_et_Naturae(last revision: 27.07.2021).","Text beginnt im Evangelienstil (In illo tempore ... et ... et)At the time the dialogue was printed, Sendivogius belonged to the court of Emperor Rudolf II.

Opus nunc recens natum et in lucem editum.",,1540,Cologne,"Schönstenius, Johann",16th century,Dialogue,"Biology, Medicine",Dialogus qui inscribitur botanomethodus(Google Books),660343,"This dialogue written by the otherwise quite obscuregrammaticus(teacher of Latin, perhaps also of Greek and the trivium) Carolus Figulus is noteworthy for its explicitly didactic character. It provides an introduction not to the body of knowledge of botanical pharmacology itself, but to the basic categories of this discipline. This should enable the beginner to find his way into the field methodically and quickly, a goal emphasised in the title (A Dialogue Titled ""The Method of Botany"") as well as in an epigram on the title page by the publisher Johann Schönstenius: ""Reader, look, I am selling you a method through which you will find yourself better instructed to go out into the gardens, fields and woods. For this method will teach you briefly and easily how to look for any herb whatsoever.""The work is dedicated to the archbishop of Cologne, Hermann V. von Wied. As the letter of dedication explains, the author spent some time in Cologne while on his way to Paris in 1540, where he seems to have been offered a job by the humanistically minded cardinal Jean de Bellay. During his stay, he was exhorted by the abovementioned publisher (amagister artium, by the way), the young doctor Kornelius Sittard and the humanist and botanist Gisbert Longolius to compose the dialogue.The dialogue itself comprises 42 quarto pages and takes place between Figulus and Sittard. The roles of the two speakers are not fixed, but change according to the topics coming up in the course of the conversation. When botanical and pharmacological contents are discussed, Sittard takes the lead and answers the questions of thegrammaticusFigulus; when logical and terminological aspects are concerned, it is the other way round.  The occasion of the dialogue is a visit payed to Sittard by Figulus in the – apparently very hot and dry – summer of 1540. After the two men have had a look at Sittard's garden, where most herbs have unfortunately withered, Figulus asks Sittard to help him become an expert in pharmacology (A iii r–v). The ensuing conversation starts from a definition of the termherbaand a subdivision of herbs according to various criteria (A iii v–A iv v). In the main part, the subject is discussed according to the four Aristotelian causes. The efficient cause of herbs is God (A iv v–C r). Regarding the material cause, in a certain sense they have none, since God created themex nihilo; in another sense, thecausa materialisis the four elements, earth in particular (fol. C r–C ii v). Under the heading ""formal cause"", the most extensive of all (fol. C ii v–F 3 v), many characteristics of herbs are reviewed: size, shape, colour, smell, taste (colours and tastes being set out in tables),crasis, i.e. the mixture of the qualities hot, cold, dry and moist, andvires, i.e. healing powers. The final cause, the preservation of the health of mankind, is only mentioned in a single sentence on the very last page (fol. F 3 v). A discussion of the medical effects of herbs, which Figulus would have desired, has to be postponed, because it has become evening. Sittard invites Figulus for dinner, but the latter has already accepted an invitation by Schönstenius, the printer.The dialogue's framework is fleshed out with discussions of many specific herbs and flowers. It also allows for lengthy digressions. Under ""efficient cause"", for example, the notion of God as theauctorof herbs leads to an account of the way He governs the world, Adam's naming of all things including herbs, the preservation of their original names in contemporary Hebrew and a catalogue of the best pharmaceutical authors and works (fol. B r–B iii r). The somewhat arbitrary and unpredictable development of the dialogue endows it with something of the liveliness of a real conversation. In other parts, however, colloquial realism is largely absent, as the two participants work through their material in a quite systematic and even mechanical way. As already suggested, the dialogue is as much about theverbaas about theresof botany and pharmacy. Questions of terminology are regularly discussed. Numerous Greek terms and quotations from Greek works are inserted and translated into Latin. In the marginalia as well as in the tables of colours and smells, German and French terms are added as well. The style is generally vivid, syntactically simple but lexically rich. Occasionally, the account is enlivened by a catchy comparison, as when the colour of a kind of anagallis is likened to the glow of a coal (fol. E 2 r):Plane talis color est in carbone accenso.However, the most salient linguistic feature is probably the neologismbotanomethodusin the title, no doubt coined to underline the work's novelty.",,"Figulus, Carolus‎(← links)","Figulus, Carolus:Dialogus qui inscribitur botanomethodus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dialogus_qui_inscribitur_botanomethodus(last revision: 22.04.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In close reference to Aristotle and his meteorology, Reusser classifies snow as aqueous meteorum; as winter is due to begin soon (according to the title page, the dissertation was proposed on December 8th, 1627), it seems useful to present a dissertation on snow.  Reusser describes his studies as a pilgrimage requiring gods help; otherwise, it would develop into a wandering. He therefore asks god for helping him present the truth in this dissertation.Dissertation (p. 3-7):The dissertation itself contains 27 paragraphs (p. 3-7). Reusser himself arranges the text according to the four Aristotelian causes (matter, form, agent, end), which, at a first glance, provokes the impression of a certain artificiality, as some sections and questions are overlapping resp. exceeding the borders defined by these causes. This impression is underlined by a twofold structure within the short document: On the one hand, Reusser mentions the Aristotelian causes several times, but, on the other hand, he mixes them with not fully equivalent questions positioned within the single paragraphs, starting from the general question “an nix sit” (if snow exists at all), followed by “quid sit” (for the causa materialis) and “qualis sit” (for the causa formalis). Especially these categories concerning “matter” and “form”, described in §3-18, appear rather intermingled than carefully defined. Likewise, the categories “agent” and “end” seem somehow coherent; they are discussed in §20-27, accompanied by the questions on the causa efficiens (“cur…”) and the causa finalis (… “& quam ob causam nix in rerum natura sit & existat”).§1 Introduction and (theoretical/philosophical) concept: The four Aristotelic causes
§1: It seems necessary – and there is “nihil ordinatius” – to proceed not a-philosophically, but to rely on the four Aristotelic causes: matter, form, agent, end.§2-18: First section: “Causa materialis” (§3-10) and “causa formalis” (§11-18)
§2: It is not hard to proof that snow exists; on the contrary, it would be ridiculous to abnegate the existence of what is physically visible. Reusser answers the question “an nix sit”: In this strictly ontological sense, it does.
§3: If a phenomenon is proven to exist, its very nature is to be explored (Reusser relates with “quid [nix] sit” to the “causa materialis”): Following the textual structure of the dissertation, the following paragraphs primarily deal with this “causa materialis”; but, in terms of their content, the paragraphs somehow overlap with the “causa formalis”, and therefore the distinction between “material” and “formal” seems quite relative at this point.
§4: The first duty of a “sapiens” is to search for the right definition – this is the right starting point for further discussion of the subject in question.
§5: To avoid ambiguousness and “homonymy”, the subject in question needs a good delimitation and a proper definition; if not, errors can happen.
§6: Therefore, a thorough etymological research is necessary: References to Ovid, Virgil, Horace, Psalms (147, 16). Cf., e.g., the approach in the 1647 “Disputatio physica de glacie” (by Vriesen & Schoock).
§7: Based on the previous paragraphs, Reusser comes to the following conclusion, i.e., definition: “Nix est nubes friabili densitate conglaciata” – Before the clouds can turn back into water, they are, descending, frozen by the cold, like carded wool. (cf. §9 and, e.g., the similar theorem 1 on “carded wool” in 1659 “De nive” by Leutmann & Kirchmaier).
§8: “Nubes” is seen as the main constituent (Reusser: “materia”) of snow: The warm and humid vapors of clouds freeze into snow; the result of the transformation depends on the temperature: if cold, the result is rain; if colder, the result is snow; if very cold, the result is hail. At this point, Reusser uses the term “materia” – this creates a certain unintentional ambiguity (nivis materia VS causa materialis, cf. §2).
§9-10 are about the twofold “forma” of snow: Reusser distinguishes a so called “forma interna” (§9) from a so called “forma externa” (§10). According to the author, the “forma interna” consists of the way snow is formed, namely in the “media aeris regione, quae frigidissima est et sedes nubium”, and not in the lower regions. Following Reuss, the “forma externa” consists of white and falling snowflakes, described as “wool” in the Psalms.
At the first glance, this subdivision into extern and intern “forma” seems quite nebulous, probably because of the terms Reusser uses. If §9 is seen as chapter about the “internal formation” of snow and §10 about the “external manifestation” of this formation, the reasoning behind seems easier to understand. Certainly, one might count the §9-10 to the following section (§11-18) about the “causa formalis”.
In §11, Reusser turns to the causa formalis (“qualis [nix] sit”). As previously observed, the division into “causa materialis” and “causa formalis” seems quite artificial and leads to a certain repetitiveness: On the one hand, Reusser again intends to talk about the “qualitates”, on the other hand he wants to inform about the “effectiones”, which seem to refer to the proper Aristotelian efficient cause (or producing). The author motivates his decision by arguing that qualities do not only indicate differences, but that they are also mark different conditions of the “essentia” (“essentiarum affectiones”). One might note the lexical similarities (effectio, differentia, essential, affectio, “asserente [sic?] Aristotele”).
§12: Snow is white, because whiteness (“albedo”) is the most important constituent of the particles mostly consisting of air. For this reason, spume is white, as well as “aqua oleo infuso” – a rather cryptic observation, as oil and water do not mix. Reusser perhaps refers to the optical refraction of oil bubbles in water; he certainly refers to Aristotle and Pliny.
§ 13: The white brightness (“candor”) of snow is a real color – and does not, as some scholars believe, only appear as color, as it happens in other aerial concretions: Snow has a true color, otherwise it could not last so long, likewise in compressed snow which is not translucent.
§ 14: In addition to the “albedo” (mentioned above), there is another cause for the brightness (“candor”) of snow: the cold (“frigiditas”). Reusser offers the following explanation: The cold is responsible for brightness in various other occurrences, therefore, e.g., people living in the north are “candidiores sunt Meridionalibus”.
§ 15-16: About the reddening and/or blackening of snow – this is caused by the stepwise disappearance of aerial particles; the lack of these particles leads to the preponderance of a certain “qualitatum mixtura”, which then effectuates the different colors; one major example: Armenia, where red snow is said to fall.
§ 17: Winter and early spring are the ideal time for snow. One particularity is mentioned: In these seasons, the cold occupies the lowest aerial regions, whereas the central aerial regions are warmer, thus preventing vapors to condense and rainwater to form.
§ 18: About the shape (“figura”) of snow, which is said to be rather wide than concentrated (“lata… magis quam conglobata”); this shape is caused by the gradual freezing processes which takes place in the (also widespread) clouds.§19-20: Connecting passage to the second section
§19: Reusser now goes on to investigate the causa efficiens and the causa finalis (“cur & quam ob causam nix in rerum natura sit & existat”).
§ 20: In this paragraph, Reusser again names the four questions (materialis, formalis, efficiens, finalis). Whereas the material and the formal question have been discussed in the previous paragraphs, the “causa efficiens” as well as the “causa finalis” are to be examined in the following paragraphs.§21-23: Second section: “Causa efficiens” (§21-23) and “causa finalis” (§24-27):
§21: Heading for the two following paragraphs on the causa efficiens, which is described as “duplex”: 
§22: The general and more remote “causa efficiens” for snow is the same as the universal cause: god; this assumption is based on three quotations from the bible. 
§23: The specific and closer “causa efficiens” for snow is the cold, which befalls and condenses the clouds step-by-step. If this process took place all at the same time, it would lead to rainfall. 
In §24-27, Reusser turns to the causa finalis; the author adds a further division into three “utilitates” (§24, §25-26, §27). The “prima utilitas” as first use/benefit of snow is the fertility of fields (reference to Pliny, Theophrastus); causing changes in the mixing proportion of the elements and their qualities, snow layers on fields boost their fertility.
§25-26: The “secunda utilitas” is the generation of crystals under very cold conditions – in contrast to later dissertations, Reusser still trusts older sources on this matter and follows the traditional Greek etymology and talks about crystals found on the highest peaks in the Alps. 
§27: The “tertia utilitas” is the strengthening of the hands: Who washes his hands in snowmelt, strengthens them, because of the dry and earthen vapors in snow.Colophon: “Coronidis loco quaedam apposuimus”: Short statements/further questions on snow (p. 7-8)
Instead of a (perhaps more expressive or directive) colophon, Reussen concludes his work with seven short statements on snow. Interestingly, this passage is – in form and content – similar to the 1649 “Exercitium physicum de Nive.”I: Snow is softer than rime.
II: Snow can be found on high mountains, while there is no snow in the lowlands and valleys.
III: The generation of snow starts in (relatively) warm places (he uses “calidior”).
IV: The generation of snow is completed in (relatively) cold places (he uses “frigidior”).
V: Snow is generated “tempore frigido”. (cf. §8, whereas rain is generated under warmer conditions.)
VI: Snow is generated “tempore calidiori”. At first glance, V and VI are contradictory. A possible explanation might be the circular process of condensation and congelation (as mentioned above, especially in §8 and also in §17. Hail is generated under very cold conditions).
VII: There are two species of snow, here named in Greek: “chion” (snow) and “niphetos” (falling snow).Critical acclaim / Two short poems by a certain “M. Joh. Brunnius” (p. 8)
The short poems are dedicated to the “respondens” Reusser. The first one attests Reusser a lucid mind, comparing it to the white snowflakes, and wishes him success and god’s blessing. The second one states that the now educated (Reusser) should not stop studying and thus continue gaining its helpful benefits (Reusser writes: “auxilium”), whereas fate (""sors"") might be hazardous.",UK,Yes,UK,

Even today, hisThesaurus linguae Graecae(1572) has not been completely superseded. The presentMedical Dictionary, which Estienne compiled and published a few years earlier, is likewise exceptional for its philological accuracy.Comprising over 300 quarto pages in itself, theDictionaryis preceded and followed by a number of additional lexica or lexicographical extracts which between them amount to about the same length. At the beginning, one finds the Greek text of the Hippocratic lexica by Erotianus (pp. 5–53, aneditio princeps) and Galen (pp. 54–104), to which two short, anonymous pieces concerned with Herodotean and Ionic expressions have been added for good measure (pp. 105–12). Next come Estienne's comments on the first two lexica together with a few additions byConrad Gessner(pp. 113–80) and an interesting collection of remarks by Galen on Hippocrates' language and style (pp. 181–92). TheDictionary(pp. 193–518) is followed by a series of excerpts concerned with medical terminology from Ps.-Galen'sIsagoge, Galen'sDe methodo medendi, Rufus'De appellationibus partium corporis  humani, theIsagoge(again), Galen'sDe ossibus ad tironesand Julius Pollux'Onomasticon. Most of these Greek texts are provided with Latin translations (pp. 519–608). In terms of paratexts, Estienne dedicates the book, about whose long gestation he jokes, to his friend, the physician Philibert Sarasin (pp. 3–4). The volume is concluded by a list of corrigenda and an index. As can be seen from this enumeration of contents, Estienne intends to gather as much information about medical terminology as possible (except terms formateria medica, see p. 5), but for him, this means exclusively the Greek terminology of the classical authors. Arabic terms as well as early modern ones (such as the anatomical nomenclature introduced byVesalius) are of no concern to him.Consequently, theMedical Dictionaryitself contains words and explanations from seven ancient Greek, two Byzantine (Paul of Aegina and Ioannes Actuarius, 7th and 13/14th century respectively) and one Roman author (Celsus, first century BC/AD), all of which are duly enumerated in the full title. The lemmata seem to be chosen for there absence from the other texts in the volume, so that Estienne's lexicon complements the ancient lexicographical tradition. The terms are arranged in strictly alphabetical order, centred on the page to render them more salient, and invariably in Greek. Estienne gives no definitions of his own. Rather, each lemma is followed by a series of substantial (up to one full page) extracts from ancient authors in which the word in question is either explained or its meaning becomes clear from the context. These quotations are subsequently translated into Latin, including a Latin translation or transliteration of the term in question itself. At the end of each quotation, its origin is indicated in the styleAegineta lib. 4 cap. 5(p. 397). The length of the single entries implies that the overall number of words discussed is modest: it does not exceed some 300. In principle, such an approach was defensible in view of the numerous companion pieces and the index. Nonetheless, students and doctors presumably found medical dictionaries which covered the entire field of medicine in a greater number of shorter entries, such as Otto Brunfels'Ὀνομαστικόν medicinae(1534), more convenient in practice. Perhaps for this reason, theMedical Dictionarywas never reprinted.",,"Estienne, Henri‎(← links)","Estienne, Henri:Dictionarium medicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dictionarium_medicum(last revision: 05.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In 1583, a second and definitive edition came out, which had been expanded by more than one half (plus dimidio auctum), as proudly proclaimed on the title page. It was reprinted unchanged the year after. The work is quite similar to the roughly contemporaryOnomasticon Theophrasti Paracelsi, but in contrast to this polyglot lexicon, it explains Paracelsus' playful and idiosyncratic word creations in Latin only. As Dorn had translated many Paracelsian works into the learned tongue, his dictionary may have been conceived primarily as an aid for reading Paracelsus in his own Latin versions.The lexicon is introduced by a letter to Dorn's friend, the doctor Samuel Eisenmenger or Siderocrates (pp. 3–8), to whom the author already had dedicated two commentaries on Paracelsus (p. 7), and by a note to the reader (pp. 9–10). The former, which justifies the obscurity of Theophrastus' writings with the necessity to hide his holy wisdom from hoi polloi, is written in a somewhat hermetic style itself and frequently puns upon the wordsal(salt) in three different meanings: as one of the Paracelsian principles, the biblical salt of the earth, and a knowledge of secret things. The letter to the reader starts from stressing the need of knowing Paracelsus' terminology in order to understand his writings:Ad Paracelsi quoscumque libros intelligendum ex eius mente genuina in primis ac prae ceteris maxime tibi necessarium erit singula, quibus ludere suo more delectatur suis cum discipulis interdum, vocabula peregrina probe et ad unguem cognita habeas.In the end, it is explained that the new edition of theDictionaryis in octavo so that it can be bound with any of Paracelsus’ books in this format.The dictionary itself (pp. 11–94) is concise and fully alphabetised. Most entries do not exceed a couple of lines, but the explanation ofAethnaruns to two pages (pp. 11–13), andHomunculuseven gives occasion to a short treatise (pp. 48–54). The form of the entries is simple and standardised, in that the lemma word is followed byest(or less frequentlydicitur,significat) and the explanation. Most of Dorn's definitions prove helpful to the uninitiated, as for instance in the case ofaniaday, whichvernum tempus significat aeternum et novum in futuro mundum et paradisum(""means the eternal spring, the new world of the future, and the paradise"", p. 16). Some, however, follow the principle ofobscurum per obscurius:Ideus est architectus mentalis(""Ideus is the architect of the mind"");Iesahach est supernaturale(""Iesahach is the supernatural""; both p. 54). For the modern reader, a few entries, such asMelusinaeandSylvestres(pp. 65, 87), provide interesting information about early modern folk beliefs.In 1650, theDictionarium Theophrasti Paracelsiwas translated into English (Tonelli 1971, 15).

The main body of the text is preceded by two introductory letters, to Cortese's patron Cardinal Doria and the reader respectively, and a brief astronomical vocabulary in which in order to make the material more accessible to non-professional readers, Cortese explains main astronomical/astrological terms. In the letters, Cortese states that new findings claimed by contemporary astronomers should be rejected, while his book, which is said to be of moderate length but, at the same time, of great importance, summarised ""real"" astronomical novelties. In his own words, the structure and, in general, the whole astronomical/astrological discourse of the treatise are determined by Sacrobosco's Sphaera. Although as some passages of the text reveal Cortese was familiar with contemporary astronomical debates and mentions, for instance, the names ofBrahe, Tychoand several seventeenth-century astrologers, his task is to restore the high position of medieval astrology, in his opinion, strongly connected with astro-medicine and thus personified in the figure of Sacrobosco. This approach of presenting the previous and outdated tradition as ""novelty"", while simultaneously rejecting all actual new findings, is an interesting case of how early modern scholars used the notion of ""novelty"" for the benefit of their theories and in order to persuade the reader that their writings contain reliable knowledge.In this respect, the Discursus novissimus is paired up with another treatise by Cortese, the Discursus duplex (Naples, 1645) in which with the use of similar arguments he pursued the same goal.","Pizzamiglio 2004, 244-45.","Cortese, Pietro‎(← links)","Cortese, Pietro:Discursus astronomicus novissimus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Discursus_astronomicus_novissimus(last revision: 28.01.2022).",,,Yes,OA,

First composed and published in 1571 as a treatise in thirteen books (Venice: De Franceschi), the treatise was expanded by Patrizi himself and republished in 1581 in Basel. It presents one of the most significant and systematic attacks on the still dominating Aristotelian philosophical framework. A consistent and harsh opponent to Aristotle and the 'Aristotelian school', Patrizi deconstructs, step by step, the grounds of Aristotelian philosophy, investigating the discrepancies within the tradition and claiming that the framework is not valid anymore to describe the origin of natural philosophical phenomena as well as all other disciplines at the time based on Aristotelian writings. In Tome 1, Patrizi analyses, in great detail and providing numerous references to original Greek sources, the life and works of Aristotle and focuses on major errors in his oeuvre and its subsequent commentary tradition; in the rest of the treatise, he compares Aristotle to what he considers to be the best 'replacement' to the outdated philosophical framework, that is Plato and, on the one hand, hispriscipredecessors (Zoroaster, Hermes Trismegistus andalii) and, on the other hand, the 'Platonic school'. In this respect, Patrizi follows the doctrine ofprisca theologia, which owed its success in the Renaissance period to Marsilio Ficino and Agostino Steuco. In addition, Patrizi's intention to deconstruct the Aristotelian tradition was for sure inspired by Bernardino Telesio'sDe rerum natura iuxta propria principiaand later reflected in theNova de universis philosophia.",,"Patrizi, Francesco‎(← links)Discussionum peripateticarum(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Patrizi, Francesco:Discussiones peripateticae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Discussiones_peripateticae(last revision: 21.09.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

Cremonini, a renowned professor of theology at Padua, is universally recognised as one of the most influential opponents of the ""new cosmology"". Widely propagated in early seventeenth-century Italy by scholars such as Galileo Galilei whom Cremonini encountered in Padua, the heliocentric ideas faced severe opposition among various intellectual circles of the time. Cremonini embodies one such approach to denouncing heliocentrism. Unlike some of his contemporaries, for instance, Riccioli, for whom the Copernican worldview contradicted both natural philosophy and theology, and for whom the ultimate goal was to reconcile, as effectively as possible, new scientific ideas with Christian teaching, Cremonini stayed away from discussing theological ramifications of the new cosmology. Instead, he advocated a virtual, and rather radical, return to a ""pure"" Aristotle. He aims to restore the position of the Stagirite's corpus as the most authoritative writings in natural philosophy and cosmology. This intention goes so far as to prefer Aristotle's teaching over the Scriptures in those cases when they seemingly contradict each other with regard to the natural order. TheDisputatioexemplifies this approach most clearly.The work is divided into three major parts and thus does not explicitly imitate the four-part structure of Aristotle'sDe coelo. However, Cremonini structures his material so that the treatise touches upon all the major cosmological topics discussed in Aristotle's work and relevant to the early seventeenth-century context. That is why he generally avoids discussing the fourth book of theDe coelo, which deals with a slightly different subject matter, that is, the notions of ""heavy"" and ""light"". In each section, Cremonini provides a short summary of what different scholars thought about the nature and the motion of heavens and ends up stating that Aristotle's interpretation of the celestial design was the only satisfactory. This determines the way he closely comments on Aristotle's treatise, with the intention to demonstrate that regardless of any cosmological novelties, the Aristotelian framework should remain intact. In terms of style and language, Cremonini's treatise is largely scholastic and testifies once again to the fact that the influence of and the adherence to the humanist movement was far from being universal.",,"Cremonini, Cesare‎(← links)","Cremonini, Cesare:Disputatio de coelo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disputatio_de_coelo(last revision: 19.11.2021).",,,Yes,OA,

If the title can be trusted, the author, an otherwise unknown Daniel van Goens, rather wrote this work himself to earn hismagister artiumand coincidentally hisdoctor philosophiae. He dedicated it to five more or less distinguished relatives in the form of an ellogium, a kind of pseudo-inscription on paper.Whether the moon is inhabited or not, has already been discussed in antiquity, as the author is well aware (§ I). He does not presume to decide this question, but only wants to reckon if the notion of an inhabited moon can be called probable or not – and he does so in a very systematic way. First, he defines ""probable"": A thesis is probable if a sufficient number of its preconditions can be shown to be true (§ II). Then, he lists nine such preconditions, which he takes from the conditions obtaining on earth: The moon must be solid, provide its inhabitants with food, have fertile soil, water, an atmosphere, clouds and rain as well as a reasonably temperate climate and allow the selenians to make fire, produce pottery and agricultural tools (§§ III–IV). In examining these preconditions one after the other (§§ V–XV), van Goens shows good knowledge of a range of natural scientific disciplines from optics and astronomy to geology, biology and medicine. He also generously quotes older and contemporary authorities on the respective topics. In the end, he concludes that only the first precondition is sure or at least plausible. Therefore, the moon's habitability is extremely questionable (§ XVI).TheDisputatioproper is followed by 19 propositions covering a wide range of fields from geometry (VI: if someone rounds the earth, his head travels farther than his feet) to chemistry and mineralogy (e.g. XV: coloured kinds of sand and stone contain iron). These propositions, titledCorollaria, are perhaps the theses van Goens had to defend during the academicdisputatio pro gradu(cf. for this phenomenon Caspar Bussingius'De situ telluris Paradisiacae et chiliasticae Burnetiano ad eclipticam recto).The author not only structures his work clearly but also writes in plain, precise Latin.

In 1646, with Martin Schoock aspraeses, the following fourdisputationes physicaewere printed by Augustin Eissen in Groningen:Disputatio physica de nive(proponens: a Stralen)Disputatio physica de glacie(proponens: Vriesen)Disputatio physica de hyeme(proponens: Bertlingh)Disputatio physica de aqua(proponens: Wittichius)The dedication by Bernhard Vriesen expresses his gratitude to his professor, Martin Schoock.A short preface (4 lines), written in the first person plural, informs the reader about the motivation for writing about the hiemal by-product of ice: an apparently week-long, bridge-like, congelation of water.The dissertation's main part is divided into 58 theses which are practically paragraphs; it seems useful to subdivide the text into different segments:
§§ 1–2: Etymology and definition of ice
§§ 3–6: Deliberations about the very nature of ice: it is not a realmeteorum, not a mere aqueous impurity, but in fact a certain transformation of water.
§§ 7–11: Four preconditions for the genesis of ice; these are: a) warm terrestrial exhalations, b) terrestrial and gross vapors, c) aqueous humidity and d) external cold.
§ 12: Following §§ 7–11, § 12 presents the following theory about the genesis of ice: The cold leads to the agglomeration of the denser water particles, whereas the lighter water particles mostly evaporate resp. partially form air bubbles in the ice.
§§ 13–21 deal, with questions arising from the theory formulated in § 12, e.g., about the states of aggregation of vinegar (§ 13), oil (§§ 14–15, cf. the references to Aristotle), sea water (§ 16), wine (§ 17), about the presence of hot particles in ice (§ 18), about the extension of ice beneath the water surface (§ 19), about the fact that ice floats on water (§ 20), about the freezing of vapor (§ 21). These paragraphs might be seen as the first main part.
§§ 22–23 work as a synopsis for the second and third main parts. The paragraphs name so calledconsiderandafor a better understanding of ice. To be considered are:adiuncta(§§ 24–35, cf. below),circumstantia temporis(§§ 35–37),duratio(§§ 38–41),locus ubi generatur(§§ 42–44),effectus(§§ 45),usus(§§ 46–54), comparisons between ice and water (§§ 55–58).
§§ 24–35 treat the mentionedadiuncta; these concomitant factors of ice are divided into the sub-aspects slipperiness (§§ 24–26), pellucidity (§§ 27–28), albedo (§ 29), hardness (§§ 30–31), degree of cold (§ 32), humidity (§ 33) and natural openings in ice (§ 34).The dissertation is concluded by three poems, dedicated to Bernhard Vriesen, here named asrespondens, the first byFranciscus ab Appelthorn(nickname: Velua-Gelrus), the second and third apparently by fellow students.",,"Schoock, Martin‎(← links)Vriesen, Bernhard‎(← links)Disputatio physica de glacie (1689)‎(← links)","Vriesen, Bernhard; Schoock, Martin:Disputatio physica de glacie, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disputatio_physica_de_glacie(last revision: 12.01.2022).","As other dissertations on similar subjects, § 1 begins with the etymology of the terminus “glacies”, tracing it back to “gelu” as well as distinguishing it from the Greek “krystallos” and the Latin “crystallus”, certainly underlining structural similarities between ice and crystals. If crystals were formed of ice, they would be found especially in boreal regions and could melt in water. § 2 differentiates the term “glacies” between its general meaning (every frozen liquid) and its particular meaning (water stiffened by strong frost and easily meltable by heat): the dissertation will limit itself to this particular meaning, observing only water and very similar liquids (“qui ad aquae proprie dictae naturam vergunt, aut ei proportione respondent”).By discussing the very nature of ice resp. its constituent parts, §§ 3–6 aim to classify the phenomenon “ice”, e.g., into the “meteora”. The primary questions is whether ice is a “meteorum aqueum”, an “aquae corruptio” or an “aquae affectio” (=commutatio, i.e., transformation) (§ 3). § 4: Unlike hail, ice should not easily to be assigned to the “meteora”, although ice and hail share, to a certain degree, similarities: Ice does not consolidate from vapors (as hail as a “meteorum” does), however, ice is seen as a transformation of the aqueous element and does not form without agglomerations of vapor. § 5: Likewise, considering the melting process of the phenomenon, ice does not easily qualify as mere water impurity, but as a partial “corruptio”: in the freezing process, water loses whatever lightness it might possess, whereas it holds back turbid, heavy, gross and crude particles and gains dryness. § 6 comes to the following conclusion: Ice is a certain transformation of water (“aquae affectio”), because “nihil aliud [sit] quam aqua externo frigore condensata”: not only water, but also external “frigus” is necessary for the transformation from water to ice. In addition, without the condition of external “frigus” (presumably meant cold air), ice would not float on water: “quod fieri non posset, si solum frigus sufficeret, hoc enim gravitatem augeret.” (§ 6)§ 7 is a connecting passage to §§ 8–11, dealing with the four preconditions for the genesis of ice: § 8: The first condition: warm terrestrial exhalations. They produce the floatability of ice; without them, ice would be too heavy to float; the exhalations volatilize resp. can be observed when ice melts. 
§ 9: The second condition: terrestrial and gross vapors. They cause the solidification of ice, and if they are absent (e.g., in pure water), water cannot freeze: Hence, the more terrestrial vapors are in water, the easier is the freezing process.
§ 10: The third condition: aqueous humidity. Without humidity, ice could not last, and the two previous conditions (“duum generum halitus”) could not merge without the addition of humidity to contain them (“ad eos continendos”).
§ 11: The fourth condition: external cold. It is the binding element, and this cold must come from outside, not from inside the water (“frigus aquae congenitum”).§ 12: Following §§ 7–11, § 12 presents the following theory about the genesis of ice: The denser water particles (the aqueous and earthen particles) are driven together by the cold: this agglomeration first expels many of the lighter water particles, then, secondly, causes the volatilization of the remaining particles: they do not exhale into the air, but move into the ice and can there be observed as air bubbles like “in pumice”.§ 13 is, in its first part, a connecting passage which introduces various “dubia” which might arise from the above statement. The following paragraphs name different aqueous subjects which happen to turn into ice („quibus haec glaciei affectio accidit“). In the second part of the paragraph, dubium 1 is presented as well as the explanation: Vinegar does not easily freeze, it is in fact dominated by cold, but the vinegars tenuity prevents it from freezing, because there are no “partes crassae” in vinegar.
§ 14–15 present dubium 2 about oil: although its congelation in small flasks (“oleum in gutto congelatum”) is described by some scholars, experience and authors (among them the “philosophus” per se, Aristotle, in his meteorology and “De Generatione Animalium”) give proof that oil does only undergo a process of solidification (“incrassere”). 
§ 16 presents dubium 3 about the sea [water]: Whilst some state that only sweet water can freeze, the dissertation gives examples for frozen seas and references to Herodot and “tot sine numero authores alios”. The dissertation acknowledges that sea water has a certain resistance against congelation, for the following reasons: “superabundans” saltiness (because of the adherent warmth), motion and agitation, the absence of external cold (e.g., in the Mediterranean).
§ 17 presents dubium 4 about wine: It is clear why wine freezes more slowly than other liquids: In wine, light particles are superabundant as well as there is much “spirituum igneorum”. The same goes for brine, where salty particles are predominant. 
§ 18 presents “dubium” 5, dealing with the question, whether “in glacie occurrere quid ipso igni calidius”: The authors answer seems rather cautious, but it is positive (“a vero enim alienum illud non esse”), as the warm exhalation (cf. above) can be compared with the elementary fire.
§ 19 presents dubium 6 about the extension of ice beneath the water, deliberating whereas water freezes only on the surface or not, in other words: Where the freezing process starts and how deep into the water it extends. The text states (again) that warm exhalations (ice floats because of their lightness!) volatilize and are driven into the ice by the cold; the conclusion is that the freezing process mostly happens on the surface, but can also continue “in profundo”, and ice can expand into the depths.
§ 20 presents dubium 7 about the floatability of ice: While ice – due to the aggregation (“condensatio”) – might seem heavier than water, it still floats; the text refers again to the mentioned warm exhalations and then corrects the theory of a certain Roderigo de Arriaga (Disputatio de generatione).
§ 21 presents dubium 8 about the popular question whether vapor can freeze or not. In contrast to the popular opinion, experiments with closed water filled bottles give proof that vapor can freeze.§§ 22–23 work as a synopsis for the next two main parts, naming so called “consideranda” for a better understanding or more thorough account of ice. To be considered are: “adiuncta”, “circumstantia temporis”, “duratio”, “locus ubi generatur”, “ex pendendi effectus”, “explorandus usus”, comparisons between ice and water).§§ 24–35 treat the mentioned “adiuncta”; these concomitant factors of ice are divided into the sub-aspects slipperiness (§§ 24–26), pellucidity (§§ 27–28), albedo (§ 29), hardness (§§ 30–31), degree of cold (§ 32), humidity (§ 33) and natural openings in ice (§ 34). In more detail: 
§§ 24–26 about “lubricitas”, roughly slipperiness, as a characteristic property of ice: Items touching ice easily slip, and this makes it hard to stand and/or walk on ice; iron spurs can be a remedy and are depicted, as well as sliding on knees; in general, caution is recommended when walking on ice.
§§ 27–28 about the “pelluciditas” (perluciditas) or “diaphaneitas” of ice: The absence of most of the aery particles (which are also translucent) in ice is no obstacle to its pellucidness, because water belongs to the translucent substances. In the freezing process, the dry particles are equally dispersed in the ice; this leads to a certain (uniform) cloudiness in the congelation of the element. In the melting process, the dry particles can be dispersed irregularly, what can cause “pelluciditas”, obscuration or cloudiness.
§ 29: Another characteristic of ice is its “albedo” (named “candor” in § 23), to be seen especially on its surface. It is caused by the concretion of water and by the aerial particles included in the (above mentioned) aerial bubbles.
§ 30–31 about the hardness (“durities”) of ice, which originates from the vehement “constrictio” of the humid [element] by the cold; another opinion is mentioned, namely that its hardness comes from the dryness of ice, but is not further explained. The author then writes, citing Cardanus, about the bearing capacity of ice, but doubts his observations as experience based. His conclusion is that the hardness depends from case to case.
§ 32 about the degree of cold (“frigus”) of ice: There is now doubt that ice is cold, being formed from cold water and surrounding cold, and it can also withstand a certain degree of warmth. This is due to the fact that even in ice there can be (restrained) warm particles, e.g., in “vino, quod congelatum quoque calidum esse non desinit” – however, the warmth cannot reveal its strength in frozen form, not being “sui iuris”, but “instar captivi compedibus constrictus”.
§ 33 about the humidity of ice: Ice melts, touched by warm hands; and humidity is an inseparable part of ice; the author refutes the opinion of his contemporary Fortinius Licetus, in whose opinion ice loses his humidity when “degenerating” into crystal. 
§ 34 about the “meatus”, natural openings in the ice. Whereas the popular opinion claims the wind to cause these openings, the author holds nature (“omni conatu a vacuo abhorrens”) responsible for the openings, offering two explanations: 1) aqueous particles volatilize into the air, while the waters surface is already frozen; this causes the openings [and avoids a vacuum?]; 2) nature defends some of the aqueous particles against the force of the cold – otherwise, because water first freezes on the outside, a vacuum might form.§§ 35–37: Next chapter of the “consideranda”: “circumstantia temporis”. Ice comes into being especially in winter times, when the water is cold enough to freeze. Given different climatic conditions, “hiems” is seen as quite a relative period (§ 35). Ice generates rather at night than in the daytime, e.g., in spring and autumn; “nocturnum frigus” also appears in milder climates (§ 36). Concerning ice in the summertime, the author distinguishes ice from salt (“aestiva glacies”) produced in marine salt fields, quoting Symposius’ term “mare sole concretum”: So not “frigus”, but “calor” works as catalyst. (§ 37)§§ 38–41: Next chapter of the “consideranda”: “duratio”. The “duratio” of ice depends on different factors, e.g., climate: Perpetual ice can be found in the northern regions, i.e., in the “glacialis Oceanus”, (references to: Pomponius Mela, Lucan, Juvenal, Pliny and a certain Bartholomaeus Barrientius, author of the “Annotationum Sylua”, publ. 1570). (§ 38). Elsewhere, when “frigus” is replaced by “calor” (=prime cause for melting), ice melts. The author points out that secondary causes have to be considered, citing the bible (Ps. 147,17–18): “He sends down ice like raindrops: water is made hard by his cold. At the outgoing of his word, the ice is turned to water; when he sends out his wind, there is a flowing of waters.” (§ 39). But experience shows that also cold (rain-)water can cause ice to liquefy, due to the condition of the humid element, which weakens and dissolves its concretion. (§ 40) Ice can be preserved under straw or hay layers: This is described as a process where the moderate “calor” of straw or hay does not resolve the ice, but, on the contrary, increases its “frigus”. (§ 41)§§ 42–44: Next chapter of the “consideranda”: “locus ubi generatur”. Generally speaking, ice can be generated in “illis terrae partibus” (…), “in quibus non occurdit quod impedimentum” (§ 42). Such obstacles might be the absence of “frigus”, e.g., in the equatorial region (“sub aequinoctiali”) (§ 43). The author believes it to be accurate (“cum ratione”) that in the polar regions there is no ice, due to the predominance of the “frigus”: Therefore, neither “terrae partes” nor “exhalationes calidae” can mix with the waters, which have already been mentioned as necessary “ad productionem glaciei” (§ 44).§ 45: A short chapter on the “considerandum” “effectus”: The author decides not to immerse into this subject, pointing to the previous sections (presumably the paragraphs identified as first main part) of the dissertation on the “conglaciation” and its various effects.§§ 46–54: Next –quite long – chapter of the “consideranda”: on various “usus” of ice; a certain influence by Dutch weather conditions is perceivable in §§ 52–54. The author rejects the imaginative opinions about ice being used as torture for the souls, about the entrance to the purgatory resp. to hell in Iceland, about sighing in the ice etc. (cf. Saxo Grammaticus, Olaus Magnus and Blesdikius) (§ 46). “Omissis fabulis”, the text secondly describes that ice was and is still used for cooling of beverages and especially wine, including some cross references (§ 47). The next paragraph contains a short deliberation about the assumed beneficial effects of drinking icy water (according to Avicenna); the author tends to agree with what Aulus Gellius ascribes to Aristotle, namely that “aquas in glacie vitiosas esse” (§ 48): Not only the “halitus terrei” (which contaminate molten ice) give proof of this assumption, but also the aerial “exhalationes” which sink and solidify onto immobile surface and thus cannot be ventilated away as they are in liquid water (§ 49). However, the following paragraph 50 contains certain exceptions, so that, under certain conditions, cold water nevertheless appears useful: 1) in warm regions and under warm weather conditions, 2) for those “calidissimi” by temperament or physical exercise, 3) if used moderately, 4) if one seeks the cold, 5) if one has quite a strong stomach! (§ 50). To summarize, the “first” usus of ice is its drinkability under certain conditions. 
Secondly, ice is walkable and might function as a bridge, but, due to its slipperiness, one should use certain tools to facilitate the passage (§ 51): These instruments, similar to climbing irons and skates, are described, including various cross references (§ 52), one short epigram by Hugo Grotius, a long elegy by Hadrianus Marius (“epistula de crepidis ferreis, quibus glacies percurritur” (§ 53). Thirdly, ice can function as a good driving surface for carriages, draught by animals, as well as tracks for sliding carriages on skids. (§ 54).§§ 55–58: The last chapter of the “consideranda” on comparisons between ice and water (§§ 55–58), stating some similarities and some differences. The similarity between ice and water has already been dealt with above, and it “consistit potissimum in frigore & colore (sic!)” – “colore” could be an error by the typesetter, whereas “calore” seems more probable, considering the authors deliberations in §§ 7–12; on the other hand, §§ 27–28 resp. § 29 deal with the pellucidness of ice, but these paragraphs only describe concomitant factors.
(§ 55). The following three paragraphs deal with differences between ice and water: Water does not share the qualities “hardness” and “humidity” with ice (§ 56). Unlike in water, fish might suffocate when staying longer “sub glacie”; this is seen as the reason why fish swim in droves to openings in the ice “magnoque numero a piscatoribus inde extrahi”. (§ 57).
The author concludes his dissertation, drawing the reader’s attention on the circular process of freezing water and melting ice: He quotes the riddles “mater me genuit, eadem mox gignitur ex me”, ascribed to Aelius Donatus, and “quam mater genuit, generavit filia matrem”.

The introduction discusses the etymology of snow and gives a definition of the aqueous form of precipitation (meteoron) (1-5); the text then turns to the Aristotelian causes (6-8), describes characteristics (adiuncta) of snow (9-30), e.g. color, durability, density, softness, temperature, motion, shape, characteristics of snowfall. The next section is on variouseffectusof snow (31-58), e.g. its effects on physical conditions (deteriorating effects on vision, provocation of nausea), its sound absorption quality, its contribution to fertility, its impact on water levels etc. The following section lists variousususof snow (59-66).

As in other disputations resp. dissertations, the publication ends with “corollaria respondentis”, suitable to prompt further discussion on philosophical and/or more general topics, e.g. “prona est divisio philosophiae in theoreticam et practicam” (1), “recte substantia dividitur in primam et secundam” (7).4) Poem by a friend:
At the very end, the reader finds one poem (15 elegiac couplets) by a certain I. Buchorst, dedicated to his friend, the respondens Van Stralen:Im Lichte der Dissertations-Tetrade (Reihenfolge: Eis, Schnee, Wasser, Winter) ist die vierzeilige, kursiv gesetzte, Einleitung von „de glacie“ (Vriesen) aufschlussreich: Es wird Wasser erwähnt, Eis als „hiemis adiunctum“ bezeichnet. 
In der dreizeiligen, ebenfalls kursiv gesetzten Einleitung zur Arbeit „de nive“ (Van Stralen) heißt es dazu passenderweise: „Cum nuper glaciem consideraverimus, non possumus non quoque dissertationem de nive subiicere. More autem solito a voce incipiemus.“Dazu passen die unvollständigen Datumsangaben auf den Titelblättern, die eine zeitliche Abfolge und ein dahinterstehendes Konzept suggerieren:“De Glacie” (Vriesen) datiert wie folgt: Ad diem ___ Martii horis locoque solitis. 
“De Nive” (Vriesen) datiert wie folgt: Ad diem ___ (Leerstelle) horis locoque solitis. 
(Entweder beide zeitgleich im März, oder in monatlicher Abfolge; man beachte, dass auf beiden Titelblättern Satzfehler zu finden sind: „De glacie“ mit „Om(lan)dica“, „De nive“ ohne Monatsangabe.) 
„De aqua“ (Wittichius) datiert wie folgt: Ad diem ___ Maii horis locoque solitis.

Ex physicis disputationem publicam de nive in electorali ad Albim academia sub praesidio magistri Georgii Caspari Kirchmaieri placidae eruditorum disquisitioni sistet respondens Martinus Leutmann, Teutoprona Ungarus, ad diem 12 Novembris anno orbis redempti MDCLIX horis locoque consuetis",,1659,Wittenberg,Oelschlägel,17th century,Dissertation,Meteorology/Earth sciences,Disputatio publica de nive(SUB Göttingen),694618,"ThePublic Dissertation on Snowwas printed 1659 in Wittenberg; the title page names the polymath Georg Kaspar Kirchmaier (1635–1700) aspraesesand a certain Martin Leutmann asrespondens. Their written contributions to the 14 page dissertation are unclear, as are biographical details on Leutmann. Only the adjectiveTeutoprona(on the title page) most likely refers to Leutmanns provenance, the village Nitrianske Pravno (once Deutsch-Proben, Slovakia, latinized Teutoprona), and the concluding paratext indicates a friendship between the two.The text itself is divided into three sections, i.e.a long section 1 (dogmatica) (pp.1-8): This section deals with the common deliberations on the etymology of snow, itsgenera, itsgeneratioand delimitations, closely followed by the classification according to the four Aristotelian causes and the listing of concomitant phenomena (incommoditates, locus, tempus);a shorter section 2 (porismatica) (pp. 8-9): The text lists different observations on snow, e.g. that the cold lessens before snowfall, that clouds become white before the snowfall starts, also that worms can emerge from snow;section 3 (elenctica) (pp. 10-13): The text discusses twodubiaon snow, i.e. a) whether it is really white or does only appear so (albedo) and b) for what reasons snowflakes are sexangular.As section 1 indicates, the dissertation follows conventional Aristotelian lines of thought, whereas the text, in sections 2 and 3, also considers more recent deliberations by contemporary scholars (e.g., Kepler, Froidmont, Sperling). In doing so, the dissertation is a good example for the diversity within the dissertation genre.In terms of language and style, the text is carefully elaborated. This observation especially applies for theeisodion, where the author attempts a similar wordplay to the one Kepler did in 1611 (cf. the consonance ofnixand Germannichtsin KeplersDe nive sexangula), stating it as abonum factumthatnix vile nomen viliori gaudet aestimatione.",,"Leutmann, Martin‎(← links)De figura nivis dissertatio‎(← links)Kirchmaier, Georg Kaspar‎(← links)De nive dissertatio secunda‎(← links)De nive dissertatio quarta‎(← links)Observationes philologicae de nive‎(← links)","Kirchmaier, Georg Kaspar; Leutmann, Martin:Disputatio publica de nive, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disputatio_publica_de_nive(last revision: 12.01.2022).","Introduction:In the short (1/2 page) introductory section, the text attempts a similar wordplay to the one Kepler did in 1611 (cf. the consonance ofnixand “nichts” in KeplersDe nive sexangula, stating it as abonum factumthatnix vile nomen viliori gaudet aestimatione. The text then mentions the hexagonal shape of snowflakes (cf. Kepler 1611); it uses Ciceroshic aqua haeret” (off. 3,117) to inform the reader that the cause for their formation remains obscure. Citing from Johann SperlingsInstiutiones physicae(chapterDe meteoribus aqueis, who also says that the reasons for their formation remain indistinct), the author turns to the snowflakes’materia, which should be, due to theircandor, asamabilisas ivory, cotton, paper, wool.(N. B.: The quoted Johann Sperling died 1658, i. e. shortly before the dissertation was printed).The main part is divided into three sections.First section /Dogmatica:
Namedsectio dogmatica, this section presents differenttheoremataon snow and examines other opinions; one might note the division into paragraphs.Theorema 1: 
The first theorem titlesnixas a meteorological phenomenone nube condensata; before it melts into rain, it falls to the ground like carded wool. 
§ 1Etymologica; The author names different etymological opinions on snow, among them  Apuleius, Isidor, Scaliger; the text invites the lector to decide freelyquod verum est:datur optio cuique.
§ 2Genera nivis: The author distinguishes between two genera of snow, appearing in different altitudes, and states a circular process of creating and melting. Thegenus nivis remotumbelongs to the meteora, appears as snow and is to find in themedia aeris regione; thegenus nivis proximumbelongs to the aquatic phenomena, appears as rain and is hence to find in theinfima aeris regione. 
§ 3: The paragraph firstly provides descriptions of how snow is created (Plinius, Froidmont 1627, Scaliger); secondly, the author aims to bring together Froidmonts and Scaligers positions: Snow is similar to spray – they are both white, airy, both volatilize after a certain period of time, both are water, but in different states of aggregation.
§ 4: The author distinguishes snow from frost and dew; he claims Cardanus’ definition to be inaccurate.Theorema 2: 
The text now discusses different aspects of snow:
§§ 1–6 observe the circular process of creation andfinisof snow, §§ 7–8 describeincommoditatesand side effects of snow, §§ 9–11 are dedicated to weather conditions, places, seasons concerning snow.
A more detailed overview:
§ 1:Efficiens nivis, universalis prima, Deus est.– Aside from god, the heavens (sidera) are responsible for snow assecunda causa, i. e., e. g., the sun ascaloris princeps, the moon ashumorum dominaetc., but they influence snow(ing)contactu quidem non corporali. For the author, not everything is understandable, namely due tooccultas qualitates et influentias arcanas). A third (particularis,instrumentalis) cause for the generation of snow isaere frigus: by affecting (invadit,occupat,stringit) clouds the cold causes the falling of snowflakes; this is seen as a step by step process rather than as a singular act.
§ 2:Materia: The major constituent of snow is water, but snow partially consists of air and earth, somewhat of warm exhalation (vapor). The earthen parts can be observed as turbidities in the snowmelt; proof for the aerial parts is that snow is light and can drift away, the warm exhalation can be observed when snow melts much harder than hail (which possesses lessvapor).
§ 3:Forma: This section provides informations about the sexangular shape and different sizes of snowflakes, including a quotation from Descartes’Meteora(a few lines on snowflakes and on hail), whose opinion is shared.
§ 4: On the cause for snowfall: The author quotes again from Descartes’Meteora, but is not satisfied with Descartes’ explanation who claims the winds to be responsible for snowfall. Instead the author states:Plus millies nix cadit, vento tamen praesente nullo.§ 5:Finis1 – Snow leads to the fertility of the ground and irrigates the soil: The author refers to the bible and Scaliger.
§ 6:Finis2 – Snow might also protect crops (frugum incolumitas) and contributes to fertility; the author quotes Pliny, Scaliger, Froidmont.
§ 7:Incommoditates– Bulimy (incl. etymological explanation) is described as a side effect of snow.
§ 8: Other side effects: The paragraph identifies, following Froidmont,meteorosensitivegroups, such assenes, studiosi, cararrhosiwho suffer from certain side effects (cold, aches, other symptoms), even might go blind (this applies also to hen); snowfall has also sound deadening side effects.
§ 9: On thelocus nivium generandarumis usually themedia aeris regio, rarely the lower regions. Episode reported by a certain Zabarella, presumably Jacopo Zabarella, who climbed a mountain and discoveredin inferiori parte ingentem pluviam, cum in montis vertice non pluisset.§ 10: On earth, snowfall can happen in different places: According to Pliny not on the high seas, notsub aequatore, not in Aaethiopia (according to Bodinus, Froidmont resp. Girolamo Fracastoro, Alvarez). The dissertation refers to Seneca (de pleno Nilo) instead and rejects the mentioned position:Morale est: qui facile credit, decipitur facile.– Places where snowfall happens are named (incl. liter. testimonies): Causasus, Alps, northern regions.
§ 11: On the seasons: Snow forms especially in winter, and its formation generally depends on the temperature conditions; this may be different in some regions. Theduratioof snow also varies: a few days, months, even all year long (in valleys between mountain peaks).Second section /Porismatica:This short section formulates apparently minor observations (here namedporismata).
Porisma 1 is titledsignae futuris nivis varia.
§ 1: The cold lessens before snowfall, this is because the warm air, bound in the clouds, is turned downward. If it is too cold, it cannot snow: “Es kann vor Kälte nicht schneyen.” – The winds also contribute to the snowfall.
§ 2: Clouds become white. Some (catarrhosi, senes, phlegmatici … clinici, valetudinarii) are affected by headaches and other symptoms. Skilled astrologers can predict snowfalls – years in advance – by observing the planetary constellations. According to the author, it might be unwise (temerarius) to further discuss the latter.Porisma 2is titledvermiculos in nivibus prognasci posse nec falsum nec absurdumAccording to Aristoteles, Strabo, Scaliger, Bartholin, Cardanus, worms can begin their life in snow. In the second paragraph, the author agrees, names examples, finally stating thatnix vermiculorum materia non ex qua, sed in qua.Third section:Elenctica:
By using the philosophicalterminus tecnicus(elenchos) for continuative questioning (of previous results), thissectiodeals with twodubiawhich are further discussed:Dubium 1: Whether snow is white. This section contains fourparagraphos, presents primarily the opinions of Libert Froidmont 1627 (Meteorologicorum libri sex. Antwerpen), Erasmus Bartholin 1661 (De figura nivis dissertatio. Kopenhagen), Sperling 1658 (cf. above); it also deals with the state(s) of aggregation.Dubium 2: For what reasons snow is sexangular? This section contains three paragraphs, it presents primarily the opinions of Kepler 1611 (cf. above), Descartes 1637 (Les Météores. Leiden) and Sperling 1658 (cf. above).Critical acclaim / Poem by thepraeses, dedicated to Leutmann:
The dissertation is concluded with a short poem by thepraeses, dedicated to Leutmann. The five strophes describe Leutmann as ingenious and eager scholar, and Kirchmaier wishes his student a fruitful future.

Pico started to work on theDisputationesin 1493 but the work was never completed to the author's sudden death in 1494. The treatise was published posthumously in 1496 by Pico's nephew Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola. Since then the work has sometimes been suspected to be a forgery, although there is no firm evidence to confirm this assumption. In the preface, Pico differentiates two types of astrology: mathematical, that is astronomy, which is considered a useful tool in astronomical observations, and judicial astrology, whose adepts intend to predict the future. Throughout the treatise Pico demonstrates that astrology has no natural philosophical and scientific grounds, and is embroiled in numerous contradictions and inconsistencies within itself.After its publication, the work provoked large-scale discussions on the status of astrology in Italy and across Europe, which resulted in numerous pro- and anti-responses.",Pico della Mirandola 2004(modern edition)Vanden Broecke 2003Bertozzi 2008Westman 2011,"Pico della Mirandola, Giovanni‎(← links)Commentarii in centum Claudii Ptolemaei sententias‎(← links)De falsa diluvii prognosticatione‎(← links)De rebus coelestibus‎(← links)Non-entia chymica‎(← links)Apotelesmata astrologiae Christianae‎(← links)","Pico della Mirandola, Giovanni:Disputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disputationes_adversus_astrologiam_divinatricem(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,,Yes,OA,

(Indeed, in view of the high prices and correspondingly small quantities of the respective substances, as well as the difficulty of their chemical resolution, to design telling experiments and procure or produce the respective instruments must have constituted no small challenge.) Regarding the acids used as solvents, for instance, Bergman prescribes the following (p. 147):Reliqua acida itidem destillatione sunt depuranda, nam in primis est necessarium, ut omni inquinamento terreo vel metallico sint liberata, quippe quod et qualitatem et quantitatem principiorum analysi eruendorum confundit.The other acids have to be purified by distillation as well, for it is absolutely mandatory for them to be free of any contamination with earthlike substances or metals since this muddles the quality and amount of the elements which should be found out by the analysis.The paper's late date, technical content, and 'scientific' print image (some footnotes, calculations in the text, a simple table on p. 155) are matched by its terminology. Expressions likemenstruumfor ""solvent"" or the abovementionedtubus ferruminatoriuspresumably were beyond the linguistic competence of the average reader then as now.

In particular, Gauss's systematic research on congruences – the relationship between two or more integers sharing the same remainder if divided by another integer –  was to prove immensely fruitful.TheDisquisitionesare divided into seven sections, of which the first four partly contain results already published byFermat,Euler, Lagrange and Legendre (but obtained independently by the young Gauss), while the remaining three mainly comprise new results. Section I introduces the fundamentals of modular arithmetic, section II, linear congruences, and section III, congruences of powers, which lead up to the first proof of the so-called ""law of quadratic reciprocity"" given in section IV. This statement on the existence of square roots modulo prime numbers had been previously conjectured by Euler. Section V, which nearly covers half of the whole book, deals with (mostly binary) quadratic forms discussing questions of representability of numbers by a quadratic form, of equivalence of forms, and of their composition. Gauss introduces operations on classes of quadratic forms and ""reckons"" with these abstract, non-numerical objects, a groundbreaking idea. Section VI presents various applications of the results obtained so far. The last section is dedicated to the equationxn=1, yielding the equal division of the unit circle in the complex plane by thencomplex roots of unity (which is later called ""cyclotomy""). Gauss's reduction method to lower degree equations surprisingly answers a geometric question: which regular polygons are constructible by compass and straightedge only? Apart from this Gauss also gives a prime factorization theorem for the set of complex numbers with integer coefficients (later called ""Gaussian integers"").Below the level of the sections, theDisquisitionesare structured in 366 shorter numbered paragraphs, each of which is dedicated to one specific problem, theorem or example.The body text is preceded by a letter of thanks to the dedicatee, a preface to the reader, which defines the work's place in the framework of mathematics as a whole, details its genesis and justifies its structure (sections I–IV are left in place because they assemble material that is otherwise dispersed in journal articles, also contain some new material and are indispensable for the understanding of sections V–VII, a planned section VIII had to be omitted due to its expected length) and a detailed table of contents. At the end, one finds a few last-minute additions, some tables and a long list of errata (caused by the intricacies of the mathematical notation).Around 1800, the mathematical notation already was well-developed and in many respects corresponded to our present one. Gauss contributed to its development himself by the introduction of the symbol for ""is congruent to"" – three horizontal strokes, because of the analogies between the relation of congruence and the relation of equality. Nonetheless, theDisquisitionespresent themselves not as a continuous string of formulas, they still are very much a text to be read in the ordinary sense of the word. Furthermore, the notions and results are developed and explained in an almost didactical manner: Gauss explicates his approaches and guides the reader through definitions and results by giving outlooks and illuminative examples.Gauss writes a Latin of exemplary clarity and sometimes beauty. This is most obvious in the preface, where he for instance describes his experience of being drug into mathematics as a young autodidact in moving words (pp. IX–X):Scilicet in alio forte labore tunc occupatus, casu incidi in eximiam quandam veritatem arithmeticam (fuit autem, ni fallor, theorema art. 108), quam cum et per se pulcherrimam aestimarem et cum maioribus connexam esse suspicarer, summa qua potui contentione in id incubui, ut principia quibus inniteretur perspicerer demonstrationemque rigorosam nanciscerer. Quod postquam tandem ex voto successisset, illecebris harum quaestionum ita fui implicatus, ut eas deserere non potuerim. Quo pacto, dum alia semper ad alia viam sternebant …While engaged in another work, I came by chance across an extraordinary arithmetic truth – if I remember correctly, it was theorem nr. 108 – and since I found it most beautiful in itself and suspected it to be connected to things of even greater importance, I made the greatest possible effort to understand the principles on which it was based and to find a cogent proof for it. After I had achieved this according to my wishes, I found myself so entangled by the charms of these questions that I could not let go of them. In this way, one thing always paved the way to another …The mathematical clarity of Gauss's style may be exemplified by his introduction of the notion of congruence in the work's very first sentences:Si numerus a numerorum b, c differentiam metitur, b et c secundum a congrui dicuntur, sin minus, incongrui; ipsum a modulum appellamus. Uterque numerorum b, c priori in casu alterius residuum, in posteriori vero nonresiduum vocatur.If the number a measures [i.e. is a divider of] the difference between b and c, b and c are called congruent with respect to a, otherwise, they are called incongruent; a itself we call their modulus [i.e. measure]. In the former case, we call either of the numbers b and c the residue of the other, in the latter, its non-residue.The work's immediate impact is demonstrated, among other things, by A.C.M. Poullet-Delisle's French translation, which was published as early as 1807. But not only immediate success made this book one of the milestones of mathematics. It influenced E. Galois and H. Abel in their final (negative) answer to the question of solvability of algebraic equations of higher degrees; and not least, its notions and concepts paved the way for modern abstract algebra and number theory.","Clarke 1966Grattan-Guinness 2005, 303–15Brüning 2006","Gauß, Carl Friedrich‎(← links)","Gauß, Carl Friedrich:Disquisitiones arithmeticae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disquisitiones_arithmeticae(last revision: 21.02.2022).",The ed. owned by the LBI ist Clarke 1966.Changed Gauß to Gauss (standard in English),MK,Yes,"DB, MK, FB",

J. 1902)",835250,"In theInvestigations about Curved Surfaces in General, a rather short work of c. 50 pages, Gauss made fundamental contributions to differential geometry, i.e., the study of smooth, curved surfaces with the help of the calculus.WhereasEuler, Meusnier, Monge and others had dedicated themselves to the study of smooth curves and surfaces already in the late 18th century, Gauss developed the idea of ""intrinsic geometry"" of surfaces, a very fruitful idea for (differential) geometry of the 19th century. Inspired by his surveying tasks he was the first one to consider a geometry on a sphere (or any other smooth surface)independently of a surrounding space. In such geometries theparallel postulateneed not hold (e.g. on the sphere), a circumstance Gauss was certainly aware of but did not explicitly comment on.After the titlepage, the book starts rightaway with the first paragraphs which contain definitions and notions concerning curves and surfaces in differential geometry. In paragraph 6 he introduces total curvature (later called Gaussian curvature), the central notion of the work. The following paragraphs are dedicated to various formulas how to express the Gaussian curvature, in particular the result that it can be expressed as the product of Euler's extreme radii of curvature. In paragraph 12, one finds thetheorema egregium, as Gauss himself proudly calls it. It says:Si superficies curva in quamcumque aliam superficiem explicatur, mensura curvaturae in singulis punctis invariata manet.(""If a curved surface is a development of any other surface, the measure of the curvature remains unchanged in every single point."") This means a Gaussian curvature of a given surface remains unchanged if one can wrap a surface on another without distortions. 
The next paragraphs treat geodesics, a generalisation of straight lines, generalisations of circles, and geodesics of fixed distances on arbitrary surfaces. Finally, Gauss comes to triangulation and measurement of generalised triangles. With their help, the Gaussian curvature can also be obtained by measuring the angles, distances, and their rates. These measurements can be performed within the surface and without a regress to an embedding into three-dimensional space. The last paragraph is on an application of the results to geodesy, the main inspiration for the previous considerations.Style and layout of theDisquisitionesare almost indistinguishible from modern mathematical papers (up to the usage of computers). Shorter formulas are printed in-line, longer or more space-consuming ones on separate ""math lines""; theorems are rendered in italics. Tedious details of standard calculations are omitted but a learned reader can nevertheless follow the exposition which is nicely rounded off by explanations and applications.The work was presented in 1827 to the Royal Society of Göttingen and published in Latin in theirCommentationes Societatis Regiae Scientiarum Gottingensis Recentioresthe same year. Already one year later, the almost identical work appeared as a small book. The printer, ""Dieterichsche Buchhandlung"", only had to add a title page and change the page numbering, so that the book was soon printed. Translations to French, German, Russian, Hungarian and English (see link above) were published between 1852 and 1902 and underline the interest of the mathematical community in Gauss's paper.","Clarke 1966Scriba; Schreiber 2005, 408–415Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 5, 304","Gauß, Carl Friedrich‎(← links)Appendix scientiam spatii absolute veram exhibens‎(← links)","Gauß, Carl Friedrich:Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disquisitiones_generales_circa_superficies_curvas(last revision: 02.12.2021).",,FB,Yes,"DB, FB",

Locher dedicated the print to Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria. The text is preceded by one panegyric poem written by the respondent's brother, two others follow at the end of the work. A letter to the reader of several pages praises the usefulness of mathematics for numerous academic disciplines, military tactics, agriculture, and more. Apart from these paratexts, the work was most probably written by Scheiner and only defended by Locher, as was customary for university dissertations at the time. This is also supported by the fact that Scheiner called the work ""myDisquisitions"" in letters to bothGalileo GalileiandPierre Gassendi(Bianchi 1999).The propositions begin with general thoughts on the discipline of mathematics, about its subfields, such as arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, astronomy and astrology, etc., or about how mathematical conclusions are found and in what way they are presented. With proposition eight, the text turns to astronomy, which is the focus of the whole work. Different world systems are presented and reviewed, with the help of theoretical demonstration or experiments. The author starts with the Ptolemaic system, which is rejected as well as other ancient and medieval theories about the heavens, i.a. the question of the supposed infiniteness and eternity of the universe (which is negated with the aid of dubious mathematical ""proofs"" on the non-existence of infinite space). TheCopernicansystem is presented early on but rejected on the basis of physical arguments.Tycho Braheis cited and used as the most important authority.  After theCopernican, the world system ofGirolamo Fracastoro'sHomocentricais introduced as well asChristoph Clavius', before turning to and discussing in more detail the hybrid system of Tycho Brahe. Furthermore, the appearance and motion of the sun, the moon, and the planets Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn are exposed.  Among other things, the work presents recent discoveries made thanks to the invention of the telescope, such as the surface of the moon andsunspots. It includes inter alia one of the first maps of the moon.The work is divided into 44 chapters, but a great variety of additional subtitles of all kinds results in a quite complex structure in which orientation is not easy for the reader. Nonetheless, the discussion of many of the topics features a similar structure: the issue is first introduced, and ancient and contemporary authorities, as well as prerequisite knowledge about the topic at hand, are presented; then questions resulting from this issue are asked. This is followed by the author's argument and his conclusions as well as assertions based on this reasoning. Besides ancient, medieval, and contemporary authorities, empirical investigation and experiments play an important role in the author's reasoning.  The argument is in many cases supported by intricate illustrations.Despite being formally a university dissertation, theDisquisitioneswere widely read. Among the most prominent, and most critical, readers, was Galileo Galilei, to whom Scheiner sent a copy in 1615 and who dismissed most of Scheiner's arguments in his ownDialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo(1632).","Bianchi 1999Graney 2015, 64–66Graney 2017(translation)","Scheiner, Christoph‎(← links)Locher, Johann Georg‎(← links)","Scheiner, Christoph; Locher, Johann Georg:Disquisitiones mathematicae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Disquisitiones_mathematicae(last revision: 22.11.2021).","Graney seems under the impression that Locher, who is not know otherwise, as far as I (JL) can see, is the author of this dissertation.

As in many early modern dissertations, it is difficult to ascertain who actually wrote the text. Some collaboration between thepraesesPetrus Ekerman and the student Andreas Piscator appears probable, since the former held a chair of rhetoric at Uppsala, while the latter seems to be the speaker of the personal words on his love of mathematics in the first paragraph (Bohlin 2015, 11). The public dimension of the whole enterprise  shows in Piscator's opening letter of dedication to his patron, the mine owner Leonhard Lennartsson, and in a congratulatory note in Swedish at the end by one of his colleagues, Johannes Christianus Welin.The text of the dissertation comprises nine quarto pages, divided into eight paragraphs. The Latin is polished, yet easy to read. The author(s) obviously strive(s) to demonstrate his/their perfect command of the language. Quotations are given in italics in the text and identified in a total of 14 notes at the end of the single paragraphs. The text starts from the identification of a research gap: Despite Cicero's enormous popularity, his mathematical knowings have never been studied in depth (§ I). Next, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is explained (because Cicero was more interested in the latter, for example in astronomy; § II). An overview of Cicero's course of education shows that he had ample opportunity to learn a good deal of mathematics (§§ III–V). His works – the translation of Aratus'Phenomenaand some philosophical dialogues – are scrutinised for traces of mathematical knowledge (§§ VI–VIII). From all of this, it is apparent that Cicero was a skilled mathematician, a thesis corroborated by a couple of pertinent quotations from Tacitus, Quintilian andRamus(§ VIII).In fact, however, the argumentation fails to convince for the simple reason that the actual allusions to mathematical topics in Cicero's works are few and trivial. Today, the dissertation is of interest mainly as an extreme example of the close link between the humanities and the natural sciences that still persisted in the mid-18th century: From a modern perspective, it is difficult to find two disciplines less connected between them than rhetoric and mathematics. Perhaps for this reason, theAcademic Dissertation on Cicero as a Mathematicianis among the few early modern dissertations that have received a proper scholarly edition in recent years (Bohlin 2015).",Bohlin 2015,"Ekerman, Petrus‎(← links)Piscator, Andreas‎(← links)","Ekerman, Petrus; Piscator, Andreas:Dissertatio academica de Cicerone mathematico, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_academica_de_Cicerone_mathematico(last revision: 16.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Cum privilegio imperatorio.",,1610,Prague,Sedlčanský,17th century,"Letter, Other (see description), Review","Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography",Dissertatio cum nuntio sidereo(Google Books),657723,"The circumstances of the composition and publication of Kepler'sConversation with the Messenger from the Starsare detailed in the letter of dedication to Giuliano de' Medici, Tuscan embassador to the Holy Roman Empire from 1608 to 1618. When theSidereus nuntiuswas published in March 1610, Galilei sent Kepler a personal copy through Giuliano and asked for his opinion. Kepler received the copy and was informed about the request on April 8 and 13 respectively. Although he had less than a week before the official couriers would return to Tuscany on April 19, he to penned a long letter to Galilei and had it dispatched on time. A few weeks later, he published a slightly revised version of the letter at Prague. The booklet, which comprised some 40 quarto pages, was introduced by the aforementioned dedication and a preface to the reader. A postscript was also added which made short shrift of two other alleged mathematical and astronomical sensations announced for the upcoming Frankfurt book fair. Two unauthorised reprints of theConversationappeared the same year in Florence and the next one in Frankfurt.In terms of literary genre, Kepler's work is unique. Formally speaking, it fulfils the criteria for being a letter, featuring an initial salutation as well as the date and a valediction at the end. The numerous direct addresses to Galilei in the body of the text are in the style of a letter as well. Regarding structure and content, by contrast, the text may be called a reviewavant la lettreand a free commentary on Galilei's book. Similar books about recently published works are nothing unusual at the time in principle, but most of them are polemical, which theConversationis not.After an introduction and an exposition of his reasons to trust Galilei's report in principle, Kepler discusses the different issues brought up in theMessengerin the order in which they appear there: the telescope, the lunar observations, the sizes of stars and planets, the milky way, the four moons of Jupiter. In each section, however, the summary of Galilei's observations makes up but a small part of Kepler's account. The better part is taken up by his own optical, astronomical, cosmological and theological associations and reflections. Throughout his letter, Kepler connects Galilei's material to his own thinking and develops it in sometimes surprising directions. In doing so, he deploys astonishing acumen, learning, subtlety and powers of imagination.Kepler misses no opportunity to praise and honour Galilei for his achievements and even openly confesses that some of his own views have been refuted by the Italian (e.g. p. 21, on the earthshine). He clearly does not want to come across as being jealous of his great colleague. There is no need to doubt the sincerity of his trust in Galilei, his admiration for him and his intention to act as hisproaspistes(p. 4), that is, to shield him in his battle against his critics. At the same time, however, Kepler time and again tries to show how Galilei's discoveries fit his own theories and how much this theoretical framework adds to their importance. In order to bolster his respective arguments, he often refers Galilei to his own books, for instance to theMysterium cosmographicum(1597) or theAstronomiae pars optica(1604), so that his and Galilei's roles appear to be temporarily reversed: Now, it is Galilei who should read Kepler and learn from him. (It may be no accident that at the beginning of the letter, p. 1, Kepler depicts himself imagining how Galilei would read his recently publishedAstronomia nova.) Overall, Kepler seems to dream of a collaboration in which Galilei would provide new astronomical observations (something Kepler is unable to do due to his poor eyesight and his lack of a telescope, e.g. p. 4) and Kepler would make sense of them; in other words, Galilei would become something like Kepler's new Brahe. In any case, Kepler subtly but decidedly assures that his own achievements are not overshadowed by Galilei's sensational observations. That he figures asmathematicus Caesareus(""imperial astronomer"") on his title page, while Galilei is only amathematicus Patavinus(""astronomer from [the University of] Padua""), becomes pointed in this light.In terms of style, Kepler is as lively and splendid as ever despite the hurry in which theConversationwas composed and rushed into print. To quote just one example: The moment when Kepler learns from his friend Johannes Matthaeus Wacker von Wackenfels that Galilei has discovered four new planets (they will turn out to be moons of Jupiter, but right now seem to ruin Kepler's contention, never believed by Wackenfels, that there can be six planets only) is narrated with captivating verve, realism and immediacy (pp. 1–2):… tanta me incessit admiratio absurdissimi acroamatis consideratione, tanti orti animorum motus (quippe ex inopinato decisa antiqua inter nos liticula), ut ille gaudio, ego rubore, risu uterque ob novitatem confusi, ille narrando, ego audiendo vix sufficeremus.… as I realised what bizarre things I had heard, I was seized by such wonder and our feelings were stirred up so strongly (since this small, but longstanding dispute between us had unexpectedly been decided) that Wackenfels was baffled by joy, I, by red shame, both of us, by laughter in view of this surprise, and that he was hardly able to tell and I to listen.TheConversationis a short masterpiece whose intellectual and literary richness cannot be done justice here. Luckily, it also is one of few Neo-Latin works of natural science to have been graced with an excellent commentary, the one accompanying the translation byRosen 1965. Rosen's book is highly recommended for further study.","Caspar et al. 1938ff., vol. 4, 281–311 (edition of the Latin text);Rosen 1965(English translation with short introduction and commentary)","Sidereus nuntius‎(← links)Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes:Dissertatio cum nuntio sidereo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_cum_nuntio_sidereo(last revision: 03.05.2021).","RECENSIODissertatioin the title is strange, because it usually cannot mean ""conversation"".Interestingly, theDissertatiowas read as veiled criticism of Galileo immediately after its publication by Georg Fugger – something vigorously contradicted by Rosen 1965, xviii–xix.

(On a similar occasion, theDissertatio de salubritate aquaewas presented by Johann Karl Anton Gerstner.)

The text is not directed to fellow physicians, but to the learned man (the potential patient) himself. Consequently, the author shows himself especially conscious of literary style, apologizing for stylistic faults (Nulla enim mihi aurium, sed animi cura est, fol. a3r).

With thisDissertation on Drunkenness, the later ship's doctor and pioneer of nautical medicine Thomas Trotter gained his doctoral degree in medicine. As shown by the indexes to Johann Carl Heffter'sMuseum disputatorium physico-medicum, he had chosen a subject that was generally popular in dissertations. Within the history of the genre, the work represents an already largely modern stage, as it was written by the student himself, not thepraesesor anybody else, and was seen as an important part of the accomplishments required for the doctoral degree. All of this is implied by Trotter himself, who writes on p. 10:Igitur mihi coronam medicam ambiunti mecum putavi operae pretium esse quaedam ex scriptis medicorum colligere et pauca ex meo proprio penu addere de ebrietate eiusque effectibus in corpus humanum.So when I aspired to the crown of medicine, I thought by myself that it would be worthwhile to collect certain statements from the writings of doctors and to add a little from my own stock concerning drunkenness and its effects on the human body.Unfortunately, no complete copy of the work could be found. The one shown here is shorn of the introductory paratexts. The short main text (36 sparsely printed quarto pages) starts from aprooemium(pp. 9–11), which is followed by five chapters. The first (pp. 12–13) definesebrietas. The next (pp. 14–19) describes its symptoms. Chapter 3 (pp. 20–22) identifies its immediate cause (causa proxima), the stimulating power of alcohol. Chapter 4 (pp. 23–34) is dedicated to diseases caused by alcohol; it is divided into two sections, which discuss the noxious effects of momentary drunkenness and chronic alcoholism respectively. In the final chapter (pp. 35–44), prophylactic and therapeutic measures are discussed.As can be seen from this summary, the work is well-structured. As announced in the passage quoted above, Trotter combines references to earlier medical work on the subject, mostly in the form of footnotes, with case histories adduced from his own experience (he had already practiced several years as a ship surgeon before his studies at Edinburgh). To illustrate that intoxication can cause convulsions, for instance, he narrates the story of two of his colleagues in the Royal Navy to whom this happened regularly; one ultimately went overboard and drowned (In tali paroxysmo alter ex nave cecidit et in undas[sic]periit, p. 26).Trotter spices his dissertation up with passages from classical and English poetry, which he quotes in the text itself and in footnotes. His Latin, however, seems to have been somewhat shaky. The error in the case history just mentioned, where he confounds an ablative of place with an accusative of direction, is no isolated case. On p. 25,ascribo(""to attribute"") is constructed with the prepositionadinstead of a simple dative, and the meaning of the expressionsolidum vivum(""firm alive"", p. 22) is altogether elusive. This apparently did not bother the medical professors at Edinburgh who nonetheless awarded Trotter his doctoral degree.A much-expanded English version of the work appeared in 1804 under the titleAn Essay, Medical, Philosophical, and Chemical, on Drunkenness, and Its Effects on the Human Body. This book became quite popular, went through several editions, was translated into German, and is still cited as an early classic on alcoholism.",,,"Trotter, Thomas:Dissertatio de ebrietate, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_de_ebrietate(last revision: 02.03.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It is divided into 18 short paragraphs. The beginning states the still ominous character of magnets and magnetism, which inspires wonder in many people, its secrets still largely unknown to humanity. Then, the basic characteristics of a magnet are presented: 1) it attracts other magnets, iron, steel etc.; 2) it points toward the North and South pole, but not without a slight declination; and 3) it can transmit this last characteristic also to iron and other substances. Experiments conducted by earlier scholars are presented, e.g.Petrus Peregrinus,William GilbertorRobert Boyle, concerning i.a. attraction and repulsion, or the characteristics of the magneticeffluvia, which were considered the way of transporting magnetic power, flowing between magnet and objects in their vicinity.Other paragraphs are discussing the possibilities of strengthening or weakening a magnet and the different opinions on the origin of magnetism – the earth, the heaven, the pole star, or obscure forces. The authors are doubtful about the earth as cause, an opinion first advocated by Gilbert, as it had not been fully explained yet, but also about heavenly phenomena as the ultimate cause. They go on to explain that since most magnets contain sulphur, this could be the origin of magneticeffluvia, and discuss the possibility of imitating nature by producing iron magnets. The dissertation is followed by nine colloraries dealing with chemistry, medicine, and general morals, which were probably meant as additional material to be discussed during thedisputatio.
The language of the short dissertation is, quite appropriately for the genre, technical, the style simple. Occasionally, phenomena or termini are explained with an additional German note in brackets within the text.

TheDissertatio de magnetepresents, on 47 pages and in 60 short paragraphs, Euler's hypotheses on the origin of magnetism, which was still a highly controversial topic at the time. Based on Cartesian ideas, Euler sees a very thin and delicate matter (materia subtilis) as a cause for magnetic power. This matter, which had been calledaetherby Descartes and others, is because of its special characteristics able to access very thin openings within magnetic materials, a process which is invisible to the human eye. These valves within magnets then orient themselves in parallel lines. Once themateria subtilisreaches the other end of the magnet, it is however obstructed by the surrounding aether, deflected towards the other end of the magnet and the openings of its valves again. This way, an aether-vortex is created, which can be made visible for the human eye by placing iron shavings in the vicinity of the magnet.Euler also explains magnetic variation as a result of the earth's rotation, as this results in a daily change of the effects of aether, of the valves within magnets, of the magnetic poles and, in consequence, in variation in compasses, which increases the farther from the pole they are. Among other topics discussed is e.g. the artificial magnetization and de-magnetization of iron. 
Euler relays his theory of magnetism in a technical, classicizing Latin, using as methods mostly demonstration and a number of qualitative experiments, aided by 19 figures appended on the last page.",Speiser 1983,"Dissertatio pro praemio de ratione motus‎(← links)Euler, Leonhard‎(← links)","Euler, Leonhard:Dissertatio de magnete (Euler), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_de_magnete_(Euler)(last revision: 13.12.2021).",,JL,Yes,JL,

The dissertation reveals Bošković's selective approach to the sources, typical for the genre in general. As a classical scholar engaged with the history of science, he pays particular attention to ancient texts concerned with the phenomenon, at the same time completely omitting everything between Pliny the Elder and sixteenth-century natural philosophers. Thus, he remains silent on the most widespread interpretation, which dated back to Persian astrologer Abu Ma'shar's famousLiber introductorii maioris ad scientiam astrorumand determines the whole discourse until the mid-sixteenth century. Among early modern natural philosophers, Bošković singles out three main figures, mainlyDescartes, René,GalileoandKepler, but gradually rejects their explanations. He claims that Kepler came closer than anyone else to a truly scientific and mathematical interpretation of the phenomenon in question. Interestingly, he does not mention two of his Croatian fellow scholars,Federico Chrisogono(De fluxu et refluxu maris) andMarco Antonio de Dominis(Euripus seu de fluxu et refluxu maris sententia), whose interpretations are similar to the modern static theory of the tides. The cause for that is understood to be Chrisogono's strong interest in astrology and de Dominis' controversial legacy as an ecclesiastic, both unacceptable to Bošković. To all the previous tradition, he contrastsNewton'stheory of gravitationand with the use of mathematical arguments tries to prove that it had been the most significant scientific achievement the world had ever seen. Thus, Bošković seeks to put an end to the debates of tidal motions by demonstrating the validity of only one theory, that of Newton.",,"Euripus seu de fluxu et refluxu maris sententia‎(← links)Bošković, Ruđer Josip‎(← links)","Bošković, Ruđer Josip:Dissertatio de maris aestu, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_de_maris_aestu(last revision: 19.11.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

In Sweden, by contrast, they often were still authored by thepraesesof the respectivedisputatio. An interesting example from the realm of botany, which has recently been studied in detail (Krook 2022, on whose findings this entry is based), is provided by theDissertation on the Metamorphosis of Algae,  which the renowned algologist Carl Adolph Agardh let his student Joachim Åkerman defend in apro gradudisputation at the University of Lund in 1820. In this work, the spectacular thesis is upheld that some algae may spontaneously turn into other algae, lichens, mushrooms, or even primitive animals (namely infusoria). That Agardh is the sole author of the text is evident from numerous observations reported in the first person and dated to the 1810s, when the defendant, born in 1798, was still a teenager.After the title page and the dedication to Wilhelm Faxe, bishop of Scania and Blekinge (the latter was composed, as usual, by the defendant, who also paid for the print), the main text comprises 18 octavo pages. By way of introduction (pp. 1–3), Agardh presents his pivotal notion ofmetamorphosisand distinguishes it from the more common botanical meaning of the term, which regards the changes undergone by a plant over the year and during its life cycle, as well as from simple degeneration.Metamorphosisin Agardh's sense is a means by which in early times Nature created new life forms from algae, the first plants on earth. This is followed by reports of nine pertinentobservationesmade by the author, which he presents and explains in the form of first-person narratives: two metamorphoses from animal to alga (obs. 1–2), one from alga to animal (obs. 3), one from fungus to alga (obs. 4), one from alga to lichen (obs. 5), two from alga to another alga (obs. 6–7). The last twoobservationespresent two cases each, which are moreover qualitatively different from the rest and can hardly be subsumed under the above notion ofmetamorphosis: obs. 8 deals with algae composed of two different kinds of algae, obs. 9, with an alga and a flowering plant, both of which appear to consist of another alga under the microscope wholly. These finalobservationesare thus apt to promote a panalgism, so to speak, which Agardh openly embraces in the last sentences of his dissertation (p. 18): algae not only were the first plants ever but all plants are still made up of algae today.Agardh writes fluent, readable Latin. His first-person accounts of his observations and investigations become quite vivid on occasion, including aesthetic judgments and disclosing the narrator's own reasoning and emotions during his work. In generalizing passages, Agardh rises to a certain pathos and likes personifying Nature and its constituents, as when he speaks of Nature's love for her ""firstborn daughters"", the algae (filias primigenitas algas … amavit, p. 18). The terminology is technical regarding names and anatomical structures of algae and the expressionmetamorphosisbut remains untechnical in other respects. The various changes undergone by algae, for instance, are described in a broad range of standard Latin terms (Krook 2022, esp. 18).The dissertation was written for an international readership of specialists from the outset, and it did indeed kindle international attention.

(For a parallel case, see Franz Friedrich Payr'sDissertatio de diaeta litteratorum.) In the present case, the former is the Swabian physician Johann Karl Anton Gerstner and the graduation took place at the University of Innsbruck. Following the early modern tradition of medical dissertations and monographs on the health benefits and disadvantages of beverages, Gerstner writes about drinking pure water, while many of his predecessors had focused on exotic beverages such as coffee, hot chocolate, tea, wine, or beer.As the title already reveals, according to the author, one cannot overestimate the positive effects of drinking pure water for the human body. This is explained along two threads of argument: 1. In accordance with ancient humoralism, the deterioration of the health of the human body happens because of a constant rise in temperature accompanied by gradual dehydration. Drinking water can in this case cool the body and moisten it to prolong its life. 2. Gerstner is also influenced by contemporary discussions of iatromechanics, which views the human body as a machine, functioning according to mechanical principles. Thus, as Gerstner explains, the body is under constant inner and outer pressure, which increase over time. This pressure could constrict the small blood vessels, which would inevitably lead to death in the long run. Again, drinking water can prevent this, because it is the thinnest beverage and can thus dilute the blood. Therefore drinking water can, according to Gerstner and contrary to some widespread prejudices, have life-saving and life-prolonging benefits.The work may have been printed or bound in slightly different versions.

Not only entire issues and volumes were translated, but the same also happened to single contributions such as the presentEssay on the Theory of Gunpowder, Translated from French. Its author was a French engineer and architect who came to fame as the inventor of tunnel warfare. The translator remains anonymous as often, nor is it indicated if the original has already been published elsewhere, and if so, in which periodical.The text, which is articulated in 37 paragraphs, falls into three major sections, as announced in the clear and systematic subdivision given in the opening paragraph. These sections discuss the properties of air, through which an explosion does its damage (§§ 2–11), the composition of gunpowder (§§ 12–20), and the principles of combustion (§§ 21–29) respectively. Clear transitions to the subsequent sections are provided at the ends of §§ 11 and 20. The final section (§§ 30–37), which has not been announced in the beginning, deals with practical aspects of the use of gunpowder in warfare, including some pertinent experiments conducted by the author and others.Conceptually, the theory presented combines modern and premodern aspects. The compressibility of air and the forces that can be released in this way are clearly recognized. The author quantifies his subject, giving precise figures concerning the weight of air and the forces exerted by it and citing experiments of his which demonstrate that the volume of gunpowder magnifies by a factor of 4,000 in the course of an explosion (§§ 6–8). However, lacking a correct notion of the process of combustion, he ascribes the explosiveness of the substance to a kind of pressurized air contained in the powder that expands at the moment of the explosion. Potassium nitrate, the third compound of gunpowder besides sulfur and charcoal, is defined assal multo aëre subtili repletum(§ 15). In general, Bélidor's chemistry is still steeped in chymical traditions. Sulfur and salt are accordingly defined as elements (§ 12).The article features a neat Latin mostly composed of periods of moderate length. Most technical terms are not very specialized, and many are immediately understandable even today because they are shared with the vernaculars. Such is the case oftheoriain the title,abstractumin the extract quoted below, andactivitasin § 16. More difficult expressions are provided with an explanation in one way or another. The Greek wordelater(literally ""driver"", ""driving force""), for instance, is glossed in advance, so to speak, byvirtus elastica(""expansive property"") and explained in greater detail subsequently (§§ 2–3). When the Latin translation risks becoming obscure, the corresponding vernacular terms are added in a few cases:lignum alni nigraeis glossed as ""Faulbaumholz"" and ""bourdaine"" (§ 17). While the translator should be given credit for the text's readability, a frequently noticeable tendency to guide and discipline the reader is probably Bélidor's. It is in evidence already at the end of the opening paragraph:Singula haec capita seorsum iusto examini subicere constitui, verum quoniam eorum tractatio paulo abstractior forte videbitur his, qui physicarum rerum intimiore cognitione imbuti non sunt, monendos duxi, ne quam thesin perfunctorie transeant, nulla enim earum est, quae non ad intelligentiam materiae essentialiter pertineat.I decided to submit each of these main parts separately to a thorough examination. But because their discussion will perhaps appear a bit too abstract to those lacking quite intimate knowledge of the ways of nature, I thought I must admonish them not to bypass inattentively any paragraph, for there is none of them that does not crucially contribute to the understanding of the matter.",,"Bélidor, Bernard Forest de‎(← links)Anonymus 18‎(← links)","Bélidor, Bernard Forest de; Anonymus 18:Dissertatio de theoria pulveris tormentarii e sermone Gallico translata, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_de_theoria_pulveris_tormentarii_e_sermone_Gallico_translata(last revision: 05.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The print of the two letters can be seen as forming part of the publication program of the young academy (cf.Maclean 2019, 83). In their composite work, Major and Sachs present themselves as the perfect embodiment of the combination of friendship and scientific collaboration which constituted the ideal of early modern academies.Both letters are of roughly equal length. They also resemble each other in their affectionate assertions of friendship at the beginning and end, their overall subject (petrefaction), the rarity of direct observation, which is compensated by a high density of quotations (in Latin and German), their at times naive trust in their sources, and their somewhat rambling train of thought (which renders a summary difficult).",,"Sachs von Lewenheimb, Philipp Jacob‎(← links)Major, Johann Daniel‎(← links)De possibilitate physica longaevitatis patriarcharum antediluvianorum‎(← links)De locustis insolitis dissertatio epistolica‎(← links)","Major, Johann Daniel; Sachs von Lewenheimb, Philipp Jacob:Dissertatio epistolica de cancris et serpentibus petrefactis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_epistolica_de_cancris_et_serpentibus_petrefactis(last revision: 17.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It thus represents a more modern form of the genre than the usual dissertations written by thepraesesand only defended by the candidate.The work is dedicated to two older colleagues of Hutton (who later became one of the founding fathers of modern geology) in his hometown Edinburgh. The only paratexts are the title and the dedication, which takes the form of a simpleellogium. The dissertation itself comprises some 30 pages and is subdivided into 91 paragraphs. As indicated in the title, it deals with the blood and its various functions within the human body. After a few introductory remarks (§§ I–III), the first section is concerned with the blood's composition as revealed by microscopical inspection and treatment with various chemicals. Five different 'elements' of which blood is composed are discussed in turn, namely water, earth, salt, sulfur, and air (§§ IV–XXXIX). Next, it is explained how the blood circulates within the body, how it nourishes the latter and enables muscular activity (§§ XLI–XLIX). After this, Hutton elucidates how various bodily liquids such as thesuccus cerebrosus(a somewhat mysterious substance apparently linked to mental activity), tears, saliva, urine, and sperm are secreted from the blood (§§ L–LXVI). An overview of blood circulation is given (§§ LXVII–LXXVII) and the creation of new blood discussed (§§ LXXVIII–LXXXI). The work concludes with a survey ofmalae affectiones, that is, pathological alterations of the blood (§§ LXXXII–XCI).Hutton is fully aware of the many difficulties which his chosen subject presents. In discussing various chemical experiments, for instance, he highlights that their outcome is complicated to the highest degree by the composite nature of the blood, whose single constituents react differently to different substances and moreover influence each others' reactions (§ XIV). In a number of places, the account is interrupted by strings of questions, which often remain unanswered and might be intended as suggestions for future research (e.g. §§ XLIII, LXXIX).In terms of language and style, the work is noteworthy for its highly rhetorical, grand Latin. Long, syntactically complex periods and figurative phrases (cf., e.g.,principii salinis actionis enervatio, ""effeteness of the action of the saline principle"", § XIX) characterize not only the introduction and the concluding remarks, but also many technical passages. Clearly, the work was intended to showcase Hutton's good education in general besides his medical prowess. However, this lofty style is combined with a high amount of technical vocabulary, some of which sounds quite recent, since it appears in the same meaning in the modern vernaculars (e.g. § LXXXIII,indispositio; § LXXXIV,contaminatus). Several striking verbs such assupercombinari(""to enter complex combinations"", § XV) orsanguificare(""to produce blood"") could be neologisms coined by Hutton himself.",,"Hutton, James‎(← links)","Hutton, James:Dissertatio inauguralis de sanguine et circulatione microcosmi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_inauguralis_de_sanguine_et_circulatione_microcosmi(last revision: 19.08.2021).",,"DB, MK, JL",Yes,MK,

In this book, he attempted to demonstrate that God had created the earth not by supernatural intervention, but by using the laws of nature to his end. Drawing partly on English authors such asThomas Burnet, Clüver formulated some novel and heterodox hypotheses: among other things, the Creation had taken, not six days, but six years, the sun had originally risen in the west, and comets had played a decisive role in the early history of the earth.Within a few months after the publication of this dangerous book, a disputation was held about it at the University of Rostock, probably on the basis of a thesis broadsheet. Shortly after, presumably still in the same year, this disputation was published as a booklet by the defendant, who is called itsauctoron the title page and praised by thepraesesfor hisegregias primitias(""extraordinary first fruits"") at the end. In a preface of one and a half pages, Schnabel explains that his attack on Clüver's work has been inspired by Herbert Croft, bishop of Hereford, who similarly reacted to Burnet'sTelluris theoria sacra.The dissertation itself, which fills 22 unnumbered quarto pages, covers Clüver's work selectively. It falls into tenquaestiones, each of which picks up and refutes a certain position uphold by Clüver: the Creation did not happen according to the laws of nature (qu. I), the primordialtohu wa-bohuwas not the tail of a comet (qu. II), it comprised not only the earth, but also the rest of the later universe (qu. III), which had not been not created before the six days of creation (qu. IV), the earth had not developed out of a comet (qu. V), the six days of the biblical account do not denote six years (qu. VI), the sun and the stars never rose in the west (qu. VII), the earth after the Flood was not a newly created one, but basically the same as before (qu. VIII), the Flood was not caused by a comet (qu. IX), nor will a comet bring about the end of the world (qu. X). The single chapters usually fall into two or three paragraphs. They start from a paraphrase of Clüver's opinion and/or a quotation from his German text (§1), which is followed by Schnabel's refutation (§2) and sometimes answers to possible objections (§3).To debunk Clüver's theory, Schnabel mainly draws on philological and theological reasoning. In qu. VI, for instance, he adduces the following seven numbered arguments: (1) the Hebrew wordyomused in the biblical account of the Creation means ""day"", not ""year""; (2) it refers to normal days, as eachyomhas a morning and an evening; (3) the expression is explicitly opposed to ""year"" elsewhere; (4) in imitation of God's work, we work six days a week, not six years; (5) Clüver's assumption is based on his already refuted idea of a Creation conforming to the laws of nature; (6) it goes against God's glory and omnipotence; (7) it contradicts the exegetical tradition. Besides arguments, Schnabel reviles his opponent as a person, Christian, and writer, and speaks of his ideas in pejorative terms throughout. In saidquaestio, he reproaches him withmaxime taediosa prolixitas(""extremely gross garrulity""), calls his positionsdeliria(""hallucinations"") andblasphema, and asks:Num Cluverus DEO vult praescribere regulas, secundum quas mundum creare debuerit?(""Does Clüver want to prescribe GOD according to which rules he had to create the world?"") The origin of Schnabel's book transpires in his use of the technical language of thedisputatio. Still in the samequaestio, he introduces his own position with the wordsThesis nostra haec est(""Our thesis is as follows""), his arguments byProb(atur)and his answers to counterarguments byResp(ondeo).The prehistory of the earth and the question of how the biblical account of the Creation was to be understood kindled lively interest in the 17th and 18th centuries (Poole 2010), and Schnabel's work seems to have been in demand over several years. In 1709, his publisher reissued it in a clearer type and more reader-friendly format, but otherwise unchanged. Today, the booklet is notable as a good example of a 'review dissertation' which moreover reaches out beyond the academic world in its engagement with a hotly debated topic and in discussing a vernacular work.",,,"Grape, Zacharias; Schnabel, Johann:Dissertatio philosophica examinans placita quaedam scripti recentissimi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_philosophica_examinans_placita_quaedam_scripti_recentissimi(last revision: 17.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The present example was defended by two candidates, Ludwig Timotheus von Spittler and Theodor Breunlin, at the University of Tübingen in August 1772.From the use of the first-person singular and the didactic perspective expressed in the proem (§1), it is clear that the dissertation was written by thepraesesJohann Kies, professor of physics and mathematics. Kies' expressed aim in this dissertation is to present a mathematical explanation of the rainbow which is suited to those who have problems with infinitesimal calculus (facilius et ad captum etiam eorum, quibus calculus infinitesimalis crux est, accommodatius).The 20-page dissertation is divided into 32 numbered paragraphs, which vary in length between two to three lines and one and a half pages. The longer paragraphs often include several lines of mathematical formulae and calculations on the basis of trigonometry. These are based on six diagrams which are printed on a separate leaf and bound into the dissertation. Kies only uses the modern trigonometric functions sinus, cosinus and tangent and some of their basic relations; they have obviously become the main toolkit of trigonometry during the 18th century.Following the proem (§1) and a definition of the rainbow (§2), three principal questions are addressed in the dissertation (§3): the colours of the rainbow (§4–5), its width (§6–20, carrying out the trigonometric calculations based on Snell's law of refraction) and its size (§21–22). After a series of corollaries (§23), the dissertation names other instances where rainbows can appear, e.g. moonbows (§24–28). It is then specified that the sun, which has been treated as a point in the calculations above, has in fact a width of 30' (§29). At the close of the text, two observations byRoger Boscovich(§30) and August Nathanael Grischow (§31) are discussed, before the dissertation ends with a short consideration on whether the rainbow existed before the biblical flood or not (§32).",,"Kies, Johann‎(← links)","Kies, Johann:Dissertatio physica de iride, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_physica_de_iride(last revision: 13.09.2021).","In the first sentence of the dissertation, Kies says that every year, he readPhysica Segneriana.

The presentPhysical-Medical Dissertation on the Influence of the Planetsbelongs to a series of attempts at saving the doctrine of planetary influence on earth by basing it on uncontroversial foundations provided by the new science. The booklet, which comprises some 50 octavo pages, was authored by the later inventor of animal magnetism, Franz Anton Mesmer, who defended it, apparently in a disputationsine praeside, for his medical doctorate.The work may be called a ""thesis dissertation"" in the sense that it unfolds a coherent argument in favour of a truly contentious position, something quite rare in early modern dissertations. In short, Mesmer's thesis is that the planets (including the sun and the moon) influence all terrestrial events simply through gravitation. In order to uphold his point, Mesmer uses a rhetorical strategy that starts from the universally accepted and step by step extends its implications, compensating the increasingly speculative nature of the argument by numerous quotations from respected medical authors. After a few introductory remarks, he first provides an extensive account of Newtonian celestial mechanics and the role of gravitation in it (pp. 7–20). Based on this, it is explained how the tides are caused by solar and lunar attraction (pp. 21–26). Mesmer goes on to postulate (not a wrong thought in principle) that sun and moon must have an analogous effect on the atmosphere, which may act on the human body in turn (pp. 26–32). Moreover, since a living being is subject to gravitation in the same way as everything else (a fact termedgravitas animalis, p. 33), the moon's gravitational effect also acts directly on the fluids of the human body and thereby exerts a strong influence on its health, as is confirmed by numerous case studies (pp. 32–44). One also has to assume that the other planets and the fixed stars cause similar effects and that these effects are not restricted to health but extend to all aspects of human life (pp. 44–46). Given the great importance of the topic, much research should be done on it in the future (pp. 46–48). This reasoning is backed up by appeals for an unprejudiced hearing, especially in a preliminary note (praemonitum, pp. [3–6]). Mesmer also takes care to underline that he invents nothing new in principle, but only provides a scientific fundament for an age-old belief, and to distance himself from an astrology depicted as vain and superstitious. Moreover, he proves to be a capable Latinist, outlining his position in smooth periods, as already becomes evident from the work's opening sentence (pp. 7–8):Planetarum influxui ex constanti observatione omni retro aetate tantus honos a mortalibus habitus est, ut agricultura, ars nautica, medicina plurimum eorum imperio tribuerent, donec astrologi supervenerunt, qui innumeris vanisque commentis suis veritatem hanc foedum in modum corruperunt ac deformarunt.Based on permanent observation, the influence of the planets has been revered so much among the mortals, that farming, seafaring, medicine held their sway in the highest opinion, until the astrologers entered the stage, nastily sullying and distorting this truth by their countless vain concoctions.Apparently, Mesmer was able to convince the notables of Vienna University of his perspective.

Vierter Band, 271–307",1767,Munich,[no publisher/printer indicated],18th century,"Monograph, Other (see description), Journal Paper","Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography, Meteorology/Earth sciences",Dissertatio pro praemio de ratione motus(IZWT Universität Wuppertal),702832,"In the 18th century, some academies began to set out prizes for the most convincing answers to or discussions of certain questions or topics. This practice and the new genre of the prize essay engendered by it remained popular until the early 20th century. ThePrize Essay on the Relation between the Moon's Medium Speed and Medium Distance from the Earth on the One Hand and the Forces Acting upon It on the Otheris remarkable as one of not too many early specimens of the genre that are still written in Latin – a fact that is all the more striking because the Churfürstlich-baierische Akademie der Wissenschaften was actually the first academy in the German world to publish its proceedings in the vernacular from the very beginning. (For a somewhat earlier Latin specimen, see Euler'sDissertatio de magnete.) Presumably an exception was made for a learned Jesuit mathematician who had never published anything in an other language than Latin. Kraz's essay came out second, while the first prize went to Johann Albrecht Euler, the eldest son of the famous mathematician, whose German essay directly precedes the one by Kraz in the first volume of theAbhandlungen.The Academy's prize question fell into two parts: 1) How does the moon's distance from the earth relate to its weight? 2) How does this weight relate to the moon's hypothetical weight on the surface of the earth? The ultimate motive behind the question was the desire to check the measurement of the distance between earth and moon via the latter's parallax by means of another, independent method (p. 273). In principle, this was not too hard to do even in the 18th century. The hypothetical circulation period of a body rounding the earth at the equator could be reckoned from the known gravitational force at the earth's surface, and the moon's distance from the earth could then be calculated from its equally known circulation period via Kepler's third law. The matter was however complicated by a number of factors from the elliptical (not circular) shape of the moon's orbit to the polar flattening of the earth and the possibly different density of its various parts.Having sketched the basic question and outlined his procedure (a nice application of the rhetorical technique ofpropositioto a scientific topic) in three introductory paragraphs, Kraz gives his answer in paragraphs 4–35, which are subsumed under sevenproblemata. The results of his calculations (illustrated by a diagram, unfortunately largely invisible in the digital copy) are in good agreement with the values for the distance between earth and moon reached by means of the lunar parallax.Polite gestures towards the Academy at the beginning and end apart, the treatise is written in a technical, impersonal Latin that nonetheless betrays the author's typically Jesuit, that is, literary and rhetorical, culture in some respects. Kraz freely uses the technical terminology of 18th century physics and astronomy: expressions such assemidiameter(""radius""),horologium oscillatorium(""pendulum clock"") ormotus uniformiter acceleratus(""uniformly accelerated motion"") abound. He is also unafraid of word repetition in the interest of clarity and quotes previous research literature in the text and occasionally in footnotes. Regarding the syntax, however, the only statements not given as full sentences are theproblemata, which are formulated, in a tradition going back to Euclid, as infinitive clauses (cf. for example problem VII, p. 288:Determinare rationem virium gravitatis lunae ad vires gravitatis corporum terrestrium sub aequatore, ""To determine the ratio of the gravitational forces acting upon the moon to the gravitational forces acting upon bodies on the surface of the earth at the equator""). Everything else is conveyed in syntactically complete sentences. Even numerical calculations are syntactically embedded, although the running text is sometimes broken up typographically. Moreover, the reasoning is not divided into short sentences as in modern, and already some early modern, scientific writing. Quite the opposite: Kraz tries to clarify the logical structure of his argumentation by means of long periods with many subordinate clauses linked by causal, conditional, concessive etc. conjunctions. These periods tend to be 'exhaustive' in the sense that each period ideally encompasses one complete train of thought (see for example p. 283, where paragraph 12 consists of one single fourteen-lines period).",,"Kraz, Georg‎(← links)","Kraz, Georg:Dissertatio pro praemio de ratione motus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dissertatio_pro_praemio_de_ratione_motus(last revision: 19.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Although nowadays the name of Benedetti is barely known, he was one of the leading mathematicians and experts in mechanics and physics. This resulted in the present work, which is a collection of treatises and letters containing his findings in these fields. Although every part has a specific topic (the first treatise is on arithmetic theorems, the second deals with the operations of perspective, and the fifth comments on the fifth book of Euclid'sElementsand so forth), the subjects might overlap and be explained in various parts throughout the compendium. This miscellaneous character, reflected, among other things, in different parts' length, also determines the ways in which Benedetti approaches the themes: thus, the first book is composed as a series of responses to his patron's, duke of Savoy's queries concerning arithmetics. A few names appear in the text - the only scholars Benedetti clearly praises are Pythagoras, Ptolemy and Euclid; in the meantime, the content reveals that Benedetti was perfectly aware of contemporary developments in mathematics and physics and in many respects seeked to develop the findings of his predecessors, includingCardano,Gemma Frisius,Michael Stifeland others. The main body of the treatise is mainly technical and contains a significant number of illustrations complement the texts. Benedetti's meticulous investigation into linear perspective and various arithmetical problems, as well as his theory of proportions, are all put in relation to contemporary trends in mathematics.The work starts with a table of contents, listing the six treatises of the book, a dedication letter to Charles Emanuel of Savoy and a preface to the reader.Thetreatise on arithmeticscontains 153 arithmetical theorems with geometrical proofs and an appendix on theregula falsi.Thetreatise on perspectivecomprises only some 20 pages.""On mechanics""is treatise 3;the fourth, theDisputationes de quibusdam placitis Aristotelisrejects many of the Aristotelian principles of motion on some 30 pages. As previously published in hisResolutio, and in corrected version in hisDemonstratio proportionum motuum localium(Venice 1554), Benedetti contributes to the discussion on free-falling bodies and rejects Aristotle's principle that heavier bodies are supposed to move faster to the ground.The fifth treatiseis a short commentary on Euclid's Book V of theElements.Thesixth partis endowed with a short preface consists of a huge amount of various letters on miscellaneous topics. Among the adressees there are Emmanuel Philibert (Duke of Savoy) and again Charles Emmanuel (Duke of Savoy), but also Cipriano da Rore, to whom Benedetti had senttwo letters on the physics of consonancein 1563. He appears to be an admirer ofCopernicusand knows theDe triangulis omnimodisofRegiomontanuswhich he refers to asMonteregius([1]) and also of Ovid, whosePhaetoniscited selectively. Altogether, the letters form the major part of the whole collection.Although groundbreaking in many regards (and especially concerning the overcoming of Aristotelic mechanics) there seems to be very little adoption of the work among contemporaries:Galileiworking on similar ground is rather unlikely to have had knowledge of theSpeculationesand does not mention Benedetti at all; only Simon Stevin andKeplerdo so (Dict.

Correspondingly many commentaries on it appeared in print. The work's fourth and last book differs from the first three in several respects. Inter alia, it is not concerned with atmospheric or geological phenomeny, but with changes undergone by bodies in general, and its explanations do not resort to exhalations, but to warm and cold. The differences are such that the place of the book within the treatise and even Aristotle's authorship have been contested by modern scholars (Louis 1982, vol. 1, pp. X–XVIII). Presumably on account of its particularity, some early modern commentaries are dedicated exclusively to this book. One of them are Pietro Pomponazzi'sDoubts about the Fourth Book of Aristotle's Meteorology, which were published nearly forty years after the author's death.TheDoubtsprobably are the late fruit of lectures given at Padua, Ferrara, or Bologna. They are introduced by a letter of dedication to the Tridentine prince-bishop Lodovico Madruzzo, which is signed neither by Pomponazzi nor by the publisher, but by the printer Niccolò Bevilacqua, who seems to have played quite an active role in the preparation of the manuscript for publication. After a table of contents and anindex rerum, 128 doubts are discussed on one hundred quarto pages in the order in which the text gives rise to them. The work might be called a problem-oriented commentary, an exegetical contribution to theproblemataliterature, or a series ofquaestiones disputatae(a scholastic format on which seeLawn 1993).The length of the singledubitationesvaries from four lines to six pages. The argument presented in them may contain all or some of the following points: the identification of the problem, the opinions of earlier commentators (Alexander of Aphrodisias, Themistius, Averroes, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas and others), Pomponazzi's own opinion, arguments in its favour, and the refutation of  counterarguments. The point under discussion may be the correct interpretation of Aristotle's text, the truth of the matter itself, or both. Occasionally, Pomponazzi's listeners or readers are exhorted to reconsider the topic for themselves, as in the shortDubitatio XXXIII, which discusses differences between various cooking processes, a subject treated inMeteorologica4.2–3:Aliud dubium: Dicit Aristoteles, quod frixa sunt assata, quia attrahunt humidum et fiunt humidiora quam elixa, et per hoc conveniunt cum assis, sunt autem humidiora intus et per hoc differunt ab elixatis. Videtur, quod hac ratio non valeat, quoniam assati humidum est alterius generis quam frixorum, cum assorum humiditas sit propria, frixorum autem aliena et extrinseca. Super hoc considerate.""Another doubt: Aristotle says that fried victuals are at the same time roasted, because they attract moisture and become moister than victuals boiled and in this respect are similar to victuals roasted, but that they are moister inside and differ from victuals boiled in this respect. It seems that this reasoning is not cogent, because the moisture of victuals roasted is of a kind that differs from the moisture of victuals fried, because the moisture of victuals roasted is their own, whereas the moisture of victuals fried is foreign and external.

Università di Bologna,Incipit:Impetrata prius licentia…'Title' (after preamble):Dubium astrologicum,,1509,Bologna,,16th century,Other (see description),Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Download PDF(Transcript),not available,"Many academicdisputationeswere announced by handwritten or printed placards. Most of these humble and ephemeral documents, which provide first-hand insight into an important aspect of university life, are of course lost for good, but some have been preserved until today.The present specimen from early 16th century Bologna (whose original cannot be displayed for copyright reasons) is a case in point. At the local arts faculty, remunerated one-year lectureships were offered to less affluent advanced students on the condition that they successfully disputed about the subject on which they wanted to lecture. The German Jakob Ebelin, who already had earned his master of arts degree, obviously aspired to a lectureship in astronomy during the academic year 1509/10, which he also obtained. As specified in the opening paragraph, his disputation would take place on a Friday, 30 March, with the permission of the student rector of the arts and medical faculties and under the presidency of Dr Galeotto Beccadelli, a professor of medical theory.On the rest of the broadsheet, the topics to be discussed are listed under the headingAn Astrological Doubt. The main question is whether planets shine with their own light. At the time, thecommunis opiniowas that they do (only in 1610 century would Galilei detect that Venus shows phases and therefore must shine with reflected sunlight, seeWootton 2015, 222–224), and this is also the final conclusion reached by Ebelin. In addition, he defends six more conclusions, two of which are accompanied by a corollary. All conclusions relate to the main question in some way or other, but they do not represent necessary preconditions for answering it, nor do follow each other in strictly logical succession. Thedisputatiorather features an open structure providing many possible starting points for questions from the audience. Another detail implies that the discussion triggered by the questions was intended to be undogmatic and open-ended, at least in part: Ebelin's attitude to the singleconclusionesandcorrelariaare not uniform, but quite nuanced. True, the first twoconclusiones, the fourth with itscorrelarium, and the final one are stated in apodictic indicatives, and Ebelin also shows himself determined to the defend the third (firmiter tenemus). By contrast, he will only try to uphold (sustinere conabimur) the fifth, he admits (concedimus) the sixth, and he is not opposed (non negamus) to itscorrelarium. Presumably in order to interest an academic, but mostly non-expert audience in the event, the contents to be disputed are formulated in not overly technical, easily understandable Latin.The preserved copy of the announcement bears two handwritten notes in the top left and right corners (thanks to Lav Subaric for their deciphermet). These obviously relate to organisational practicalities, but their exact meaning and the identity of the writer present a small conundrum. The top left note simply saysM(agistri) Iacobi Ebellini Germani Astrologia(""[Disputation] of Master Jakob Ebelin from Germany. [Discipline:] Astrology""). On the right, one reads:Presentate die Iovis 29. Martii 1509. Disputate die sequenti me presente.(""Present [what? to whom?] on Thursday, 29 March 1509. Conduct the disputation the following day in my presence."")APPENDIX: TRANSLATIONHaving first received permission from the grandiose, noble lord Girolamo Tigrino de Bagnacavallo, the exceedingly honorable rector of the artists and physicians of the nurturing University of Bologna, Jakob Ebelin from Germany, master of arts, the least among the students of medicine, will try to uphold the below-mentioned doubt with the pertinent conclusions and corollaries under the presidency of the most distinguished doctor and master of arts and medicine Galeotto de Bicadelli on Friday, the next-to-last day of March.Astronomical doubtAre the heavenly bodies luminous by themselves, or do they receive their light from another body?First conclusion: Although the sun is situated in the middle of the planets, it does not provide them with all their brightness.Second conclusion: If a celestial body is in opposition to another celestial body, this does not hinder its light.Third conclusion: We are of the firm conviction that there is greater luminosity in the sun than in the other planets.Fourth conclusion: Not any part of the sky is equally dense or rarified as the rest.Corollary: Not any given part of the sky is luminous and translucent to the same degree as the rest.Fifth conclusion: We will try to uphold that any given part of the sky is luminous by itself.Sixth conclusion: We admit that all celestial bodies cause heat in the things here on earth by their light.Corollary: We do not deny that some body may cause not only heat, but even cremation in the things here on earth by its light.Final response: The affirmative answer to the doubt is true.","Grendler 2001, 154–155 (with image of the original document)",Università di Bologna‎(← links),"Università di Bologna:Dubium astrologicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Dubium_astrologicum(last revision: 28.01.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

"Euclides,Campanus, Johannes","Opus elementorum Euclidis Megarensis in geometriam artem, in id quoque Campani perspicacissimi commentationes",,1482,Venice,Ratdolt,15th century since invention of printing,"Commentary, Translation",Mathematics,Elementa(e-rara.ch)Alternative link:MDZ,911544,"This is theeditio princepsof Euclid'sElementsand constitutes the first of a vast amount of prints making theElementsthe second most printed book after the Bible up to the 19th century (Steck 1981, esp. 12).This edition contains not only books 1–13, as modern editions do, but also a 14th and a 15th book, considered spurious today. The text makes free use of letters, as does the Greek original, and features a dense, technical Latin that is often hard to follow. It is based on a compendium (the so-called version II) attributed to Adelard of Bath but most probably assembled by Robert of Chester before 1168 (Busard 1998, 112) using several mostly Arabic sources. Campanus of Novara (between 1255 and 1259,Steck 1981, 29) made a revision with verbatim enunciations but with some proofs diverging considerably from the model. Furthermore, he also added a commentary of sorts which is typographically undistinguishable in the print from the proofs given by Euclid, however. This may reflect the fact that the proofs were thought to be of secondary importance anyway and often regarded not as the work of Euclid at all, but as a kind of commentary by Theon of Alexandria who produced an influential redaction of the work in the 4th century CE. In fact, as the study of manuscripts shows, the Campanus-Robert-Adelard-tradition goes back to Arabic sources based onpre-theonictexts (Steck 1981, 186) and therefore Campanus's edition is a commented rework of the Arabic tradition of Euclid. Manuscripts based on these editions were widespread in the late middle ages and ""Campanus"" was by far the most common reference to Euclid.Campanus additional comments decidedly coined the understanding of the results of Euclid. For example, he denied the intermediate value theorem or claimed that the angle between a circle and its tangent, though being smaller than any acute angle, is a positive quantity. These comments resulted in learned disputes among mathematicians likePeletier,Vieta,WallisorClavius, the latter in hisEuclidis elementorum libri XV(Steck 1981, 30).Apart from that, the printer Erhard Ratdolt, a leading representative of his profession, has created a masterpiece, drawing largely on the design of medieval Euclid manuscripts (Lowood; Rider 2000, 6). He produced a lucid print image despite the use of the Gothic script, divided the text into short units, distinguished theorems from proofs by larger and smaller font respectively, and added c. 400 mathematical diagrams, essential for a correct understanding of the text, in the outer margins – the first ones ever to appear in a printed book. Ratdolt proudly draws attention to this circumstance in the opening letter of dedication to the Doge of Venice (which is printed in gold in a number of copies). Apart from the dedication, the only short paratext is the colophon, which stands as a substitute to the nonexistent title page and contains the bibliographical information adduced in this entry.A second edition came out in 1491, followed by at least twelve further ones (Dictionary of Scientific Biography 1970–1986, vol. 3, 24).","Edition of Campanus' text:Busard 2005Secondary literature:Clagett 1953;Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 3, 23–29;Steck 1981;Busard 1998;Baldasso 2008","Arithmeticorum libri II‎(← links)Pappi Alexandrini Mathematicae collectiones‎(← links)Euclides‎(← links)Campanus, Johannes‎(← links)Resolutio omnium Euclidis problematum‎(← links)Procli in primum Euclidis Elementorum librum Commentaria‎(← links)Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum‎(← links)Speculum astronomicum‎(← links)Algorithmus minutiarum vulgarium‎(← links)Prolegomena‎(← links)Positiones physio-astronomicae‎(← links)De circuli quadratura tandem adinventa et demonstrata‎(← links)Diversarum speculationum mathematicarum et physicarum liber‎(← links)Commentaria in Tractatum proportionum Alberti de Saxonia‎(← links)Euclidis elementorum libri XV‎(← links)Opuscula mathematica‎(← links)Arithmetica integra‎(← links)Mathematici tractatus duo‎(← links)","Euclides; Campanus, Johannes:Elementa, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Elementa(last revision: 14.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

Weinhart undertook his instruction in mathematics and natural sciences and later saw to it that Anich was charged with various cartographic commissions. When Anich died during the work at his monumentalAtlas Tyrolensis(at long last published in 1774), he had already become a local celebrity.Shortly after Anich's death, Weinhart composed two manuscript biographies of the ""peasant cartographer"". Based on those, Weinhart's fellow Jesuit Maximilian Hell appended a printedObituary of the Most Famous Tyrolian Peasant Peter Anichto hisEphemerides astronomicae anni 1767(Vienna 1766). Two years later, this text was reprinted, in a slightly corrected version enlarged by two appendixes, in Innsbruck.In his preface (pp. 3–5), Hell contrasts Anich with another gifted peasant, a protestant from Saxony, and finds the former far superior. Moreover, he justifies his interest in him with the fact that Anich also has constructed a celestial globe and that a new geodetic method invented by him merits to be made publicly known because of its great usefulness. The life proper starts from Anich's humble origins (pp. 6–7) and proceeds to his discovery and instruction by Weinhart (pp. 7–8). Anich begins his career as a cartographer by constructing various globes and geodetic instruments (pp. 8–11). After that, he charts the Italian parts of Tyrol (present-day Trentino) and finally is entrusted with the aforementionedAtlas Tyrolensis, a task he tackles with great dedication and expertise (pp. 11–17). Alas, his body succumbs to the enormous efforts and he dies in 1766 (pp. 17–20; his epitaph is reported on p. 20). The biography proper closes with a sketch of Anich's physical appearance (pp. 21–22) and an appraisal of his virtues and strength of mind (pp. 22–29). Appendix one discusses a geodetic instrument invented by Anich specifically for mountainous regions such as the Tyrol (pp. 29–34). The second appendix presents Anich's successor Blasius Hueber, a native of the same village as his predecessor and nearly equally gifted (pp. 35–38). The reader is also cautioned against a French translation of the biography's Viennese original, marred by a great many errors.Written in fluent Latin and structured in a way reminiscent of Suetonius' biographies, theElogium Petri Anichnot only reports an unusual and remarkable career in applied science. It also testifies to the meritocratic spirit of two enlightened Jesuits who did not hesitate to honour a peasant in a form that usually was reserved for members of the aristocracy and the learned class. Some catholic bias, Tyrolian patriotism and sensationalism notwithstanding, this short biography is a noteworthy achievement.","Büchner 1976Korenjak; Schaffenrath; Subaric; Töchterle 2012, 779–780.","Weinhart, Ignaz‎(← links)Hell, Maximilian‎(← links)","Hell, Maximilian; Weinhart, Ignaz:Elogium Petri Anich, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Elogium_Petri_Anich(last revision: 07.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Heyne presumably was chosen as speaker because he held the chair of rhetoric at the university. As will become evident, his background in the humanities did not deter him from discussing in some detail various branches of natural science and Vogel's respective achievements.The speech falls into a number of paragraphs mostly separated from each other by blank lines. The speaker begins by looking back to another Academy oration of his four years ago, when he still could number Vogel among the living (pp. 1–2). Because of his learning and good character, Vogel's death gravely afflicts all members (pp. 2–3). Medicine may be called thedisciplinarum regina(""queen of disciplines"") due to the encyclopedic knowledge which it presupposes (pp. 3–4). In particular, a doctor has to be a good chemist. Much equipment as well as great strenuity and patience are required to master the art of medicine (pp. 4–5). Vogel, who was an expert in chemistry in addition to being a physician, greatly adorned the University of Göttingen (p. 5). His chemical expertise was demonstrated in three talks to the Academy. He used to work diligently and without undue haste (p. 6). His interest in chemistry dated back to his youth and resulted in various talks and publications (p. 6). In addition, Vogel also worked in the field of natural history (pp. 6–7). Despite his love of chemistry, he never overestimated this discipline (p. 7). He also was active and successfull as a pharmacologist (p. 7), a prognosticator (pp. 7–8), a surgeon and medical practitioner (p. 8). Well versed in classical literature in general, he showed great interest and expertise in the writings of the Greek physicians (p. 9). During his last illness and in the face of death, he remained obliging towards others and undeterred himself (pp. 9–10). The Academy's members will remember him forever (p. 10).For reasons unknown, Heyne's speech does not exhibit a clear-cut structure, but rather appears to be a bit disjointed at times. What is most strikingly absent in comparison with other funerary orations such asJohann von Jesse'sDe vita et morte Tychonis Brahei oratio funebrisor theVita Danielis Bernoulliperformed by the deceased's nephew is a coherent account of Vogel's life. Only a few bits of biographical information are scattered across the speech, and with the exception of Vogel's death, they exclusively concern his professional life.In terms of style, Heyne constructs long and complex periods in impeccably classical Latin. The sadness inflicted by Vogel's demise is duly emphasised, but the speech's pathos remains moderate. Likewise, the praise of the deceased is generous, but not excessive. Such emotional restraint is typical of Enlightenment eloquence.",,"Heyne, Christian Gottlob‎(← links)","Heyne, Christian Gottlob:Elogium Rudolphi Augustini Vogel, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Elogium_Rudolphi_Augustini_Vogel(last revision: 24.03.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In another respect, however, the title is deceiving: The emblems are not devoted exclusively to purple and not even to the various conchs producing this substance, but to shells and conchs in general, reflecting the author's expertise in the field of conchology. Rather, the emphasis on purple is meant to to provide a link to the investment of Reyher with the prorectoral purple and to his impending marriage to anobilissima sponsawhose beauty manifests itself in her ""purple"" complexion. Major dwells lovingly on these connections in his letter of dedication.The emblems themselves provide excellent examples of the natural historical emblem, a subgenre of the emblem founded by Johannes Camerarius the Younger (1534–1598). Each emblem consists of a motto in metrical form (pentameters or parts of hexameters), a woodcut showing one or several conchs or shells and an explanatory text of some 10–25 lines. These texts contain, in various order, a description of the animal(s) depicted, some information on their way of life, backed up by classical, biblical and recent authorities (sometimes with exact references), and a religious or philosophical moral to be drawn from their behaviour. A good part of the natural historical information given is derived from Fabio Colonna's treatiseDe purpura(On Purple, 1616), a work Major was profoundly acquainted with and which he would re-edit with ample commentary and other additions a few years later, in 1674. Regarding the moral content, emblems I– VI are concerned with Christian behaviour in general, VII–IX with love and marriage, X–XII with death.TheEmblemata de purpuraare remarkable both for the close association of science, erudition, moral philosophy and piety whicih they display and for Major's usage of them to celebrate a festive event and to honour a frient.

Anonymus 5,"Enchiridion medicinae medicamentorum tam simplicium quam compositorum in certos titulos distinctam silvam continens, quorum in pharmacopoliis et medicinis praecipuus est usus",,1573,Basel,Perna,16th century,"Other (see description), Compendia",Medicine,Enchiridion medicinae(Google Books)Alternative link:MDZ,608626,"This concise pharmacopoeia (only 39 pages apart from the title page and dedication) is usually ascribed to the doctor, polymath and school teacherGeorg Henisch(1549–1618), but this is mistaken. Henisch, who was a student of medicine at the time, is not named as the author on the work's title page. In his letter of dedication to a certainIohanni, Baroni Kitliciano(Baron of Kittlitz from Löbau, Upper Lusatia?), Henisch only states that he has suggested (author fuissem) to Peter Perna to reprint theEnchiridion medicinae, which apparently was first published in 1571 in Paris (Šimon 2018; I have been unable to verify this edition).In terms of content, theEnchiridion medicinaeis a compilation of three French pharmacological works from the 1550s, as ascertained byŠimon 2018. Despite the ostentatiously user-friendly layout with its numerous subtitles, the overall structure remains somewhat unclear. The better part of the account appears to be divided into drugs preparing for purgation (praeparantia, pp. 8–17), purging drugs (purgantia, pp. 17–33) and invigorating drugs (confortantia, pp. 34–41), although an oblique explanation of this structure seems to be given only afterwards (p. 41). In the last part (pp. 41–46),  various forms of administration such as the decoct, the infusion or the pill are discussed, followed by two chapters on drugs that induce sweating and vomiting. On the fine structural level, the contrast between simples and composite drugs as well as the various parts of the plants used play the most important role.The text is syntactically simple; often, it is even reduced to the bare enumeration of variuos drugs. The vocabulary freely draws on the medieval tradition of pharmaceutics, including loanwords from the Muslim world such asiulapium(""sweet potion"", p. 41), which is derived from Persiangulāb(""rosewater"") via Arabicjulāb. Pharmaceutical symbols are only used for apothecaries' weights such as ounces and drachms.The most interesting aspect of Henisch's dedication is his awareness of theenchiridionas a distinct genre of scientific literature with rules of its own:Quamvis in enchiridio magnitudo spectari non debet, cum quo minus est, eo animos studiosorum ad ediscendum evolvendumque magis alliciat et provocet(""But in an enchiridion, one must not take size into account, for the smaller it is, the more it allures students and entices them into learning it by heart and consulting it"", pp. 6–7).Somewhat confusingly, Perna also printed aEnchiridion medicumin the same year 1573, which is in plain prose and contains simples only.",Šimon 2018,Enchiridion medicum‎(← links)Anonymus 5‎(← links),"Anonymus 5:Enchiridion medicinae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Enchiridion_medicinae(last revision: 06.02.2022).",Encheiridion,MK,Yes,MK,

Most of these are of vegetal, but some also of animal (e.g.Cornu cervi, ""staghorn"") or mineral (Naphta, ""petrol"") origin. After the respective lemma, each entry consists of an epigram (one to six elegiac couplets) and a short prose text.

The book itself is a hybrid of aRechenbuch(on which genre seeGärtner 2000) and an introduction to arithmetics for students: its content (see below) is basically that of aRechenbuch, but unlike such works, which are primarily addressed to merchants and therefore written in the vernacular, it is in Latin (for a similar work, see theArithmeticae practicae methodus facilis). TheEnchiridion's intermediate status, which presumably results from its catering to the widest possible readership, is in evidence already in the introductory paratexts. The title mentions merchants but at the same time claims that the work is essential for people ""of any status whatsoever"" (cuiuscumque status). An anonymous epigram against enviers on the title page is neutral in this respect, but a 18 lines elegy by Hermann von dem Busche on the following page is addressed to thestudiis addicta iuventus(""youth dedicated to study"") and ends with a learned allusion to Pythagoras. The preface to thelectores candidissimiemphasizes the impossibility to learn any other sciences, esp. from the quadrivium, without arithmetics.The treatise proper covers no more than forty quarto pages, albeit in dense Gothic script with many abbreviations. It is divided into four parts (tractatus) which are further subdivided into short chapters.  The first three parts (of which the second and third are transposed in the preface) deal with the basic arithmetic operations, the technique of ""reckoning on the lines"" (i.e., on a calculating table) and fractions respectively. The last part discusses the rule of three (regula detri) and presents some twenty exemplary exercises (also calledregulae), most of which are taken from the mercantile world. (Scores of simple examples are also given in the first three parts).The text is written in a syntactically simple Latin that makes full use of the technical terminology of medieval mathematics: words such as the title'salgorismus(from the name of the Persian scholar al-Khwarizmi), the abovementioneddetri(probably from the Italian for ""of three""),proba(""test""),proiectiles(the lines of the reckoning board) orprogressio(the addition of a set of figures from an arithmetical sequence, e.g. 1+3+5+7) abound. The Arabic numerals and the fraction bar are constantly used, but there is little else in terms of mathematical notation. The symbols for the basic arithmetic operations, for instance, are still lacking (as they came into fashion only in the second half of the 16th century,Cajori 2011, 204). The author keeps closely in touch with his reader, who is permantly addressed in the second person singular imperative, often in the form of formulas such asUbi nota quod …(""At this point, note that …"").

The text was first printed in 1518, together with three otherdeclamationes, by Dirk Martens in Leuven. Another edition by Schürer in Strasburg, which contains theEncomium artis medicaeand theEncomium matrimonii, is from the same year (the link refers to this issue). Later, theEncomiawere often reprinted together. In the speech Erasmus represents medicine as the most beneficial of all sciences.

TheEncomiumis unusual in its form, as Mizauld does not write it in the default metre of elegiac couplets, but in the much more challenging lesser Asclepiads, a metre that is strongly associated with Horace’sOdes(cf. Hor.carm.1.1, 3.30, 4.8). However, while Horace’s odes in stichic lesser Asclepiads are short masterpieces of 16 to 36 verses, Mizauld extends his encomium to more than 270 stichic lesser Asclepiads. That Mizauld was conscious of his poetic feat might be indicated by the fact that the metre features prominently in the title of his poem (for another case of Mizauld using an unusual metre, cf. hisVita Orontii).The poem is construed on the premise that the lot of the astronomer is the best of all, a sentiment that is resurfaces throughout the poem as a sort of refrain. Through his engagement with the heavens, the astronomer is elevated above the other earth-dwellers and distances himself from their desire for ephemeral goods like riches. The astronomer looks down at the ridiculous behaviour of the other human beings from the heavens. Several panegyrical catalogues then enumerate what the astronomer knows and especially, what he is able to predict from the study of the heavens. Because of his expertise, the learned astronomer (in contrast to the bad astronomer) is part of Urania’s choir and dines with the gods.This (quite literal) superiority of the astronomer is of course an elaboration of a well-known topos in literary praises of astronomy (cf. Ovid'sFasti1.297–300 or Ptolemy's epigram andKepler's Latin renderingof it). In addition, Mizauld adopts the motif of the ""lebenswahl"" from the openingcarmenof Horace'sOdesin the same metre (where Horace chooses the life of the lyric poet, Mizauld chooses that of the astronomer). The early modern poet also pointedly adopts the concluding line of thecarmenin which the Horace'spersonaproclaims that if he will be counted among the lyrical poets, he will strike the stars with his head (sublimi feriam sidera vertice, Hor.carm.1.1.36) – a fitting motif for the astronomer.The solemn tone of the praise of the astronomer in the poem so far is achieved by rhetorical figures like anaphora, tricolon and rhetorical exclamations and by epic elements like similes (the astronomer is likened to an eagle that laughs at snails, flies and worms, and to the sun that outshines all other stars). On the other hand, polemical passages like the one likening humans who treasure ephemeral goods to goats and pigs (especially the Epicureans) provide a powerful foil that in turn hightens the effect of the astronomer's praise.In the last three pages, however, the poem takes a surprising turn, taking on a more playful and lively tone. Starting from the objection of afictus interlocutorthat the astronomer has no time for recreation at all, the poet elaborates that the variety of constellations offer endless possibilities for leisure like hunting (e.g. Leo), sword-fighting (with Orion), sailing (on the ship Argo), meeting heroes (e.g. Hercules and Perseus) and beautiful women (e.g. Andromeda and Cassiopeia) or engaging in celestial geometry. In this section, the poet addresses the reader constantly and envisions him as partaking in the manifold recreations that astronomy offers.At the end, the poem returns to the solemn tone of the first part and emphasizes the connection between the knowledge of the heavens and the knowledge about god, another well-established topos in literary praises of astronomy. In a ring-composition, Mizauld repeats his introductory words (in a slightly variated form) and thus concludes that the astronomer’s lot is truly the best of all.",,"Mizauld, Antoine‎(← links)Vita Orontii‎(← links)","Mizauld, Antoine:Encomium docti astronomi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Encomium_docti_astronomi(last revision: 21.01.2022).",,"MK, IT",Yes,IT,

It was one the first large-scale almanacs ever printed and the best work of this kind in its day. Its outstanding quality results from the fact that it was not only authored by the leading astronomer of its time, but also printed by him in his own printing shop. (For the mass of missprints that could distort the all-important figures in a work of this kind whose print was not overseen by the author in person, one may compare theHistoria coelestis.)As is customary with very early prints, the work bears no proper title, but to cite it asEphemeridesis justified by the first sentence, in which the treatment of a single year is called anephemeris:Usum ephemeridis cuiuslibet breviter exponemus(""I will briefly explain how any givenephemerisis to be used"").TheEphemeridesconsist almost entirely of charts. For each year, the twelve months are treated in as many tables which are spread over a double page each. On the left-hand page, the ecliptic longitude of the planets are given in degrees and minutes of the zodiacal signs in which they are situated for every single day of the respective month, while their aspects (conjunctions, oppositions etc.) are tabulated on the right-hand page. Each year is introduced by some essential information such as dates of major church holidays, eclipses, and periods of retrograde motion of the single planets.The only piece of running text, apart from the indication of the year and the printer in the explicit, is the untitled preface, which runs to two and a half pages and whose last half page is inserted after theephemerisof 1475. In it, Regiomontanus explains in simple, precise prose the structure of his tables and how they must be used, directly addressing the reader all the time for greater clarity and emphasis. The latter is even advised to underline certain parts in red for easier consultation (quas res si quis in textu numerorum promptius intueri cupiat, rubro lineamento locos regressionis notare poterit). The preface ends with a declaration of the work's usefulness for the construction of horoscopes and the determination of the right moment for medical treatments as well as for all other sorts of business. A short list of the astronomical symbols used and their meaning follows, while tables of the moon (tabellae lunae) and geographical regions said to follow at the end of the work are in fact lacking.The work proved highly successful. Over the last two decades, it was reissued many times in progressively reduced form, as the years that had already elapsed were left out. When crossing the Atlantic, Columbus is said to have used its data for location determination. Later, Regiomontanus'Ephemeridesbecame a model for new almanacs.","Zinner 1968, 185–189North 2013, 472Lawrence-Mathers 2020, 177–181","Regiomontanus, Johannes‎(← links)Almanach novum atque correctum super anno Domini 1510‎(← links)Haec opera‎(← links)","Regiomontanus, Johannes:Ephemerides, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ephemerides(last revision: 12.05.2022).",,"MK, FB",,MK,

The presentEphemerides from the Year of the Lord 1598 to the Year 1610represent the second edition, which currently is the earliest to be fully available online. Their letter of dedication to cardinal Antonio Maria Salviati indicates that the figures in the tables have been revised and the introductory part has been expanded. This introduction comprises four treatises which between them fill roughly half of the volume's 800 quarto pages. The second treatise, titledOn the Use of the Ephemerides(fols. 17v–143v), is of particular interest. It elucidates the form and content of Magini's tables and goes on to explain, with the help of numerous examples and additional tables, how to use them and which astrological ends they can serve. As advertised on the title page, an appendix, theCompendium directionum, presents a new method to facilitate some astronomical calculations.The scheme of theephemeridesproperly speaking is the same for every year. They start from a couple of pages providing general information on the year in question – among other things, its position in world chronology, its horoscope (calculated for the beginning of spring), the beginning of the astronomical seasons, the apogee of the single planets, the major church holidays, solar and lunar eclipses, and prograde and retrograde motions of the planets. After that, a double page is reserved for each month. The left page gives the longitude of all planets – that is, their position within the zodiac – for each day and their latitude for the first, 11th and 21th of the month.

Rather, observatories issued whole series of them for their respective meridian. The presentAstronomical Ephemerides of the year 1800 for the Meridian of Viennaprovides an impression of how this institutionalized variety of the genre looked like.The first characteristic that strikes the eye is the complex and compartmentalized structure of the book. In fact, theephemeridesproper only fill one fourth of it, as they are surrounded by a considerable number of other constituents. Apparently, the publication ofephemerideswas taken as an opportunity to publish various kinds of other astronomical information as well, which it would have been difficult to release as selfcontained books or journal articles. A table of contents listing only the most important constituents without taking their subsections into account reads as follows:Preface……pp. 1–2Errata in earlier issues, basic calendric data of the year 1800, occultations……pp. 2–8Ephemeridesproper, including diagrams of the positions of Jupiter’s moons for each month……pp. 9–104Phases of Venus for the first day of each month……p. 105Key figures of the solar system……pp. 106–107Catalogues of the fixed stars……pp. 108–44Varioustabulaefor astronomical observations and calculations……pp. 145–79Instructions for the use of theephemeridesandtabulaeand exercises, including a list of geographical features of the moon with an explanation of its use in the observation of lunar eclipses, in which reference is made to a lunar map at the end of the volume……pp. 180–256Table of contents for pp. 105–256……pp. 257–60The appendix announced in the full title, comprising three parts:I.

There, it is stated that the present issue has been elaborated according to the same principles as its predecessors, wherefore it would be unnecessary to detail the methods of calculation and the way in which the observational raw data were obtained once more (Quare supevacaneum hic existimamus de calculis nostris atque eorum fontibus, unde deducti sunt, uberiorem rationem reddere, p. 1).The section containing instructions and exercises should not be taken as evidence of the work addressing itself to beginners, but rather of its complexity, which made such guidance welcome even to experienced astronomers. Indeed, theEphemeridescater to an astronomical community whose members share considerable prior knowledge and speak a technical language which has long been fixated and is beyond dispute. Being fully classical in its grammer and nontechnical vocabulary, this language features a rich and precise technical terminology as well as a considerable number of abbreviations, astronomical symbols, and numerical data. The information density is correspondingly high.  A sentence likeDie 15 Oct. 0h0'19"" t.m. facta reductione ad observat. ascens. recta primi limbi Veneris observata in schola militari erat 203°59'45"" et distantia a vertice limbi super. 66°41'30""(p. 325)remains obscure to the uninitiated and becomes considerably longer, but still not fully clear, when all abbreviations and ellipses are resolved and spelled out in a translation:On the 15 October at 0 hours 0 minutes 19 seconds mean solar time (which has been reduced according to the position of the observatory), the right ascension of the first margin of Venus, observed at the military academy, was 205 degrees 59 minutes 45 seconds and the distance of the upper margin from the zenith, 66 degrees 41 minutes 30 seconds.",,"Triesnecker, Franz von Paula‎(← links)Bürg, Johann Tobias‎(← links)","Triesnecker, Franz von Paula; Bürg, Johann Tobias:Ephemerides astronomicae anni 1800 ad meridianum Vindobonensem, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ephemerides_astronomicae_anni_1800_ad_meridianum_Vindobonensem(last revision: 29.01.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

That domain was left to astrology and to the sub-scientific lore of weather signs. One of the few systematic works dedicated to this field is the presentPerpetual Calendar of the Airby the French astrologer and physician Antoine Mizauld.The tome, which comprises some 350 sedecimo pages, is called anenchiridiolum(""little handbook"", fol. 25r) by the author. It is introduced by a royal privilege for six years, a letter of dedication to Philibert Babou de La Bourdaisière, bishop of Angoulême (fols. 2r–3v), and an introduction titledProlegomena ad rerum naturae candidatosbut emphasizing the usefulness of the work not only for young naturalists, but for mankind at large (fols. 4r–27r, esp. 26v).  The prefatory section is concluded by a table of contents (fols. 27v–29r) and a list of sources (fol. 29v), which by the inclusion of authors as diverse as Aristotle and Virgil emphasizes the position of the field at the border of academic natural philosophy and folklore. At the end of the volume, one finds a poem of praise in iambic dimeters by the author's friend Petrus Bonnerius, a Greek epigram by a man called Νικόλαος Πείσων (fols. 170v–171r), and a bibliography of Mizauld's works, published as well as in progress (fols. 172r–175v; for a similar bibliographical appendix, see Johann Jakob Scheuchzer'sAcarnania).The main part (fols. 30r–169v) comprises five series of aphorisms, 845 in total, which focus on (1) rain and dryness, (2) dew, rime, fog, and darkness, (3) winds, (4) lightening and thunder, and (5) earthquakes respectively, but not to the exclusion of other phenomena. Each of these five sections is introduced by a short causal explanation of the respective phenomena and concluded by remarks about their character and the different forms they can take, a structure announced in theProlegomena(fol. 24r–v). The central part of each section is again subdivided according to the sources of the signs: they can come from the heavenly bodies, the air, the waters, and the earth, including the living beings inhabiting the three last elements. The aphorisms do not follow each other randomly, but are presented in good order. For example, the first 33 items on fols. 31r–36r are all dedicated to signs of rain proceeding from the sun. At the end of aphorism 33, Mizauld even inserts an explicit transition to the moon:Hactenus de sole: superest, ut ad lunam et stellas commode progrediamur.The single aphorisms can grow to considerable length, filling several pages. Mizauld does not aim at terseness and point, but this does not imply that his style is careless, quite the opposite. He writes a cultivated Latin and visibly strives to avoid the monotony to which the stringing together of numerous similar entries is prone to lead. The author shows himself particularly eager to find as many variants as possible for ""to predict, to indicate"". The aphorisms 38–47 on fols. 68v–69r, for instance, feature the expressionsostendunt, testatur, suffragium non denegabunt, habet testimonium, subscribit, praecones esse ducuntur, praesagire, nihil diversum exhibent, signum dare, andspondetto convey this recurring notion. Occasionally, the account is enlivened by an address to the reader, as in aphorism 44 on fol. 69r:Corvos sub nocturnum crepusculum gregatim versari si videbis et, dum separantur, summe crociendo dulces invisere nidos, idem quod antea praesagire existimabis.(""If you see ravens assemble together at nightfall and then, while parting, visit their nests with very loud cawing, you will estimate that they predict the same as before [namely dry weather]."")Remarks in theProlegomena(fols. 24v–25r) and in the appended autobibliography  help to clarify the work's publication history: a preliminary, shorter version appeared as early as 1546 under the titlePhaenomenaand was soon translated into French asLe mirouer du tempsorLe mirouer de l'air(1547, 1548).

The presentAlmanac Describing Sublunar Phenomena, elaborated for the region of Brabant by the physician, astronomer and astrologer Cornelis Gemma-Frisius from Leuven, provides an interesting example of this kind of literature. It focusses on the weather in the year ahead, but includes the health situation as well.The centre piece of the publication is a section comprising 48 pages, four per month, in which the following information is given and coordinated in six columns: 1) the single days of the month with their saints; 2) the weather; 3) human health and diseases; 4) the position of the moon in the zodiac; 5) explanations of the way in which the stars influence the atmosphere and thereby weather and health; 6) the positions of the planets. The layout is overseeable, enough space for the columns being provided by an unusual horizontal format. Red print is used to highlight important features. However, the copious use of abbreviations and astronomical symbols require an experienced reader. While most of the text is in key words only, columns 3 and 5 provide running text in full sentences. Column 5 is conceptually remarkable insofar as the author not only provides predictions, but also explains the rationale behind them. The beginning of January, for instance, is predicted to be particularly rainy for the following reason (planet symbols replaced by names):Saturnus vero, [Iupiter], [Venus] omnes circa imas epicyclorum absidas constituti maiori humiditate terras imbuunt.(""But Saturnus, Jupiter and Venus soak the earth with greater humidity, because all of them are located at the lowest points of their epicycles."")Although there is little in terms of the standard paratexts apart from the title page and a privilege by the Spanish king at the end, the central section of the publication is preceded and followed by numerous adjuncts. At the beginning, one finds some chronological key data of the year 1563, two descriptions and diagrams of a partial solar and a lunar eclipse, a short hexameter poem in which God rebukes humankind and threatens it with the impending doomsday, and an explanation of the astronomical symbols used. In the final part, the weather activity of the year ahead is briefly summarised month by month. A more general preview, not restricted to Brabant, is given, introduced by a defence of astrology against its critics. The Copernican system is presented (and apparently condemned) in an elegy. Finally, the correlation between the zodiacal signs and the parts of the human body is explained.Gemma-Frisius seems to have produced a whole series of similar almanacs. The 1561 and 1564 issues are recorded inPettegree; Walsby 2011(as no. 13097) and in a 19th century auction catalogue respectively.

The presentAlmanac of the Movements in the Sky 1829–1832, Calculated with Regard to the Meridian of Bolognaby the Bolognese professor Pietro Caturegli is a distinguished specimen of a vanishing species.The sober, untitled preface (pp. III–XII) starts from a sketch of the difficulties confronting authors of almanacs in Caturegli's day. Almanacs have to serve astronomers, geographers, and nautical scientists, whose demands are constantly growing as their disciplines evolve. It becomes more and more difficult to squeeze all the information that could and should be presented into a reasonable amount of space (pp. III–IV). This is followed by a quite detailed discussion of the relation between mean, true and sidereal time and of theAlmanac's policy in dealing with these issues (pp. V–IX). The final pages (pp. IX–XII) are dedicated to the make of the work in general and to its sources.Caturegli's tables present an immense amount of information. More than 300 pages, each of which contains around 350 figures and other data, easily amount to over 100,000 data in total. Nonetheless, the uniform and overseeable structure of the tables makes them convenient to use. The treatment of each year begins with some generic information. After that, every month is treated in exactly the same manner on six pages. The first page is titledChronometrica etc.and tabulates the abovementioned relation between the various kinds of time for each day. The second (Phaenomena) lists particular events like the occultation of stars and planets by the moon. The third page (Sol) informs about the position and apparent size of the sun. The fourth page (Planetae) is dedicated to the planets, including those recently discovered, namely Vesta, Iuno, Pallas, Ceres (classified as asteroids and a dwarf planet respectively today), and Uranus, the fifth and sixth pages (Luna) to the moon. The discussion of the four years is followed by some further tables dealing with the conversion of hours of mean, true and sidereal time and with the position of stars and planets in the context of their occultation by the moon (pp. 318–327). An appendix contains a short treatise on the calculation of occultations and solar eclipses (pp. I–XIX) plus eleven more tables providing data necessary to this end.If Caturegli's work is advanced and highly technical regarding its astronomical content, it is a testimony to 19th century classicism in terms of its Latinity. His instructions in the preface use classical vocabulary as far as possible and are partly even written in Ciceronian periods, which starkly contrast with the respective topics (p. IX):Si conversiones, de quibus superius egimus, ad loca pertinent, quorum longitudo a Bononiae longitudine discrepet, meridiani differentia in tempus expressa ea ipsa erit impendenda ratione, quam, ubi de conversionibus veri temporis in medium et e contra actum a nobis est, explicavimus.""If the conversions which I have discussed above pertain to places whose longitude differs from that of Bologna, the difference of the meridian, expressed in time, has to be taken into account exactly in the manner which I explained in the passage where the conversion of true into mean time and vice versa was discussed by me.""",,"Caturegli, Pietro‎(← links)","Caturegli, Pietro:Ephemerides motuum caelestium ex anno 1829 in annum 1832, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ephemerides_motuum_caelestium_ex_anno_1829_in_annum_1832(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Historia et observationes anni 1781(Google Books),808353,"Founded in 1780 by the Elector of the Palatinate Charles Theodore, theSocietas Meteorologica Palatinawas the first institutional body ever to conduct systematical and precise meteorological observations on an international level through a network of observers based in many European countries and beyond (Feldman 1990, 168–73). Due to the death of their first secretary and mastermind Johann Jakob Hemmer in 1790 as well as to political adversities, theSocietasceased to exist in 1795.The observations conducted from 1781 to 1792 were published in theYearbooks of the Meteorological Society of the Palatinate. Twelve massive folio volumes appeared between 1783 and 1795. Each of them comprises some 400 pages and contains around 200,000 observational data. The present volume, the very first one, in addition features a good deal of prefatory matter, presumably authored by Hemmer. The tome is introduced by a dedication to Charles Theodor and a preface apologizing for its delayed publication and various shortcomings. (Among the reasons for the delay was alsovariorum scriptorum in linguam Latinam traductio, the need to translate vernacular texts sent in by the contributors into Latin; see fol. )(3r). TheHistoriamentioned in the title narrates the foundation of theSocietasand explains its purpose and principles (pp. 1–54). Many documents, partly translated from German, are quoted in the process; the accurate guidelines for the observers (pp. 8–17) are of particular interest. Another long section (pp. 55–90) is dedicated to the description of various meteorological instruments (baro-, thermo-, hygrometer etc.) manufactured in Mannheim. Some of them have been sent out to all observers in order to guarantee the comparability of their observations. The complicated apparatuses are delineated and their functionality is explained with impressive skill. (Unfortunately, the corresponding illustrations are missing in the present electronic copy.)The greatest part of the volume is taken up by theephemeridesproper from the different places of observation. They are introduced in each case by some remarks on the nature of the respective location (including sometimes a few botanical and medical remarks), the observatory and the instruments available. The responsible observer is always mentioned by name. The observations themselves are presented in the form of tables containing up to 16 columns. These columns inform about 1. date, 2. hours of observation (usually 7 a.m., 2 p.m., 9 p.m.), 3. air pressure, 4. and 5. temperature (the relationship between the two respective columns is unclear), 6. humidity, 7. declination of the compass needle, 8. wind, 9. amount of rainfall or snowfall, 10. evaporation, 11. water level of the local river, 12. phase and position of the moon, 13. cloudage, 14. precipitations, 15. and 16 any further observations (see § XI of the guidelines, pp. 12–13). In most cases, however, some columns are left blank for lack of data.TheYearbooksprovide an interesting example of how the astronomical and astrological genre of theephemeridescould be adapted to another discipline and how their character changed in the process. While the tabular format was kept, the kind of information provided was modified. This is evident at one glance, since the astronomical symbols prominent in normalephemerideshave been replaced by newly invented meteorological ones for phenomena such as overcast sky, fog, rain or snow (see § IX of the guidelines, p. 11). More fundamentally, instead of making predictions regarding the future, theephemerideshave become a means to present information about the recent past.",,Societas Meteorologica Palatina‎(← links),"Societas Meteorologica Palatina:Ephemerides Societatis Meteorologicae Palatinae.

The anatomical textbook, which was published originally in German, went through many editions and translations (including aLatinand a Japanese translation) and became one of the most influential works of its kind in the 18th century (cf.Döhler et al. 2020).However, as a member of early modern learned culture, Kulmus had also learned to write Latin verses, and he employed his poetic skills to present and comment on his own anatomical practice. Thus, in the preface of Kulmus's short monograph on the dissection of a pair of conjoint twins from Danzig, we find a epigram of seven elegiac couplets. Kulmus introduces these verses by stating that he wrote them during his anatomical studies, and that they essentially provide a summary of his observations:Plurimas in hoc monstro observatas difformitates praesentes versiculi continent, quos inter labores anatomicos nuper exaraveram(""The present little verses, which I recently had composed during my anatomical work, contain most of the deformities which I observed in this monster."").Indeed, Kulmus provides a detailed and precise description of the conjoint twins in the little space of the epigram. In the first two couplets, he relates the circumstances of the birth of the ""monster"": it was born dead; the mother died giving birth; it was her fifth child after four healthy children. The third to sixth couplet then delve into the description: the two girls, who are an ell (ca. 1/2 m) tall, are joined at the breast and share one umbilical cord; they share one liver, but have two gallbladders; their crooked breastbone is joined to the ribs by one diaphragm; they share one heart that has three ventricles and four auricles. In the seventh couplet, the epigram ends, as is typical for the genre, with a pointe: the dissection shows that the two girls are quite literallycon-cordes(""one heart and one soul""). In a footnote, Kulmus adds another layer to the pointe, as he claims to have dissected the twins' heart on the Day of Saint Concordia.Compared to other epigrams in this database, which reflect on anatomy in more general terms (cf. Caspar Barlaeus'sepigram on the anatomical theatre of Amsterdamand Arthur Johnston'sepigram on a dissection he had witnessed in Padua), the present epigram stands out because of its richness in detail, its didactic streak and not least the fact that here, we have the anatomist himself presenting a concrete insight into his work. Kulmus combines the characteristics of the epigram, such as shortness, pointed contrasts and wordplay, with a detailed ekphrasis of the twins' anatomy. Considering that the anatomst had identified himself as the poet in the preface, it is notable that there is no first-person narrative in the epigram: even the act of dissection is described in passive voice. Printed, as it is, in the paratext, the role of the epigram is to provide an overview of the monograph in an attractive format, but also to arouse the readers' interest and to motivate them to continue reading.",Döhler et al. 2020,"Kulmus, Johann Adam‎(← links)Corpore monstrosus foetus Gedani generatus(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Kulmus, Johann Adam:Epigram on Conjoint Twins, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epigram_on_Conjoint_Twins(last revision: 20.01.2022).",,,Yes,IT,

The letter was printed in Eustachi’sOpuscula anatomicain 1564, where it is 17 pages long (p. 148–164).In the long introduction (p. 148–152), Eustachi praises his addressee Francesco Alciati and expresses his obligation towards him, as Alciati defended him when ill-wishers tried to alienate him from Cardinal Borromeo. In return, Eustachi thanks Alciati by presenting his new discoveries about the ear in a letter to him. Eustachi  expects this letter to motivate other readers to dedicate themselves to anatomical studies. Turning to his topic, Eustachi first relates the history of the research of the ear, especially the discovery of the three ossicles (p. 152–154), and argues againstVesalius(p. 154–157). He then presents his own dissections of the internal ear and his discoveries (p. 157–164). In the short close of the letter, Eustachi interprets the complicated process of hearing revealed through anatomy as a divine reminder not to agree to what others say without thinking, which is precisely the virtue that Alciati has demonstrated in the case of Eustachi (p. 164).The letter is a testament to the humanist ideal of Latin writing, composed in elegant Ciceronian periods and following the conventions of the epistolary genre. Although on the surface, the letter is addressed to Alciati, when writing about his dissections, Eustachi speaks to his fellow anatomists, as is clear from the fact that he presents his operations in the form of instructions.In 1707, Eustachi'sOpuscula anatomica, including theEpistula de auditus organis, were republished in Leiden byHerman Boerhaave.

Ad praeclarissimum virum doctum Joannem Raium,"Lithophylacii Britannici ichnographia, 131–45",1699,London,Officina M.C.,17th century,"Monograph, Letter",Meteorology/Earth sciences,Epistola de fossilium marinorum origine ad Joannem Raium(e-rara.ch),597675,"Appended to Edward Lhuyd'sLithophylacii Britannici ichnographia, one finds six letters by the author to various friends and colleagues. The last and longest one is dated Catterick, 29 July 1698 and addressed to the naturalist, classicist and theologianJohn Ray(1627–1705). In terms of form and content, it looks like a short monograph discussing one specific aspect of the more general topic treated in the format of a natural history in the main part of the book – England's fossils.As often in (esp. published) learned correspondence, the letter goes straightin medias resand is styled as an answer to a specific question from the addressee. The very first sentence reads:Rogas, vir insignissime, quid mihi tandem post aliquot annorum experientiam de marinorum corporum, quae e subterraneis eruimus, et mineralium foliorum ortu coniciendum videatur.(""You ask, most famous sir, what I, basing myself on several years of experience, think that one should assume concerning the bodies of sea animals which we dig out from the earth, and of petrified leaves."") The rest of the letter answers this question in quite systematic manner. First, Lhuyd ponders and rejects the idea that the respective phenomena are remnants of the Great Flood, enumerating nine arguments against this hypothesis for the sea animals and and seven for the leaves (pp. 132–36, 137–38). A second thesis, which makes avis plastica(""formative power"") of the earth itself responsible, is refused more briefly (p. 138). After that, Lhuyd exposes his own, novel explanation: exhalations rife with invisible animal and plant sperms enter the earth and impregnate it (pp. 138–39). This idea is backed up by another list of five pro arguments, followed by ten objections and Lhuyd's responses to the latter (pp. 139–42, 142–43, 143–45).From the beginning, quoted above, Lhuyd behaves as an authority in the field. He maintains this position throughout the letter by occasionally remembering the reader of his vast collection of fossils, cataloguized in the very book to which the letter is appended. However, the authority Lhuyd claims for himself is coupled with a modest and scrupulous attitude. Lhyud presents himself as willing to list every conceivable argument, even those militating against him, in order to come closer to truth. At one point, he even confesses to have no answer (fateor me nihil habere quod respondeam, p. 144) to the argument that some fish teeth dug from the ground show traces of abrasion, which proves that they once belonged to living individuals (although he half-heartedly takes back this confession in the following). In the letter's final sentences, Lhuyd invites Ray to form his own judgement (tuo visum est arbitrio sistere) and proclaims not to care whether his position will be accepted or refuted, as long as either reaction helps to approach to truth:Perinde enim nobis est, dummodo erudito orbi exoptatissima quoquomodo tandem elucescat veritas.If Ray (or other readers, for that matter) let himself be convinced by Lhuyd's explanation, we do not know. Following Robert Hooke, Ray understood fossils a remnants of living plants and animals in principle, but he never was quite sure of this and always open for new ideas. He may have appropriated at least one of Lhuyd's arguments against the Flood thesis, namely the lack of land animals in the fossil record (p. 134; seePoole 2010, 130–33, esp. 132).In terms of style, Lhuyd's Latin is clear and easy to understand, apart from the frequent names of various maritime animals and a very high number of misprints. It is worth noting that the termfossilia(literally just ""things that can be dug out"") is already used in its modern meaning ""fossils"".",,"Lhuyd, Edward‎(← links)","Lhuyd, Edward:Epistola de fossilium marinorum origine ad Joannem Raium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epistola_de_fossilium_marinorum_origine_ad_Joannem_Raium(last revision: 23.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The letter was in Spanish, and in this form it was first printed in Barcelona a few weeks later, addressed to the courtier Luis de Santángel who had done much to make Colombo's voyage possible. However, both this and a somewhat later Spanish edition were little read at the time and resurfaced only in the 19th century in one single copy each. It was the Latin translation of the letter by the otherwise rather unknown humanist Leander de Cosco that made Colombo's discovery known throughout Europe. Finished on 29 April 1493 and first printed in Rome on 14 May, it was reprinted half a dozen times, partly with illustrations, during the same and the following year, and served as the base text for several Italian and German translations over the next few years.The text of the Latin version, titledLetter about the Recently Discovered Islands Belonging to India beyond the Ganges, fills six quarto pages in the present digital copy (which reproduces a corrected reissue of the first edition published by the same printer a few months later). Passing over his crossing of the Atlantic in one sentence, Colombo narrates in some detail his movements in the Carribean. Above all, he describes the islands discovered by him, which he thinks to belong to eastern Asia, emphasizing their size and fertility and depicting their population as primitive and harmless. He shows himself enthused about the chance of making them loyal subjects of the Spanish Crown and converting them to Christianity. The letter styles the expedition as a great success in order to justify the remarkable investment made by the Crown. It is a rhetorical text, and as everything else in it, Colombo's remarks about the natural conditions of the newly discovered islands serve a persuasive goal. Harking back to the techniques of ancient chorography (just as the descriptions of the natives hark back to ancient ethnography), they aim at creating an impression of immediacy and precision. Colombo gives exact numbers for the extension of the various islands and the distances between them. He describes their landscape (mountains, woods, fields, rivers), vegetation (""seven or eight kinds of palms"" growing on Cuba, [p. 2]), climate (November there is like May in Spain, the sun is very strong, [pp. 2, 5]) and mineral deposits (gold and other metals on Hispaniola, [p. 2]). The northern latitude of the islands is also given as 26° ([p. 5]). Finally, the title of the Latin version lends the text a scientific air by embedding it in the Ptolemaic tradition, whereIndia supra Gangemappears as a technical term for southeastern Asia.This addition to the untitled Spanish original is not the only change made in the Latin translation, which deviates from its template both at the beginning and the end: Not Santángel, but Gabriel Sanchez, the treasurer of the Crown of Aragón, is named as the addressee in the full title (while the letter itself begins without an address). Colombo's explanations regarding the circumstances of composition and dispatch, with which the original version concludes, are omitted.In terms of translation technique and style, Cosco is generally faithful to Colombo's Spanish. He writes a more or less classicising Latin. In his desire to enhance the marvelous aspects of the newly discovered islands, he peppers his account with a plethora of superlatives. Occasionally, he even resorts to poetical forms of expression. On [p. 2], for instance, he speeks of ""an immense variety of trees licking the stars"" (maxima arborum varietate sidera lambentium) and has ""philomela [the nightingale] chatter"" (garriebat philomela).","Wallisch 2000(Introduction, Latin text, German translation; with an appendix reproducing the Spanish original)For an overview of the abundant literature on Colombo's letter in general, see the references in the English Wikipedia articleColumbus's letter on the first voyage.","Colombo, Cristoforo‎(← links)Cosco, Leander de‎(← links)","Colombo, Cristoforo; Cosco, Leander de:Epistola de insulis Indiae supra Gangem nuper inventis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epistola_de_insulis_Indiae_supra_Gangem_nuper_inventis(last revision: 19.10.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Although a medieval work first only surviving in manuscript form, the printed version of the text became much more widely known and inspired many early modern scientists still working on similar questions in the 16th and 17th centuries. The work was issued by the physician and astrologer Achilles Gasser and dedicated to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I.Peregrinus’ letter to an otherwise unknown Sygerius de Foncaucourt is introduced by a 12-page preface written by Gasser, which includes a brief history of scholarship on magnetism from antiquity to his day, as well as deliberations on the benefits of magnetic devices for navigation and more. Peregrinus' monograph, styled as a letter, is divided into two parts, the first containing ten chapters, the second three. Part one is theoretical, presenting laws of magnetic attraction, the polarity of the lodestone and every magnet, for the first time calledpolus, experiments with separated lodestones, which still show north and south poles, the attraction and magnetization of iron with lodestones and more. Part two is more practical, presenting three devices using magnetic attraction – the compass floating on water used at the time, an alternative compass without the use of water, as well as aperpetuum mobile, which gained the interest of many scholars. 
Gasser equipped the work with the preface, a short introduction to the structure and content of the work, subchapters with titles, as well as illustrations of the devices presented in the second part.

According to legend, it had been a field of actual melons in the past, but the fruits were turned into stones when the farmer refused to give one of them to the prophet Elijah. Some of these curious melon stones found their way into natural-historical collections, where they could be examined and studied in detail. Johann Philipp Breyn wrote hisEpistula de melonibus petrefactis montis Carmel vulgo creditis(Letter On What Are Commonly Believed To Be The Petrified Melons Of Mount Carmel) on the basis of two specimens from the museum of Johann Anderson, who is the addressee of the scientific letter. In the letter, Breyn argues that the melon stones were not in fact petrified melons, but actual stones which only resembled melons. In the printed version, the 23-page letter is dated Danzig, 2nd December 1721. It was published in 1722 together with two other recent, but shorter scientific letters which were not written by, but addressed to Breyn. The letter is illustrated with two engravings.TheEpistula de melonibus petrefactisfollows a clear structure. It starts with a long address to Anderson, in which the addressee is characterised and praised and the occasion of the letter is introduced (p. 1–6). The text then turns to the topic in question, Mount Carmel and its „field of melons“, and presents a history of reports on the melon stones (p. 6–11). It then describes the melon stones in some detail and demonstrates that they must be stones, not petrified fruits (p. 11–16). The letter devotes space to a few parallel cases like petrified chickpeas (p. 16–23) and ends in a short valediction (p. 23).While the framework of the text follows the rules of letter writing, the scientific centrepiece resembles a dissertation or a passage of a monograph. The addressee seems to disappear from the picture, and the text is full of quotations from Latin and vernacular sources (sometimes over a page long) and furnished with footnotes.

In his last years, when Haller endeavoured to edit a selection of letters addressed to him by thecrème de la crèmeof the scientific community, he logically started with the Latin ones. They constituted the first part of the projected corpus and the only one he lived to finish.The six volumes of theEpistulae Latinaecontain 1004 letters (670 in vols. I–III, 334 in vols. IV–VI). Most of them are by well-known scholars such asLinnaeus,Johann Jakob Scheuchzer,Georg GmelinandCaspar Friedrich Wolff, as the reader can see at one glance from the index of correspondents at the begin of every volume. The letters are arranged in chronological order and cover the years 1727–1774. They mostly deal with botany, medicine and anatomy.The first volume contains a short preface, in which Haller explains the collection's rationale and his own editorial principles. The letters from the years 1723–1727, that is, from Haller's 16th to 20th year, have been left outin totoas juvenile products. Among the rest, only those have been selected that contain something of public interest and usefulness (as Haller puts it,quae mihi videbantur publice utiles fore). Even in the latter, however, passages of only personal interest have been deleted, except if they were so intervowen with more important contents that excision proved impossible (as in the case of some laudatory passages, for which Haller begs his reader's excuse). Regarding content, the reader is asked to take scientific progress into account and not to judge the older letters too severly. Linnaeus, with whom Haller had quarelled about a number of scientific matters, is singled out for special mention. In his letters, even bad style and slips of the pen have been left unaltered – which implies that the rest of the letters has been edited also in terms of style. Haller's own letters are unfortunately no longer available to him, since he has kept no copies. Letters of different languages are edited separately according to the wish of the publisher. After the Latin letters, the French, German, English and Italian ones will follow (a promise Haller was unable to keep, as already mentioned). Finally, Haller adds a couple of autobiographical notes that are relevant to the understanding of the letters.","Boschung et al. 2002Stuber et al. 2005Korenjak 2016, 159–162","Haller, Albrecht von‎(← links)Epistolarum ab eruditis viris ad Albertum Hallerum scriptarum pars 1.

The publication should have run to several volumes, as transpires from the full title of the present volume:The Books of Astronomical Letters of Tycho Brahe the Dane, of Which This Is the First. In the end, however, this volume remained the only one to appear in print.TheEpistolae astronomicae, a collection of some 350 quarto pages, all in all, contain Tycho's correspondence with William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, a passionate observer of the stars himself who owned the only other observatory comparable to Uraniborg at the time, and his court astronomer Christoph Rothmann. The text of the letters is supplemented by tables, diagrams, poems, and comments by Brahe. Occasional letters by others such as Brahe's friend Heinrich Rantzau can be found as well. Those of Wilhelm's and Brahe's epistles which were originally written in German or a mixture of German and Latin are given in the original and in a Latin translation. Moreover, the edition features a rich paratextual apparatus. It is introduced by several poems in praise of Tycho, a letter by Tycho to Wilhelm's son and heir Moritz, a preface to the reader explaining the whole publication endeavor and the present volume in particular, and a letter by Heinrich Rantzau, dated as early as January 1587, in which Rantzau asks Brahe to publish his correspondence. Inserted after two-thirds of the volume (pp. 219–264) one finds an extensive description of Uraniborg and of Brahe's instruments there, including some poems with which he had decorated the rooms along with plans and drawings of the buildings. Part of the letters following upon this description is not addressed to Wilhelm (who had died in 1592) anymore but to Moritz. The concluding piece is again a poem, a funerary elegy on Wilhelm by Brahe.No justice can be done here to the richness and complexity of this edition in terms of astronomical content and literary form. The reader is referred toMosley 2002, who inter alia shows that Brahe presumably was contemplating publication already at the time when he wrote and dispatched the originals and that part of the work's purpose was to show that his observational data were confirmed by those obtained at Kassel. In terms of language, the Latin letters look quite technical in places, featuring numerous indications of degrees and minutes as well as astronomical symbols. On the whole, however, they are nonetheless characterized by careful polish rather than epistolary simplicity. Brahe himself in particular seems eager to do justice to the Landgrave's high rank by addressing him in carefully labored periods. To this stylistic luster, the language mix of the German-Latin letters forms a curious contrast. The following passage from a letter by Wilhelm to Brahe, sent on the 20 October 1585, in which German, Latin, and Latin loan words with German endings alternate in the smallest of spaces, is typical of the intense code-switching that characterizes these letters. The sentence, which translates into English as""My astronomer CHRISTOPH ROTHMANN has written to me that he had observed a small comet on the 8th of this month at 9 p.m. at 23°15' of Pisces and at a southern latitude of 14°0' and on the 9th of the same month at 25°50' of Pisces and at a southern latitude of 13°6'.""reads as follows in the original (p. 3):Nuhn hat uns unserMathematicus CHRISTOPHORUS ROTHMANNUSzugeschrieben/dz er einen kleinenCometenuff den8 huius, Abends umb 9 uhrin 23 grad(ibus) 15 minut(is) piscium cum Latitud(ine) merid(ionali) 14 grad(uum) 0 min(utarum), Und uff den9 eiusdem in 25 grad(ibus) 50 min(utis) piscium cum latitud(ine) merid(ionali) 13 grad(uum) & 6 min(utarum) observiret.However, Brahe presumably had the originals printed mainly to guarantee the authenticity of the material presented by him.

Eiusdem annotationes in Antonii Musae Brasavolae simplicium medicamentorum examen. Cum duplici indice, quorum alter Epistolarum argumenta, alter vero rerum et vocum toto opere memorabilium seriem complectitur",,1543,Basel,Isengrin,16th century,"Monograph, Letter, Other (see description)","Biology, Medicine",Epistolae medicinales(e-rara.ch),608638,"Among the many letter collections published by early modern men of science, miscellanies of medical letters were especially high in number.Epistolae medicinalesbecame a kind of standard title for such publications from the first decades of the 16th century onwards.A comparatively early example comes from the pen of Luigi Mondella, professor of medicine and botany at the University of Padua. On more than 260 quarto pages, it contains 24 letters, whose length ranges from one to some dozen pages. Only the last letter, addressed to Antonio Musa Brassavola and commenting on hisExamen omnium simplicium(Rome 1536) stands apart and is separately mentioned on the title page, as it runs to a full 85 pages. The letters are (or purport to be) written between 1537 and 1542 but are not presented in strictly chronological order. Rather, Mondella follows literary principles such as anular composition (letters 1 and 23 are both addressed to the most prestigious addressee,Girolamo Fracastoro) and variety. Indeed, the collection is decidedly diverse in form and content. The table of contents inserted between the short and rather vacuous address to the reader and the extensive index provides a good overview. Many letters are short monographs. Others comment on passages from medical classics both ancient and modern, particularly on Galen, who is already mentioned in the full title.  Others again look more like everyday letters in that they touch on a variety of topics. There is also a case report and aconsilium(letters 18, 20). The subjects discussed range from the medical uses of smaragds and the identity of the bird calledcoturnixby classical authors to the question whether febrile people should be given wine and to cures for hardness of hearing (letters 1, 6, 14, 20). Most of the addressees are Italian physicians like Mondella himself, including his Paduan colleagues (e.g. letter 6). In addition, the author also writes to a German physician and botanist (Leonhart Fuchs, letter 14), to philosophers, noblemen and members of the clergy (e.g. letters 2, 18, 20). The tone towards the addressees is friendly, but harsh attacks on third parties are rather common. Mondella and his correspondents appear to form an island of culture and rationality in a medical world dominated by ignorance, arrogance and avarice.In terms of epistolary style, most letters begin without a proper address. Instead, they bear a title identifying the addressee and the topic discussed. By contrast, all letters conclude with avaledictioand the respective date. Mondella writes a polished, impeccable Latin. His long periods equally contrast with the carelessness of real-life letters and the studied casualness of ancient classics of the epistolary genre such as the younger Pliny. Mondella applies this style to any subject whatsoever, no matter how mundane. Letter 8, which is concerned with frog leg soup, begins (p. 77):Memini me alias tibi quam certissime affirmasse ex auctoritate antiquorum scriptorum ranarum ius ranasque ipsas sumptas iis mirifice opitulari, qui a venenatis percussi essent reptilibus, proptereaque nulli a ratione alienum videri <debere>, si ranarum usus in cibis nostris temporibus apud multas, Italia praesertim, nationes frequens sit …(""I remember that I once, based on the authority of the ancient writers, asserted to you with the greatest conviction that the consumption of frog leg soup and frogs themselves is of wonderful help to those who have been bitten by venomous crawlers, wherefore it must not appear unreasonable to anyone that in our days, frogs are often used as ingredients of dishes by many populations, especially in Italy …"") And this is only the first half of the opening period! If Mondella'sEpistolae medicinaleswere really sent to their addressees at all, they must have been either written with publication in mind from the very beginning or heavily edited for publication.",,"Mondella, Luigi‎(← links)","Mondella, Luigi:Epistolae medicinales, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epistolae_medicinales(last revision: 02.03.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

At least 21 collections, often titled preciselyEpistolae medicinales, appeared between 1521 and 1626 (Maclean 2008, 29–30). One of the first and most successful of these publications were Giovanni Manardi'sMedical Letters, in Which Many Errors of More Recent Doctors Are Exposed and the Rules of the Ancient Explained. They were frequently republished and incorporated into more extensive collections over the 16th century.The book begins with an extensive table of contents, in which each letter is summerarised, and a list of errata. Each of the following six books contains five or six letters. Between them, they cover 72 quarto folia. There is no formal dedication or preface, but the first letter, addressed to Floriano Montino, serves as a substitute for the former. In it, Manardi defends his apparently novel idea of publishing  a collection of letters against potential critics with the need to correct the innumerous errors to be found in the medical (esp. Arabic) tradition, of which he adduces a fair number of examples. He also names a few ancient writers who are said to have published (lost) collections of medical letters. Moreover, letters are said to be a natural way of answering the requests of friends, which Manardi receives in great numbers. He concedes that his Latin is mediocre, because he lacked good teachers in that language, butnec Latinam linguam discere sed medicinam cupientibus haec scripta sunt(fol. 2v; ""these letters have been written for those who want to learn, not Latin, but medicine""). The last letter (6.6), on the other hand, is addressed to the reader. Manardi explains that he has many more letters ready for publication and in mysterious terms blames a bookseller (librarius) for the fact that these have to remain unpublished for the moment. At the same time, he implies that the volume is perfect as it is by calling the number of its books and of the chapters of the last bookhic numerus mysticus senarius, primus inter perfectos(""this mystical number six, the first perfect number"").The remaining letters are addressed to friends and colleagues as well as to members of the nobility and the high clergy. They begin without a proper epistolary address. Instead, the correspondent's name and the topic discussed are given in a title. Most letters conclude with a simpleVale(""Farewell""); in some cases, a date and a place are added. The epistles are written in plain, grammatically correct Latin, although they are full of technical terms. Throughout the collection, Manardi appears as a benign authority, always eager to help those who seek his advice. The letters discuss a great variety of topics (often prompted by a question of the addressee) and belong to several epistolary subgenres. Some of them debate philological problems in classical authors such as Hippocrates and Avicenna (e.g. epist. 1.2, 4.2, 6.5). Others are concerned with the identification and characterisation of herbs and drugs (1.3, 1.4, 1.5), with parts of the body such as the stomach (2.3), parasites such as tapeworms (3.1, 4.1), and certain treatments such as bloodletting (5.1). There is even a short compendium of the whole of medicine (4.3). A number of letters can be called medicalconsilia. They are partly dedicated to somatic diseases such as the plague (5.3) or fever and constipation (5.4), partly to psychological problems (nightmares, 3.2, 3.3; melancholy, 4.4). One letter is a report on the causes of a case of death (6.1). Once, Manardi interferes in an ongoing medical polemic (2.1).The great thematic and formal variety of the collection presumably was among the reasons of its success. It also seems to testify, together with the careful framing by epist. 1.1 and 6.6 and a number of internal correlations (for example the thematic link between the opening letters of books 3 and 4), to certain literary ambitions on Manardi's part. Perhaps, he intended to create something like a modern equivalent to the letters of Pliny the Younger in the field of medicine.",,"Manardi, Giovanni‎(← links)De erroribus Symonis Pistoris‎(← links)","Manardi, Giovanni:Epistolae medicinales, in quibus multa recentiorum errata et antiquorum decreta reserantur, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epistolae_medicinales,_in_quibus_multa_recentiorum_errata_et_antiquorum_decreta_reserantur(last revision: 03.05.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Such 'paper inscriptions', so-calledellogia, are a popular format in baroque Latinity (Tilg 2019). Like the real stone inscriptions which they imitate, they are always printed in capitals in order to create a monumental impression, and just as their models, they stand somewhere between poetry and prose. Their layout, which reproduces their syntactic structure in a series of short, centered lines, reminds the reader of a poem, but they are not strictly speaking metrical.The present example comprises 33 lines without the title. It praises Galilei's sharp intellect and inventiveness in general, hails his discovery of the moons of Jupiter and explains that he sacrificed his eyesight (which he lost in 1638, perhaps as a result of too much sungazing) for the best of mankind. Galilei and his findings have found a place in the sky. Although he died at the ripe age of 78, his death must be considered premature, because he still was full of novel ideas.The style is typical of the genre. The diction is fully classical and elevated. Hyperbolical formulations abound. That Galilei detected four moons circling Jupiter is expressed in the words ""He amplified the provinces of heaven and made the Universe increase"" (CAELORUM PROVINCIAS AUXIT / ET UNIVERSO DEDIT INCREMENTUM, ll. 6–7). The syntax is characterized by extensive periods. Relative clauses introduced byQUIandCUIUSat the beginning of a line (ll. 4, 11, 18, 21) are used as a structuring device. Finite verb forms are usually placed at the end of a line, which sometimes results in rimes (e.g. ll. 8 and 10:CONFLAVIT – DEDICAVIT). A leitmotif is provided by the paradox contrast between Galilei's blindness and his mental clairvoyance: He is introduced as ""truly Lyncean"" (VERE LYNCEO, l. 1) in allusion to his membership in the Accademia dei Lincei, but above all to the legendary sharp-sightedness of the academy's namesake, the mythical Lynceus. Already in the next line, however, Galilei is called the ""Oedipus of Nature"" (NATURAE OEDIPO), a phrase that hints at Oedipus' fame as the smartest man of his time as well as to the fact that he blinded himself. A little later, an entire period of seven lines (ll. 11–17) is used to explain that Galilei (in contrast to Oedipus) considerately sacrificed his eyes in order to let mankind see the truth. However, his mental vision remained unimpaired and he dedicated himself to ""new contemplations"" (NOVIS COMTEMPLATIONIBUS, l. 25) until his death.Early modern times can be said to have invented scientific stardom in the sense that a handful of contemporary or recently deceased thinkers, men like Tycho Brahe or Isaac Newton (seeNewton's epitaph;Epitaphium in Newtonum), came to enjoy Europe-wide fame and to be venerated as superhuman heroes of science. The present text shows that Galilei definitely was a member of this exclusive club by the end of the 17th century.",,Systema cosmicum‎(← links)Anonymus 10‎(← links),"Anonymus 10:Epitaphium Galilaei, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epitaphium_Galilaei(last revision: 21.01.2022).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

It is dedicated to cardinal Bessarion, who apparently prompted its composition. The former Greek bishop Bessarion is also the one who drew Peuerbach's and thus also Regiomontanus' attention to the direct translation of antique original works liberating them from medieval corruptions or comments (cf.Hamann 1980, 30). Between the letter of dedication and the main text, an epigram to the reader and a woodcut showing Ptolemy and Regiomontanus in front of a schematic representation of the universe are inserted.Books 1-6 are mainly written by Peuerbach and books 7-13 by Regiomontanus (Zinner 1968, 79–86). The work is based on a medieval abbrevitated version of theAlmagestbut goes far beyond it (North 2013, 472). It constitutes not merely a shortened translation but a revised edition in Latin of the ancient original. This revision consists of a refurbishment of spherical geometry in the language of spherical trigonometry (especially using sines and the spherical laws of sines and cosines) which had been developed in medieval Islam and by Regiomontanus himself (cf.De triangulis omnimodis). But also some methods for astronomic measurements are criticized: In proposition XIV of book 3 the authors present a more accurate and general form for the determination of the sun's apogee (Hartner 1980, 124). Also, the epicycle theory for the moon is questioned because, as they note in propostition XXII of book 5, the size of the moon disk on the sky must vary by the factor four (quadrupla opportet apparere ad magnitudinem suam) if the huge distance differences to the earth caused by the epicycle model are taken into consideration. In the beginning of book 12, of theEpitoma, Regiomontanus notes and proves that epicycle and eccenter models are geometrically equivalent not only for the superiour planets (as Ptolemy claims) but also the inferior ones (which Ptolemy denied). Describing the motion of planets by the eccentric model finally paved the way for theCopernican Revolutionand the heliocentric model (cf.Shank 2007, pp. 336-337).A second edition appeared at Basel in 1543. It is furnished with an additional letter of dedication by the editor, the humanist and physician Hieronymus Gemusaeus, to an Alsatian noble and with a copious index, while the abovementioned epigram and the woodcut have gone. After that, the work went through numerous further editions under slightly different titles and became ""the standard textbook in advanced astronomy for the whole of the sixteenth century"" (Wootton 2015, 187). Among its most famous readers were Copernicus and Galilei. TheEpitoma's critical comments about some weaknesses of the Ptolemaic model presumably helped to motivate the former to think about possible alternatives.","Zinner 1968, 79-86Hamann 1980Hartner 1980Shank 2007","Regiomontanus, Johannes‎(← links)Peuerbach, Georg von‎(← links)Defensio Theonis‎(← links)Ptolemaei Almagestum Latina donatum lingua‎(← links)","Regiomontanus, Johannes; Peuerbach, Georg von:Epitoma in Almagestum Ptolemaei, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epitoma_in_Almagestum_Ptolemaei(last revision: 06.02.2022).","EncheiridionDer Widmungsbrief an Bessarion ist ein interessantes Zeugnis für das Wissenschaftsverständnis des 15.

The long letter of dedication to Louis III, Duke of Württemberg, which starts from an exuberant praise of astronomy bristling with biblical quotations (fols. *2r–[*7r]), goes on to lament the lack of good introductions to the discipline and the waste of time when beginners try to learn its fundamentals from depraved lecture transcripts. With his textbook, Mästlin attempts to raise the level of astronomical instruction in the schools of Württemberg (established by the Duke in ancient monasteries) where pupils are being prepared for university and at the duchy's university in Tübingen itself (fols. [*7r]–**2r).  The last part of the dedication is reserved for praise of the Duke (fols. **2r–[**3v]). The letter to the reader (fols. **4r–[**8v]) discusses how a good astronomical introduction should be written. Mästlin sharply criticizes the faults of some unnamed predecessors (lack of order; focus on irrelevancies; naked subdivisions without explanations; factual errors), but praisesSacroboscoand hismethodus(""order, orderly structure""), while blaming his partly outdated contents on his barbarian times. He has chosen to follow Sacrobosco's order, improving it in some parts and adding the better knowledge of his own age. He also has taken care not to be so concise as to become obscure, and has equipped his work with illustrations, which are most necessary in this field.  After two panegyric elegies on Mästlin and a list of printing errors, theAbstract of Astronomyitself starts.StructureA preliminary section (pp. 1–16) presents the geometrical foundations of astronomy along with the respective terminology and  gives an overview of the contents of the book (pp. 17–19), which inter alia explains the distinction between the two parts of astronomy,doctrina sphaericaandtheorica planetarum. The former is concerned with the phenomena in the sphere of the fixed stars and their reasons (phaenomena et rationes primi motus considerat et explicat), the latter devotes itself to the planets and everything that happens to them (apparentias, conversiones, anomalias etc. secundi motus scrutatur et numerat; for an etymological explanation of the names of the two parts, see Kepler'sEpitome astronomiae Copernicanae, GW 7, p. 31).The core text is divided into four books after the model of Sacrobosco'sSphaera, as announced. They deal with the subject and fundamental notions of astronomy (book 1, pp. 20–88), the representation of the celestial circles and planetary orbits on the armillary sphere (sphaera materialis, an instrument depicted on the title page;book 2, pp. 89–182),astronomia sphaerica(book 3, pp. 183–292), andastronomia theorica(book 4, pp. 293–486). There are several appendixes dealing with various subjects from mathematical geography. The last, for instance, which concludes the whole work (pp. 487–495), teaches how to calculate distances on the earth's surface.StyleThe single books are further subdivided into several parts, the single parts into long series of questions like, for instance,Quomodo dividitur zodiacus?(""How is the zodiac divided?"", p. 107) and answers to them. In other words, the work is an astronomical catechism. Most questions ask for a definition or a subdivision of some entity or category, as in the case just mentioned. Sometimes the questions are replaced by commands:Recense aliquot conclusiones ascensionum rectarum(""Enumerate some consequences of the [doctrine of the] right ascensions"", p. 190). Longer answers may be partitioned into short sections by Roman or Arabic numerals. In some cases, answers are supplemented by explanatory notes. The various hierarchical levels of the account are clearly differentiated typographically by means of font size, centered type setting, indentation, and italic and Roman type. The language is syntactically simple. Technical terms are introduced before their first use byQuid estquestions. A considerable number of accurate and technically accomplished diagrams give the reader a better grasp of the phenomena described.It must be emphasized that Mästlin's textbook is a geocentric, classical textbook of astronomy in the medieval european tradition, although polished in many ways. By 1570, he had bought an exemplar ofCopernicus'sDe revolutionibus orbium coelestiumwhich conversed him to Copernicanism. For a the beginners, however, he thought that the traditional view might be easier to understand und thus chose this world model for his textbook (Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 9, 168.SuccessMästlin's book was deservedly successful. Whether it was instrumental in furthering Mästlin's appointment to the University of Tübingen is unclear, but it certainly did no harm in this respect. It was republished in revised form (ab auctore diligenter recognita) in 1588, and subsequently reprinted twice in 1597 and 1598. A newly revised edition appeared in 1610 and again in 1624 (for a full list of the editions, seeComplete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 9, 169). The work, which presents itself as a kind of updated version of Sacrobosco'sSphaera, in turn inspired Mästlin's disciple Johannes Kepler to produce his own textbook, theEpitome astronomiae Copernicanae, which refers to the older work in its title and also imitates its catechetical structure but definitely takes the new Copernican world system into account.",Rex 2002,"Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Mathesis iuvenilis‎(← links)Mästlin, Michael‎(← links)Ordo et ordinis ratio in legendis Hippocratis et Galeni libris‎(← links)Institutio astronomica‎(← links)","Mästlin, Michael:Epitome astronomiae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epitome_astronomiae(last revision: 12.10.2022).",,MK,Yes,"MK, FB",

In fact, it is Kepler's most comprehensive work – nearly 1000 densely printed octavo pages – and summarizes his own astrological and cosmological views (which of course build on Copernicus' work to some degree). The title, which is partly borrowed from a similar work by Kepler's teacher Michael Mästlin, theEpitome astronomiae, may have been chosen to attract readers by a famous name and by the promise of a simplified account of an intricate field and at the same time to emphasize the heliocentric cosmology of the book. The latter distinguishes it heavily from its predecessors.Having finished and published his most important astronomical work, theAstronomia nova, in 1609, Kepler wanted to disseminate his new insights in textbook format. These plans kept him busy over the next dozen years. To get the work into print proved very difficult in terms of finances and organization (Pantin 2006, 222–226). In 1618, 1620, and 1621, theEpitome, dedicated to the Estates of Upper Austria, finally appeared in three parts.The first of these, which comprises books 1–3, gives an overview of spherical astronomy. But apart from the classical matters, Kepler also discusses the arguments for the motion of the earth and relativity of motion. These ideas were seized byGalileiin hisDialogo.The second part, book 4, is probably the most remarkable one. It discusses celestial mechanics in general, which Kepler understands to be the fundament of theoretical astronomy. As the book's title indicates, Kepler thinks that it can be used separately to supplement Aristotle'sDe caelo, still a popular textbook of cosmology at the time. Here, many aspects of Kepler's cosmology can be found, as nested polyhedrons (cf.Mysterium cosmographicum), magnetic forces, elliptical orbits, law of area, and also an explanation of his harmonic (or third) law, first presented in hisHarmonice mundi. But also metaphysical identifications of the sun and center with the Father, the outermost sphere with the Son and the space inbetween with the Holy Spirit, and thus of the universe with the Trinity, underline the theological basis of Kepler's cosmology. He points out the physical causes of the planetary motions and first states that the moon's motion is created by an intertwining of the magnetic forces of the Earth and the Sun. This insight enabled him to introduce the annual component to the lunar theory.Part three (books 5–7) is dedicated to theorical astronomy, discussing practical geometrical problems emerging from his astronomy, planetary motion in itself and as seen from the earth; longue durée phenomena such as the precession of the equinoxes are discussed as well. This last part would also serve as theoretical explanation for theTabulae Rudolphinae.TheEpitome'slong and difficult gestation (Caspar 1953, 542–548) enabled Kepler to go beyond theAstronomia novain many respects and to incorporate new insights and methods which he had found himself or learned from others after 1609. Among the most important of these are Galilei's telescopic observations, Napier's logarithms (cf.Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio) alleviating time consuming multiplication tasks in spherical trigonometry and Kepler's own third law of planetary motion. As in other works, such 'hard' science is freely combined with philosophical and theological speculation.Although theEpitomecontains comparatively little mathematics, it is a very advanced and in part idiosyncratic textbook otherwise. By contrast, Kepler already highlights on the title page that it is written in an old and well-tried textbook format, that of a catechism (usitata forma quaestionum et responsionum conscripta, ""composed in the usual form of questions and answers""). In doing so, Kepler once again follows the model of Mästlin'sEpitome astronomiae. However, his book is much less dry than an ordinary catechism. The answers to the single questions are not confined to short statements to be learned by heart, as for example in religious catechisms. They rather run to considerable length and are written in Kepler's customary lively style. Even the questions themselves are more than simple requests for information. They may also express doubts or object to Kepler's explanations and thereby drive the discussion forward. In some parts, the work comes close to a dialogue between two anonymous interlocutors.Kepler's textbook is embedded in a number of paratexts. The letter of dedication sketches the work's vexed genesis, gives a catalogue of earlier astronomical textbooks, explains the didactic advantages of the chosen format, provides a spirited plea for novelty in science (tota … philosophia novatio est in vetusta ignorantia, ""all … philosophy is innovation in the midst of traditional ignorance"") and calls theEpitomea ""sacred hymn to God, the Creator"" (hymnum sacrum Deo Conditori). It is followed by two short panegyrical epigrams (seeComparatio Ptolemaei et Kepleri), a table of right ascensions and declinations and an interesting index of technical terms, which is complemented by a general index at the end. The main text itself is richly illustrated with diagrams and also contains a number of tables and charts (see, e.g., the Ramist table summarising the affections of the planets inserted at the end but belonging to p. 821).Although it has been claimed that ""from 1630 to 1650 theEpitomewas the most widely read treatise on theoretical astronomy in Europe"" (Dictionary of Scientific Biography 1970–1986, vol. 7, 302), the work seems to have had only some limited success but did not become particularly popular (Gingerich 1990, 192). There are only two editions: The original printrun apparently was 650 copies. In 1635, an unchanged second edition appeared in Frankfurt (Caspar 1953, 547–548).","Caspar 1953, esp. 541–574Pantin 2006Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 7, 302–304","Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)Comparatio Ptolemaei et Kepleri‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae‎(← links)Institutio astronomica‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes:Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epitome_astronomiae_Copernicanae(last revision: 21.02.2022).","May count as textbook (although probably never used in actual teaching) becaus of K.s letter of dedication, at whose beginnings he says that he now wants to minoribus subselliis accomodare his inventions, makes a connection to the teaching expected from him in Linz (nobilissimam vestram iuventutem ore-tenus in hac scientia instituendi).

Pieter (Petrus) van Musschenbroek is one of the central 18th-century figures in this endeavour. In 1717, a few years after his graduation in Leiden, Musschenbroek travelled to England, where he met Newton and Desaguliers, who popularized Newton's ideas both in the learned world and among a wider audience. Nine years later, when he was professor of mathematics and philosophy in Utrecht, Musschenbroek published the first of a series of Latin physics textbooks,Epitome elementorum physico-mathematicorum. In 1734, Musschenbroek’sElementa physicaeappeared in print, followed byInstitutiones physicaein 1748 and the posthumousIntroductio ad philosophiam naturalemin 1762. From one textbook to the next, Musschenbroek kept recycling material, so that ""one might consider him as reworking, updating and extending one and the same textbook, which was published throughout his lifetime under different names"" (Ducheyne 2015, 281).This database entry deals with the first of these printed books, theEpitome elementorum physico-mathematicorum(Epitome of the Physico-Mathematical Basics). It is marketed as a university textbook on the title page, which states that it was written for academic use (conscripta in usus academicos). Indeed, it comes as a handy octavo book of some 370 pages, with a simple layout and no illustrations. TheEpitomeis divided into two parts of similar length, covering i.a. gravity, mechanics, optics, acustics and meteorology. Each paragraph of the textbook is numbered, amounting to 1241 paragraphs in total. This reference system is probably intended to facilitate working with the book in the classroom.In the preface, Musschenbroek programmatically follows Newton in rejecting hypotheses, which are surrounded by many alluring words and adorned with clever reasoning (multis verborum lenociniis stipatae rationibusque acutis ornatae, fol. *4v), and embracing mathematics and experiments as the true methods of physics instead. (Despite this general allegiance, there were differences between Newton and Musschenbroek both in specific problems of physics and in methodological thinking, asDucheyne 2015pointed out). TheEpitome elementorum physico-mathematicorumwill provide a student with the knowledge he needs to have before he advances to Newton's work. Musschenbroek advertises experimental demonstrations also in teaching: they help the students remember what they learned and cancel out any weariness beginners in mathematics might experience.Indeed, the preface also provides an interesting glimpse into the classroom, as Musschenbroek outlines the audience of the textbook and its use in teaching: It is written fortirones, i.e. beginners, whom Musschenbrock teaches every year (in annuis exercitationibus domesticis, fol. *3r), and deals only with the very basics of physics, because the students cannot yet grasp the more complicated aspects of physics and would rather be discouraged by them. Having a printed text will save time in the lessons, which the students would otherwise need to write everything down. However, the textbook is only one side of the coin: it contains onlytheoremata, no experimental demonstrations, because that would have made the the textbook too long. But this does not mean that demonstrations should not be carried out in class, on the contrary: Musschenbroek himself performs the experiments live, while the listeners can take notes. Similarly, the textbook contains no illustrations, but they should be drawn during demonstrations and teaching. Musschenbroek concedes that his textbook cannot stand on its own: as in all areas of mathematics, a beginner will run into difficulties if he tries to learn everything solely by reading, without the explanations and demonstrations provided in class.Musschenbroek's Latin physics textbooks seem to have been in high demand at universities, as different versions were being issued by the printing press for fourty years. However, they also found a readership outside academic teaching, as the many contemporary translations – i.a. into Dutch, German, English and French – attest.",Ducheyne 2015;Jorink; Zuidervaart 2019,"Musschenbroek, Petrus van‎(← links)","Musschenbroek, Petrus van:Epitome elementorum physico-mathematicorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Epitome_elementorum_physico-mathematicorum(last revision: 31.01.2022).",,,Yes,IT,

Conceptually, Laguna's endeavour is to some degree comparable to Sir Thomas Burnet's much laterHippocrates contractus. In contrast to that book, however, theEpitome Galeni operumis not a collection of excerpts but presents shortened, but nonetheless coherent Latin versions of each and every Galenic treatise. Laguna's work must be among the longest compendia ever published, as it comprises over 640 two-column folio pages in small and dense print, not counting the paratexts. The latter are numerous: at the beginning, one finds (a) a letter to the reader by the printer Michael Isengrin, partly culled from (c) and printed on the title page, (b) a poem of praise in eleven hendecasyllables by a certain Pyrrhus, (c) a dedication to Francisco Mendoza de Bobadilla, bishop of Cória in Estremadura, and (d) a table of contents. Galen's works are followed by (e) a short treatise on medical weights and measures, (f) a life of Galen, and (g) notes on the translations used, all three by Laguna himself and preceded by their own dedications (as well as a note to the reader in the last case),  (h) an index comprising over 10,000 entries, and (i) a very short list of errata.In the main part, Galen's works are arranged in four sections dedicated to introductory and anatomical writings, dietetics and diagnostics, nosology and therapy, and pharmacology respectively. Each work is generously equipped with thematic marginalia but at the same time severely pruned. A one-book monograph likeDe nervorum dissectione(vol. 2, pp. 831–56 Kühn), for instance, is condensed to two columns (cols. 149–151) or one page. The total of Kühn's about 16,000 pages is reduced to one twenty-fifth. Considering that Kühn has to use half of his space for the Greek original and that one of his quarto pages may contain only one fourth of Laguna's folios, Laguna presumably still cuts out two thirds of the original text on average. Otherwise, the latter is left untouched, and nothing is added in terms of paraphrases or transitions. The same philological diligence also shows in the attribution of the different translations used to their respective authors in (d) and in the criticism they are subjected to in (g): passages mistranslated according to Laguna, marked with an asterisk in the text, are confronted with the Greek original, of which a correct translation is given, followed by a short comment on occasion.The book's raison d'être is clearly stated in (a) and (b): Galen is of course essential reading for every physician, but he is reader-unfriendly and deterrent, as Isengrim puts it,ob prolixitatem … immensam, quae in tanta vitae brevitate est incommoda(""because of his enormous … verbosity, which is inconvenient given that life is so short""). By excising his digressions and otiose polemics and reducing Galen's writing to anexiguum quoddam corpus(""small body""), Laguna has rendered the medical communityhaud mediocrem utilitatem(""a highly useful service""). Readers agreed. TheEpitome(parts of which seem to have been printed as early as 1548) was republished at least four times in 1553, 1571, 1604, and 1643.

One motive for gaining geographical knowledge was the wish to understand biblical geography. The presentShort Description of the Three Parts of the Worldis among the works which tried to fulfill this desire. The full title of the work, which Vadianus composed some fifteen years after hiscommentary on Pomponius Mela, drawing on the geographical expertise acquired back then, indicates that it was meant as a guide to the places mentioned inActs, the Gospels, and the letters of the New Testament (quorum in Actis Lucas, passim autem evangelistae et apostoli meminere.)Despite its considerable bulk of nearly 600 octavo pages, the book is called anepitomein its title and promoted as a shortcut to geographical understanding in the first introductory paratext, a laudatory poem in hendecasyllables by a certain Johannes Kessler. The  poem is followed by a letter of dedication to no less a personality than Heinrich Bullinger, the antistes of the Zurich church  (pp. 3–18). After a lengthy defense and glorification of the liberal arts, the investigation of nature, and in particular geography, Vadianus explains the work's gestation and purpose (pp. 16–18): it originated from lectures given by him in connection with a reading ofActstogether with his fellow clerics as St Gall; being now published as a companion piece toBullinger's commentary onActs(1533), it is meant to provide the geographical context necessary for an understanding of this part of the New Testament and to exhort readers to acquire historical and geographical knowledge for themselves, in particular through the use of maps.The work itself starts from an introduction to basic cosmographical and geographical notions (pp. 19–37). After that, Europe (pp. 37–131), Africa (pp. 131–169), Asia (pp. 169–507), and finally the islands of the Mediterranean and the Ocean (pp. 507–564) are described. The disproportionate space allotted to Asia is due to the inclusion of Egypt, but above all to detailed discussions of biblical places and regions (even the Paradise is discussed at length, pp. 376–406). At the end, one finds three pages of errata as well as an index of all cities, peoples, rivers, places and other subjects mentioned in the New Testament. Within the single continents, the account proceeds region by region. Each territory is characterized in terms of geographical position and adjacent regions, relief, rivers and lakes, fertility, and population. This geographical information is supplemented by numerous historical and archivarian excursuses. A substantial portion of the Galilaea section (pp. 280–283), for instance, is devoted to a discussion of the termstetrarchaandtetrarchiataking its cue fromActs12, where the thetetrarchaHerodes is calledrex. Besides the Bible, church fathers, but also pagan authors are generously cited. Vadianus writes a classical Latin which is unassuming in terms of vocabulary, grammar, and style and easy to follow in spite of its sometimes lengthy periods. His vivid descriptions make for an agreeable read, as in the following characterization of an oasis city in present-day Tunisia (p. 153):Mirandum autem in tanta locorum desertorum vastitate quaedam esse insularum instar (Strabo abases vocat) quae cetera fertilitate vincant. Est iuxta alteram Syrtim Tacapa civitas in mediis arenis sita, solo super omne miraculum riguo ac fertili, biferam enim vitem bis in anno vindemiat.""However, it is astonishing that in this enormous waste spaces there are some island-like places, called ""abases"" by Strabo, which surpass the rest in fertility. Close to the Lesser Syrtis, there is the town of Tacapa in the middle of the sands: its soil is so moist and fertile that it tops any miracle, for it has grapevines which bear fruit twice and holds a vintage twice a year.The first edition simultaneously came out in two different versions, a plain octavo volume, on which the present description is based, and a deluxe edition in quarto. In the latter, the index of biblical geography has been moved before the main text and is accompanied by two bonus features, a complete index of everything contained in the book, compiled by the printer, and a world map. The present octavo copy has been diligently worked through: it features notations in red ink from beginning to end.

Nonetheless, the details of the practice were continuously debated, and a few doctors wanted to severly restrict it or to abolish it altogether. The Italian physician Lucantonio Porzio formed part of this minority. HisErasistratus or On Bloodletting, a booklet of nearly 400 duodecimo pages, constitutes a remarkable contribution to the venesection discussion.The book opens with a dedication to Christina of Sweden (in exile at Rome since 1655) which inter alia justifies the author's decision to present his work in dialogic form (fol. a3r):Sed ut omnem effugerem invidiam, eam dicendi rationem sum amplexatus, quae minime arrogans est, dialogi scilicet…(""But in order to avoid all resentment, I embraced the least arrogant way of speaking, the dialogic one…""). The unpaginated preface to the reader, written by Porzio's colleague Gregorio Rossi, repeats this point (fourth page), which the author took quite serious, as will become evident. The preface also pointedly characterizes the four interlocutors (sixth page). Subsequently, a table of contents summarizes the course of the conversation. The thematic index at the end of the volume (pp. 357–68) implies that Porzio wanted to provide a comprehensive treatment of the subject which could not only be read through, but also serve as a work of reference.The body of the book is partitioned into four dialogues (pp. 1–72; 73–132; 133–72; 173–292), which nevertheless reproduce one continuous discussion, plus an oration (pp. 293–356). The dialogues feature four speakers which can be subdivided into groups of two in three different ways: There are two famous ancient doctors, namely Erasistratus (3rd century BC) and Galen (2nd/3rd century AD), and two modern ones, Jan Baptist van Helmont (†1644) and Thomas Willis (†1675). Two speakers initially endorse phlebotomy (Galen, Willis), the others (Erasistratus, van Helmont) oppose it from the outset. Two peaceable characters (Erasistratus, Willis) contrast with two pugnacious ones (Galen, van Helmont). In the course of the first three dialogues, which are concerned with the theoretic aspects of the question, Erasistratus and van Helmont manage to win over their colleagues to their own position. This transpires as early as the beginning of the third dialogue (p. 133), while at the beginning of the fourth (p. 173), all participants already agree that venesection should be appliednumquam vel nimis raro(""never or extremely rarely"", p. 173). The last dialogue puts the consensus reached so far to the test by means of case histories taken from the Hippocratic Corpus, Galen, and Willis. No conclusive proof of the usefulness of venesection results from any of the respective cases (pp. 291–92). The four dialogues are in a sense continued and concluded by anApologia Galeniaddressed to Erasistratus. In this oration, Galen excuses his errors with the weakness of the human mind in general and the intellectual climate of imperial Rome in particular, but also claims to mostly have discouraged doctors and patients from bloodletting anyway.Also apart from Porzio's nonconformist position within the phlebotomy debate, theErasistratusis a highly original book. Two aspects in particular stand out as exceptional: Firstly, Porzio takes up the Lucianic tradition of dialogues of dead people, adopting the exposure of the follies committed by some speakers during their lifetime, but cutting back the satyrical element and applying the form to a serious subject. In this way, he is able to stage a dialogue between ancient and modern doctors which could not take place in a more realistic setting. Secondly, by handing the discussion over to several great physicians from different times and places, Porzio steps out of the line of fire himself. He seemingly adopts a neutral stance and lets the question be decided by theres publica medicorum. In fact, Erasistratus probably is the speaker whose ideas come closest to Porzio's own, as suggested by the title, but this is never made explicit. Instead, the author applies a peculiar technique to enhance the impression that the work is just a comparison between arguments culled from the tradition even further: The participants regularly speak in quotations from their own works, which is made obvious by the use of italics.Despite its merits, which in addition to the aforementioned also comprise fluent Latin, lively dialogue and unobtrusive humour, theErasistratuswas no great success.

In this poem, the importance of medicine for humankind is highlighted and Fuchs’s new book praised. After this follows a dedicatory letter to George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, whom Fuchs served as a personal physician. In it, Fuchs not only praises his patron, but also sets out his reasons for writing this work, i.e. mainly to show misconceptions of contemporary medicine and correct them in order to help students of medicine.

The work published posthumously is dedicated to Cardinal Francisco Barberini. Relying on a long-standing tradition of natural philosophical debates on the origin of tides, in the first, general part De Dominis attributes the phenomenon to the effects and positions of the Sun and the Moon. However, unlike his medieval and Renaissance predecessors, he does not connect the phenomenon with astrological elements, staying mostly within the scientific discourse. Since he draws on astronomy and geometry, this part also contains some drawings with the use of which De Dominis seeks to provide the mathematical foundation of his theory. De Dominis expandsFederico Chrisogono's argument (seeDe fluxu et refluxu maris) by claiming that the tides are due to the interaction of the sun and the moon, which exert an effect on the water similar to magnetism, and that the action of the two luminaries is at its maximum not only where they are at the zenith but also at the antipodal point.The second part (starting from p. 46) deals with six quaesita. These include, for instance, a problem why the tides are different in different seas, or why they occur in different time periods. By highlighting various additional characteristics of tides, such as the geographical variation in height and the possibility of horizontal ‘tidal currents’, De Dominis claims that the natural phenomena are not explicable with regard to astronomical data alone but also depend on the size and depth of the seas concerned.
Despite the insightful character and significance of theEuripus seu de fluxu et refluxu maris sententia, the treatise along with other works by De Dominis was subjected to criticism, which had nothing to do with his contribution to scientific knowledge of the time, but exclusively with an accusation of heresy. This attitude towards De Dominis' contribution to the subject in question was reflected, for instance, inBoskovic'sDissertatio de maris aestuand other related writings.","Bonelli, Russo 1996Croation academy of sciences and arts 2005","De radiis visus et lucis in vitris perspectivis et iride tractatus‎(← links)Dominis, Marco Antonio de‎(← links)Dissertatio de maris aestu‎(← links)De fluxu et refluxu maris‎(← links)","Dominis, Marco Antonio de:Euripus seu de fluxu et refluxu maris sententia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Euripus_seu_de_fluxu_et_refluxu_maris_sententia(last revision: 19.11.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

Aelianus avoided any order in this work on purpose and freely mixed chapters on various animals according to the principle of ποικιλία (poikilía, ""variety""). Even before theeditio princepsof the Greek text was published byConrad Gessnerin 1556, the French Pierre Gilles or Petrus Gyllius issued a Latin translation of Aelian’sDe natura animaliumbased on a manuscript in 1533.The translation is dedicated to King Francis I. In the long letter to the king (fol. A2r–B4v), we find the typical topos of monarchs who fostered the study of nature or were even naturalists themselves. The comparison to the relationship of Aristotle with Alexander the Great is also contained and surely more flattering to Gilles than to the French king.
This dedicatory letter is followed by an introductory chapter (fol. B4v–C5v) titledDe bestiarum praestantia caput generale instar praefationis huic operi praepositum. In this chapter, Gilles highlights the mental and moral pre-eminence of animals over humans. This is also an important topic in Aelian’s work, but Gilles goes beyond its source text and states that animals are endowed with reason, which Aelian denied.
Aelian’s proem and the epilogue have not been translated by Gilles and the rest of the work has been brought into an order insofar as Gilles has accumulated all chapters on a specific animal in one place. Moreover, Gilles reduced Aelians 17 books to 16 and divided them into three groups: Books 1–9 deal with land animals, books 10–13 with aquatic animals and books 14–16 with animals that can fly. There is, however, no evident overall order within these larger groups. The chapters to the single animals can be found via the three indexes (referring to the three groups of animals) at the end of the work.
Another important change with regard to his source, is the inclusion of further information. These additional chapters are marked asGyllii accessioin the text (in the second edition of 1535 in the margins). Most of theseaccessionescontain additional texts on the respective animal taken from other ancient sources (both Greek and Latin, but always in Latin translation) younger than Aristotle. In some cases, contemporary knowledge is included. A famous example is the description of an opossum (1533, 131) that Gilles conceptualized as some kind of fox and calledsimivulpa.
The translation of Aelian’s Greek text is mostly accurate and written in good Latin style. However, Gilles left out some passages that he thought could be too offensive (this is already indicated in the introduction [fol. C5v]).
The volume also contains a book on fish and other aquatic animals by Gilles himself, theLiber unus de Gallicis et Latinis nominibus piscium. It is is not a glossary, but rather a collection of 120 concise chapters that are deals with the identification of fish species known in France. Sometimes the names are also explained.
A second edition appeared soon after the first in 1535. Gessner’sopera omniaedition of Aelian (Zurich 1556) contained Gilles translation facing the Greek text, but the original order or rather the intentional disorder of Aelians work was restored. The same can be said about the re-edition of Gilles’s translation from 1562, in which the editor Jean Toullier also restored Aelian’s original pattern.","Bäumer 1991, 20-23.","Aelianus, Claudius‎(← links)","Gilles, Pierre; Aelianus, Claudius:Ex Aeliani Historia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ex_Aeliani_Historia(last revision: 25.12.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

In theepistola nuncupatoriaaddressed at Ercole II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara and his wife Renée of France, Brasavola presents the story of Socrates who who asked students to look at themselves in the mirror and to devote themselves to self-knowledge and moral improvement. He then goes on to praise the duke, his wife, and their family as morally refined persons over several pages.The main work is a dialog between Brasavola’salter ego, aherbarius, and a certainsenex(“old man”), an elderly apothecary. At the beginning of the dialog, theherbariusand thesenexare said to have just returned from a field trip to the Alps to collect herbs and Brasavola’salter egoapproves of it. The traditional way of pharmacopoeia was based on authoritative texts inherited from antiquity, Dioscorides’ work onmateria medicain particular. However, with time physicians and apothecaries relied less on their own experience with medical simples, in this case mostly plants, but on the study of texts. Thus, a plant described in Dioscorides was often identified with different species by local practitioners. Brasavola advocates field trips and personal studies of plants. Moreover, Brasavola is one of the first to explicitly acknowledging that there are far more plant species to discover than the ancient authorities knew, or as he lets hisalter egosay (p. 103):certum vero est centesimam partem herbarum in universo orbe constantium non esse descriptam a Dioscoride, nec plantarum a Theophrasto aut Plinio, sed in dies addiscimus et crescit ars medica.– “But surly not a hundredth part of the herbs in the whole world was described by Dioscorides, not a hundredth part of the plants by Theophrastus and Pliny, but every day we learn more and the art of medicine grows.” (translationMorton 1981, 118).
Brasovola andsenexdiscuss a number of plants but as the single species and other items are not easily found in the continuous dialogue of more than 600 pages, an alphabetical index of Greek Latin, Arabic, and vernacular lemmata (only Greek names are in Greek letters) has been inserted between theepistola nuncupatoriaand the main work. The text is written in elegant Latin style although it necessarily contains a number of technical terms of plant species.","Morton 1981, 118.","Brasavola, Antonio Musa‎(← links)","Brasavola, Antonio Musa:Examen omnium simplicium medicamentorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Examen_omnium_simplicium_medicamentorum(last revision: 21.06.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

This criticism is a late contribution to a larger debate, the so-calledQuaestio de certitudine mathematicaruminitiated byAlessandro Piccolominiin hisCommentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarumsome 100 years before.Wallis had claimed that mathematical proofs reach different stages of being scientific, depending on whether they aredemonstrationes propter quid(proceeding from causes to effects), the highest form,demonstrationes quia(from effects to causes), or, adding a new category to the debate, areductio ad absurdum, an even weaker form of aquiademonstration and thus least scientific. Hobbes rejects this distinction in his six dialogues.After the titlepage, a short dedication letter to a Francois du Verdus (Verdusius Aquitanus), a table of content and anerratapage, the dialogues start. The speakers are called A and B and discuss the new book of Wallis. The titles of the dialogues are:De mathematicae origine, et principiis scientiae et de natura demonstrationisDe principiis traditis ab EuclideDe demonstratione operationum arithmeticarum et ragulae aureaeDe rationibusDe angulo contactus, de sectionibus coni, etarithmetica infinitorum(these are titles of three of Wallis's works)Dimensio circuli tribus methodis demonstrata quarum prior habet propositiones 25. Secunda 11. Tertia 3. Item cycloidis verae descriptio et proprietates aliquot.Therein, Hobbes criticises Wallis's definition of a proof for being circular. But more importantly he rejects Wallis's proclaimed different degrees of mathematical perfection according to the stages of the proof and him acceptingquiademonstrations. For Hobbes, scientific proofs only proceed from causes to effects, as knowledge must always be based on reasons. But then he argues that all proofs in mathematics, even proofs by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum) are based on causes and therefore all mathematical proofs arepropter quidproofs. This distinguishes mathematics from physics which infers from effects to causes. But this also ignores the previous subtle investigations of Aristotelian logic and also the fact that mathematics itself has become the new language of science.","Mancosu 1992, esp. 255-258","Hobbes, Thomas‎(← links)Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum‎(← links)Mathesis universalis‎(← links)","Hobbes, Thomas:Examinatio et emendatio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Examinatio_et_emendatio(last revision: 22.07.2021).",Quastio de certitudine mathematicarum!The six dialogs are:,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,

A dedicatory letter and a preface to the reader close the paratext section.The first exercise (exercitatio prima) presents Cavalieri's first method of indivisibles as it can be found in chapters 1-7 in hisGeometria. Indeed serving as a streamlined and improved version of these chapters, references to the previous work abound. Even many figures are identical (see pages 13, 14, 20, and many more), partly new ones can be found as well (e.g. on page 15) whose improved quality is immediatly visible.The second exercise is on Cavalieri's second method of indivisibles as discussed in book 7 of theGeometria, Proposition I stating the famous ""Cavalieri principle"". The structure of these first two exercises is very similar to their model: Numbered paragraphs and numbered definitions, postulates and propositions are listed one after another without any other subsections.Exercise three, probably the centerpiece of the work, is a defense against Guldin's accusations and objections he had raised in hisCentrobaryca. Unlike the previous exercices, it is subdivided in 15capites, the first 13 defensive, chapters 14 and 15 attacking Guldin's own shortcomings. Each of the prior chapters deals with two to six sections of theCentrobarycawhich is explicitly noted in the chapter headings. The main issues brought up by Guldin are accusations of plagiarism and of atomism - his notion of ""all the lines"" can never constitute a geometrical figure (seeGeometria). Attacking the second method, Guldin denies that theorems on not previously constructed figures can be proven. Cavalieri's principle of Book 7 is such an assertion. Cavalieri rejects all these accusations and discusses even the real problem in his proof which Guldin failed to address: His method is not guaranteed to terminate. The offensive part touches upon a matter which is part of a wider discussion on the certainty or epistemology of mathematics: The priority of direct or ostensive proofs which not only showthatbutwhysomething is true (this is a prolongation of theQueastio de certitudine mathematicarumdebate intitiated byAlessandro Piccolominiin hisCommentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum). Cavalieri notices that Guldin's central method (later called ""Guldin's rule"") is based on a proof by contradiction. Probably most vexingly for Guldin, Cavalieri provides an ostensive proof using his method of indivisibles (Mancosu 1996, 60-63).Exercise four covers integration of power functions; in exercise five centers of gravity and in exercise six several applications from optics (mirrors and lenses), hydraulics and other special mathematical problems are treated. In these exercises relations and references to various works likeKepler'sNova stereometria doliorum, toTorricelli'sDe dimensione parabolae, toGalileo'sDialogo,Pappus'sMathematical collection, and many others are explicitly mentioned.Cavalieri shows himself as a self-confident but very cauious and reflected author. He is informed about recent developments in mathematics and knows he has invented a powerful but not a 100 percent justified tool. During the seventeenth century, his method of indivisibles remained an important tool for many geometers likeTorricelliorWallis. It became only outdated around 1700, whenNewtonandLeibnizwho both favoured infinitesimals, revolutionized infinitesimal calculus.","Alexander 2014, 80-118Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008vol. 3, 149-153Edwards 1979, 104-113Mancosu 1996, 38-63",Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum promota‎(← links),"Cavalieri, Bonaventura:Exercitationes geometricae sex, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Exercitationes_geometricae_sex(last revision: 02.05.2022).",,,Yes,FB,

TheExercitationesare essentially a collection of eight lectures of the author at the university of Aix, where he had been professor since 1616. The work displays a highly scepticist view, influenced by Sextus Empiricus, stating that there is no knowledge, and especially no Aristotelian knowledge. While book one of the proposed whole work, which corresponds to theExercitationes, contradicts the doctrines of the Aristotelians (not necessarily Aristotle's) in general, other planned volumes as described in the preface of volume one included more explicit scientific content, e.g. book three, which would have dealt with physics according to the Aristotelians, the existence of a vacuum and other controversial questions; book four and five, which would have treated cosmology and astronomy.

It was presented underpraesesGottfried Cernitz, with Johann-Georg Küssing asrespondens.The dissertation consists, besides the title page, of 14 pages, which are divided into a short preface, tentheses, shortcorollariawith deepening questions on snow and a poem for therespondens.The preface begins with a quote from the Psalms (147,5–7 = 147,16–18Nova Vulgata) (dat nivem sicut lanam …); the beautiful mechanisms of the world and all the elements (e. g., hail, snow, wind) are a divine creation, and this creation is worthy of praise, contemplation, investigation, as all observations aggrandize the divine glory. On that account, examination and contemplation go hand in hand, and this also applies for exploring themeteororum natura.The main text consists of 10theses; they all begin with a brief lead text, and some theses are also divided into singular paragraphs. The four Aristotelian questions (on matter, form, agent and end) build the structural and formal background (cf., e.g., theDiaskepsis physike de nive); beginning with definitions and etymology, followed by questions about the matter (cf. §§ 5, 7) and the agent (§ 6), then followed by deliberations about the form (§§ 7, 8) and the “end” of snow (§ 9).Thecolophonresp.corollariacontain further (deepening) questions.

In elegiac couplets, the poet invites his addressee to contemplate the paper gift by Athena, who is described showing her face and hair in the starlight, like snow. Scilicet, nature, with a white thumb, points out particularities about snow: From where it falls, how it forms, how it turns into rain, if warm and cold contribute to its formation, what snowflakes are like, how it influences the soil etc. Finally, the dissertation, written by adoctusbacked by Athena, is deemed worthy of being published.",,"Cernitz, Gottfried‎(← links)Küssing, Johann-Georg‎(← links)","Cernitz, Gottfried; Küssing, Johann-Georg:Exercitium physicum de nive, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Exercitium_physicum_de_nive(last revision: 13.09.2021).","Table of contents:1: On “nix” and “glacies” as part of the “meteora aquea”, on their generation. 2 paragraphs. The author closely follows Aristotle in his explanations how snow, rime, ice form.2: On the etymology of “nix”. 1 paragraph. Because one needs good sails in order to reach the safe haven (“portum tranquillitatis et scientiae”) in a storm without agitation, the author of this dissertation wants to set the etymological sail properly. This metaphor is followed by etymological demonstrations which closely rely on authorities as Scaliger, Lucretius, Virgil.3: Definition/delimitation, concerning the phenomenon in other languages and terms. 1 paragraph, naming “imber nivalis”, “spuma caelestium aquarum”, “flocci nivei”, “tacitarum vellus aquarum” (Mart. 4,3), „pruina et canities brumalis“, the quotation on „lana“ in the Psalms (147), the Hebrew and the vernacular German term for snow; interestingly, the author establishes a relation between “schneien” and “schneiden”, namely “cum ratione formae, tum effecti”.4: Definition/delimitation, concerning the use of the term “nix” in a broader sense. 1 paragraph, to demarcate the real phenomenon from “improper” (i.e., mainly metaphorical) use, as in “canis” (gray-haired or hoary, cf. Horace), “tegimentum” (covering), “aphrogala” (milk froth).5: Description and examination of the “real” snow. 3 paragraphs (“ipsa quid res”, “generis locum”, “genus nivis”). The author relies on Aristotle (Meteor., De caelo) and his idea that 
snow belongs to the aquatic meteora and mainly consists of vapor which is uplifted to the “mediae aeris regio” and begins to condense within clouds; the text also cites Wolfgang Meurer (Quaestiones meteorologicae, 1587), Francesco Piccolomini (Pars quarta librorum ad scientiam … in qua meteorologica explicantur, 1600), the commentaries on Aristotle by the Conimbricenses (1592), Johann Sperling (Institutiones Physicae”. 1639), finally refers briefly to Empedocles when naming the four causes.6: On the agents or efficient causes (“causa efficiens”). 4 paragraphs (god as the “prima causa principalis”; the influence of the stars as “secunda causa principalis”; heat and cold as secondary “causae instrumentales”). (cf. Reusser Agerius 1627) The text cites the bible, Cicero and Aristotle (§1), presumably Daniel Sennert (“physica hypomnemata”, 1636), again the Conimbricenses on Aristotle (1592) (§2), presumably Tobias Magirus (1586-1652), Franciscus Vallés (De sacra philosophia, 1587).7: On the constituent parts (“materia”) of snow. 3 paragraphs (the clouds as closer “materia”; vapor as remote “materia”; water as very remote “materia”). The chapter refers to a certain Magirus (cf. above) and Aristotle.8: On the form of snow. 5 paragraphs (on the human limitations of the endeavor, including a metaphorical passage on Tantalus and Herkules); “interna forma essentialis”; “externa forma”; “candor”, “figura”). The chapter refers to Johannes Scharff (1595-1660, presumably “Metaphysica exemplaris” 1623), F. Piccolomini (cf. above), Magirus (cf. above), Meurer (cf. above), Aristotle; with regard to the last paragraph on the form of snow(flakes), the author does not seem to know Kepler’s “Strena”.9: On the “causa finalis” or purpose of snow. 5 paragraphs (the testimony of the divine glory as main purpose; the contribution to the universal good as general purpose: fertility, irrigation, physical contributions (to the health) and economical contributions (especially transportation). The chapter refers to the bible, Meurer (cf. above), Pliny, Aristotle, Scaliger, Johann Baptist Scortia (“De natura et incremento Nili libri duo”, 1617), presumably Konrad Bachmann (1572-1646).
10: Addenda. 5 paragraphs (“locus”: in which aerial regions snow is generated [1-2]; “tempus”: which weather conditions are necessary; “divisio” into snow and snowfall [cf. Reusser Agerius 1627]; signa: how to foretell snowfall).

Before these experiments, it was the common conception since antiquity that insects develop spontaneously from rotten or even inorganic material (the so-called spontaneous generation) and that the first stadium in their development is not the egg (which was unknown for a long time) but the maggot (see e.g.Berrens 2018, 144–146). Redi challenged and ultimately confuted this view by conducting a series of experiments, which he reports in graphic detail in his book. He used jars with different substrates that were either closed or open so that flies could access them. Maggots appeared only in the open jars and Redi thus rightly concluded that life develops only from living things. He could also – with the help of the microscope – observe, describe and depict (esp. p. 157 in the Italian and p. 264 in the Latin edition) different stadia in the development of insects.Redi cites and quotes a great number of ancient and modern authorities, including Arabic scholars like Avicenna. He usually does not give a translation of Latin, Greek and Arabic sources. Dante is treated differently because hisDivina Comediais quoted very often but he is not named directly but he is referred to through expressions like ""our divine poet"". 
Redi discusses in great detail the so-called bougonia, i.e. the belief that bees could develop from the carcasses of cattle, and similar zoogonies (see e.g.Berrens 2018, 187–217 for a discussion of ancient accounts of this theory). 
Francesco Redi's work is dedicated to his friend Carlo Dati whom he addresses from time to time in his treatise giving the impression that it is a long letter. It was published in Italian in Florence in 1668.
Andreas Frisius translated this important work into Latin and published it in Amsterdam in 1671. In his dedicatory letter to his friend Peter Coenissen that precedes the translation of Redi's text, Frisius states:libello huic, qui insectorum curiosissimam generationem et metamorphosin oculis spectantium pariter et auribus legentium obicit, quem Franciscus Redi, patritius Aretinus cum civibus suis Italice loqui fecerat, ego, ut omnibus secreta sua panderet, Latine loqui curavi, nominis tui inscriptionem praefixi.I have the inscription of your name put on the cover of this book, that presents the very curious generation and metamorphosis to the eyes of the viewers as well as to the ears of the readers, and that Francesco Redi, a nobleman from Arezzo had made speaking Italian with his fellow citizens, but I had had it speak Latin, so that it can disclose its secrets to all.Frisius aims, therefore, at making Redi's treatise better accessible to theres publica litterariaby translating it into Latin. 
Frisius characterizes his translation in the following letter to the reader. It is rather free and aims to reflect the thoughts of the author. He states that he should be thought of as a translator of another one's text rather as an orator if some passages sound inelegant and are not written in good Latin. This statement is probably an inversion of Cicero’s claim to translate not like a translator but like an orator (De optimo genere oratorum14).
Apart from translating Redi's own text, Frisius also translates all quotations contained in it into Latin.",Berrens 2018,"Redi, Francesco‎(← links)Frisius, Andreas‎(← links)","Redi, Francesco; Frisius, Andreas:Experimenta circa generationem insectorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Experimenta_circa_generationem_insectorum(last revision: 27.06.2021).","An experimental report, often interrupted by theoretical reflections and discussions of the opinions of earlier writers.Redi also reports experiments with scorpions (around p. 130); then on spiders; then on worms in fruit; caterpillars; fleas

Introduced by a dedication to Frederick III of Denmark in the form of a solemnellogium, an imitation of an inscription on paper, the text falls into two parts. Starting from a few remarks on the wonderful nature of the birefractive crystal, that is, calcite, the first part (pp. 1–41) describes 17experimenta. The second part (pp. 41–60), set apart by the subtitleObservationes ad demonstrationem praecedentium(""Observations to prove the preceding remarks""), first expounds a series of explanatory hypotheses regarding the remarkable behaviour of the stone (pp. 41–48) and proceeds to present a series ofpropositionesintended to show how well these explanations accord with the results of particular experiments (pp. 48–59). The work ends with a short justification of Bartholin's silence about the natural historical aspects of calcite, about which he does not dispose of enough information (p. 60).Bartholin'sexperimentaare accompanied by neat diagrams, most of which show a single calcit cristal and various beam paths in it, important points being labelled with capitals. These diagrams are precisely referenced in the text and are indispensable to its understanding. Theexperimentathemselves are of different kinds, ranging from simple observations (e.g. exp. I: the shape of the crystal; VI: double refraction) to let's-see-what-happens-trials (exp. IV: is the crystal solvable in aqua regia?) and to experiments purposefully designed to answer precise questions (exp. XVI: is the double image produced by the stone due to reflexion or refraction?). Thus, the notion ofexperimentumstill is considerably broader than the modern concept of the experiment. The exposition of the variousexperimentaoften takes the form of a lively first-person narrative, in which the author describes not only his actions, but his reasoning, purposes and even emotions as well (e.g. exp. VII). Other trials are told in an impersonal style so that the phenomena seem to speak for themselves (exp. VIII). The reader is often alerted to important points by expressions such asnotandum vero(exp. VII, p. 13). Sometimes Bartholin makes it clear that he assumes the reader to repeat hisexperimenta(exp. VII, p. 13,experimenta haec tentaveris). Addresses in the second person such as this one are not rare. At other occasions, the reader is linguistically promoted to an associate of the author by inclusive first person plural expressions (exp. VI, p. 8,Cum vero versemur hic in corporis solidi consideratione …, ""But since we are here considering a solid body…""). At one point, Bartholin even inserts a diagram of the net of the edges of the crystal, which the reader can cut out in order to build a three-dimensional model for himself (exp. V, p. 7).Bartholin writes a neat, precise Latin that makes the complex issues he describes and analyzes comparatively easy to grasp. Longer periods arise sometimes from a desire to pack an entire chain of thought into one single sentence (e.g. pp. 45–46), but they remain as a rule well intellegible, too. The most important neologism coined by the author is the Greco-Latindisdiaclasticus(δισδιακλαστικός), figuring already in the title and being explained on p. 29, of which the modern ""birefractive"" or ""birefringent"" is a loan translation.",Mieleitner 1922(German translation)Brandt 1959(English translation),"Bartholin, Rasmus‎(← links)","Bartholin, Rasmus:Experimenta crystalli Islandici disdiaclastici, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Experimenta_crystalli_Islandici_disdiaclastici(last revision: 24.06.2021).","Most experiments are told in jussive subjunctive, i.e. the reader is asked to do this or that to perform the respective experiment correctly.","DB, MK",Yes,MK,

This series of papers would remain his only scientific publications. In the second of the five papers, Fahrenheit communicates a series of experiments on the congelation of water in a vacuum which he conducted between 2nd and 4th March 1721 (Julian calendar). The 7-page report features a brief description of the thermometric scale that bears Fahrenheit's name today.In the introductory paragraph, Fahrenheit outlines the object and the date of his experiments. Before the actual report, he describes the thermometers he constructed and their scale with three fixed points at 0, 32 and 96 degrees (ca. 1 page), as well as his method of creating a vacuum (ca. 1 page). Next, he reports his experiments on the congelation of water (ca. 3 pages). At the end of the paper, Fahrenheit states that the end of the winter cold after 4th March 1721 meant that he had to postpone further experiments. However, the winter of 1722 was too mild, and while the winter of 1723 was cold enough, he was too busy to continue his experiments. Because of the small number of experiments, he does not speculate about the causes, but only reports his observations in order to incite others to do further research on the phenomenon.The paper has a clear structure and is easy to read. For the most part, it is a strictly chronological first-person narrative, with the exception of the descriptive paragraphs on the thermometer and the method where the first-person narrator is mostly absent. The report contains detailed descriptions of how the (freezing) water looks like in each experiment. At each stage, the degrees of the thermometer are indicated. Mishaps, like a burst glass sphere, wrong initial conclusions and conincidental discoveries are included in the narrative: for example, Fahrenheit tells the readers that when he carried a glass cup with ice cold  water up the stairs, he stumbled, and the agitation caused the water to form ice platelets. A strange grammatical feature of the narrative parts is that Fahrenheit uses the imperfect tense (relating repeated or continuous actions in the past) as the narrative tense throughout, even though the perfect tense (relating completed actions in the past) would be the natural choice in many cases.","von Oettingen 1894b, 6–11 (German translation)","Fahrenheit, Daniel Gabriel‎(← links)","Fahrenheit, Daniel Gabriel:Experimenta et observationes de congelatione aquae in vacuo factae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Experimenta_et_observationes_de_congelatione_aquae_in_vacuo_factae(last revision: 15.12.2021).",Possible reasons for the imperfect: easier forms and/or language transfer (German)?,,Yes,IT,

During his time in Greenland, he dedicated much of hisotiumto the study of nature and the Greenlandic fauna in particular. He planned to write a more comprehensiveHistoria succincta Groenlandiaeand already gives a tentative table of contents (p. VIII–X) comprising parts on the natural history, geography, and history of Greenland. Fabricius states that he could not yet fulfil this plan (and actually never did) because he could not find a publisher who would be willing to fund such a work (therefore, he asks for a patron) and is now very occupied in Norway. He therefore decided to publish his findings on the fauna of Greenland.The fauna basically followsLinnaeus’sSystema naturae(although the author occasionally opts for a different name) and lists 468 different species beginning with theHomo Groenlandusand ending with sponges. About 130 species have not been described before.

It was coined by Linnaeus himself as a pendant to ""Flora"" that has already been in use as a title for books describing the natural vegetation for almost one hundred years (Simon Paulli’sFlora Danicaof 1648 is probably the first book of this kind with the title ""Flora""). The Roman goddess Fauna was, however, not as prominently linked to animal life as it was the case with Flora and flowers/plants. She is at times identified with the Bona Dea. In the edition of 1761, a female goddess is depicted on the frontispiece which is not included in the first edition. It is not easy to say if this goddess should represent ""Fauna"" or another goddess associated with nature. This motif features, however, also in other later works (seeSteigerwald 2006, esp. 57f.).TheFauna Suecicacomplemented theFlora Suecicathat Linnaeus had published the year before in 1745. The work is opened by the quotationQuae praesenti opusculo desunt suppleat aetas; [...](“What is missing in this small work, time shall provide”), a quotation from Quintilianus which can be found also in many other publications. After this follows a letter of dedication and the preface. In the latter, Linnaeus stresses the importance of names, because only through them it is possible to communicate experiences As he puts it:Primus enim gradus sapientiae est et erat res ipsas nosse; nomina si perierant, perierat et rerum cognitio.(“For the first step of wisdom is and was to know the things themselves; if the names were gone, also the knowledge about the things was gone.”) 
After the preface, Linnaeus describes theratio operisand gives an overview of the works he had consulted. Then follows a glossary with the most important terms that are used in the descriptions of the single species.
These descriptions follow Linnaeus’s system that he had developed in hisSystema naturae(roughly ascala naturaestarting with humans and ending with “zoophyta”), but the binomial nomenclature for animals was not yet introduced as this was only done in the tenth edition of theSystema naturaepublished in 1758. In the edition of theFauna Suecicaof 1761 this nomenclature is applied. The descriptions are short and often in note form as it is still in modern biological books. After the name and some descriptive adjectives that go along with it, Linnaeus usually gives a list of synonyms and descriptions by other authors, which is then followed by his own description of the physiognomy, habitat, etc.

Two of these orations were intimately linked, contending that the present was equal to ancient times in morals and superior in sciences and arts. TitledParallela morum saeculiandFelicitas saeculi, they were probably delivered at the beginning of the first and second semester (the preface of the second oration is dated 1 September 1617, but in all likelihood, this date refers to the time of printing). Both orations rejected the glorification of the past over the present: while the first had maintained that the vices of the present had also occurred in the past, the second argued that the state of the sciences and arts of the present surpassed that of antiquity.TheFelicitas saeculiis an epideictic oration, but follows thequaestiomodel of the disputation. Embedded into a brief introduction and peroration, a succession ofexemplademonstrates the superiority of the present sciences and arts. Each time, the ancient achievements are contrasted with modern inventions, illustrating the progress in the respective field of knowledge. The examples can be roughly divided into three groups: rhetorics, theology and law (fol. B1v–B3v); medicine and the mathematical disciplines (fol. B3v–C2r: medicine, biology, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, geometry, cartography, music); and finally, the mechanical arts (fol. C2r–E2r: mechanics, architecture, warfare, seafaring, watchmaking, magnets, automats and flying devices, printing, paper production, ceramics and glass, diving, textile production, painting, agriculture).  Through his choice of examples, Dornau advocates a broad concept of knowledge and upgrades the mechanical arts, integrating them into the humanist canon of knowledge (cf.Seidel 1994, 297–306).Dornau's oration is an elegantly rhetorized piece of Latin literature, abounding in pathos and rhetorical devices. For example, when the orator describes the rough surface of the moon (which had first been observedwith the telescopeonly a few years earlier), he uses the figures of anaphora, antithesis, homoioteleuton, two tricola, parallelisms and chiasms to highlight the spectacular nature of the discovery:sed eiusdem [sc. lunae] insuper cernere superficiem non levem, ut hactenus creditum fuit, aut perpolitam:sedasperam,sedinaequalem,sedmaculosam quoque, aut, velut terra, ingentibus tumoribus elevatam, profundis lacunis depressam, anfractibus plurimis diductamexistere(""but, what's more, to see that its surface is not smooth, as it had been believed up to this point, or polished: but rough, but uneven, but spotted, or, like the Earth, elevated by huge mountains, lowered by deep lakes, divided by very many bends""). The oration is accompanied by printed marginal notes indicating Dornau's sources.Sixty years after its original publication, theFelicitas saeculiwas printed again in a posthumous collection of Dornau's orations and other writings (pp. 267–307), which, according to the title page and preface, was intended as a model of elegant style for the studious youth.","Kühlmann 1979, 143–145;Kühlmann 1982, 136–188;Entner 1982, 21–27;Seidel 1994, 287–306","Dornau, Caspar‎(← links)","Dornau, Caspar:Felicitas saeculi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Felicitas_saeculi(last revision: 13.01.2022).",,,Yes,IT,

In contrast to many other herbal books theFlorais mostly concerned with beautiful flowers and not so much with plants mainly used asmateria medica. Many of the plants described come from overseas.Ferrari cites many ancient (Theophrastus, Pliny, Columella, Palladius) as well as more recent authorities (e.g.Clusius,Lipsius, Dodoens,Ruel). 
The work consists of four books divided into several chapters. The first book “De apparatu hortensi” explains the fundaments of horticulture and, for example, the use of certain garden tools of which some are nicely depicted. De second book,De florum notis, describes different species of flowers. This part contains some beautiful illustrations of flowers.

It is an ususual work in several respects. Written by a missionary who was no professional botanist or physician (although his father was a doctor) and motivated as much by religious as by botanical or medical aims (the beauty and usefulness of Chinese plants illustrate the greatness of the country itself, which in turn serves to promote the Jesuit mission there), it was nonetheless the first book to introduce European readers to the Chinese vegetation and one of the first in whose titleflorawas used in its modern sense (although the DanishFlora Danicaof Simon Paulli, Copenhagen 1648, was a few years earlier).The work's double motivation is reflected in its structure, as the botanical core section is surrounded by a frame of religio-political paratexts. Both parts are intimately connected; in particular, the botanical subject is carried over to the frame in the form of frequent botanical metaphors (planting and attending to the germs of faith, spiritual cultivation of the garden of China, spiritual growth therein, the tree of the cross etc.)The core section contains some 20 descriptions of plants and their fruits (numbered with Latin capital letters) plus a few more of animals (including mythical ones such as the fenghuang, the Chinese 'phoenix'). Not all of the plants are exclusively Chinese, as many of them also grow in India. The focus on cultivated plants and on fruit trees in particular reflects Boym's wish to highlight China's fertility and general excellence. Each description is preceded by a charming and accurate illustration, handcoloured in many copies, in which the respective plant is labelled not only in Latin, but also in Chinese (in Chinese characters and Latin transcription). The description may discuss the respective plant's (and fruit's) names, appearance, habitat, time of fructification, taste, smell, and medical uses; it may also provide some historical information. However, these aspects are treated less orderly and systematically than in a normalHistoria plantarum. Instead, Boym focusses on providing a graphic, multifaceted image of his plants and to convey the pleasure they give to the eye and the palate. The pulp of li-ci and lum-yen (lychee and a similar fruit, D/E), for instance,est coloris unguinum humanorum(""has the colour of human fingernails""). The pi-pa (loquat, I)nostratia pruna sapore imitatur(""emulates the taste of our plums""). The cieu ko (K)inassuetis cimicum fetorum videtur redolere, revera tamen aromaticum, acutum odorem fragrat(""seems to stink like bugs to the unexperienced, but it really emits a spicy and poignant scent""). Of the tree called su-pim (Diospyros kaki, M), Boym writes:Arbor onerata purpureis hisce pomis gratissimum exhibet aspectum(""The tree, loaded with these purple fruits, affords a most pleasant spectacle"").The dedicatee chosen by Boym (or his colleagues from Vienna) to promote the cause of the Jesuit's mission in China was the young Leopold I. who had just been elected king of Hungary in 1655 (and was to become Holy Roman Emperor in 1658). Right after theapprobatioby the order's general Goswin Nickel, Leopold is addressed by Boym in a flattering letter of dedication and a panegyrical ellogium (an inscription on paper, so to speak) consisting of a full one hundred chronosticha, each of which indicates the aforementioned year 1655. This is followed by another ellogium praising the Jesuit efforts in China and by a panegyrical poem of nearly two hundred hexameters in praise of Boym; both of these promote China as a new region of hope for catholicism where the losses inflicted by the Reformation could be compensated. Next, there is a sketch of China as a country and its provinces, an address to the reader with some general information about China's exotic flora and a prologue (proloquium), again in the form of an ellogium, recommending once more the Jesuit cause to the reader. After the botanical part, there follows an image and a description of the famous Nestorian stele, a Syriac-Chinese inscription, rediscovered around 1625 near Xi'an, that documents a Christian presence in central/northern China from the early 7th to the late 8th century. Finally, there is an epigram and a last ellogium in praise of Leopold.While theFlora Sinensisfailed in its political goals, the book became popular for its appealing presentation of China's exotic trees and fruits.

TheFlora Suecicais dedicated to Carl Gyllenborg, the chancellor of the University of Uppsala, who had worked for Linnaeus to get a professorship.The introduction describes first the natural geography of the Kingdom of Sweden in this era. Linnaeus then singles out different habitats (e.g. mountains, forests, plains, rivers, swamps, etc.) and gives an overview of the groups of plants that can be found there together with the page number where the single species are described. Moreover, he lists some species that are native in other countries (Russia, England, Germany) but are now also to be found in Sweden. Linnaeus gives several reasons for the publication of this work: He first states that his fellow botanists from all over Europe have urged him to write such a book as a proper flora of Sweden was missing before. He then says that this new work should also be of help to his students who no longer need to write down the names of the plants found during excursions, a task described asmolestus(“annoying”). Furthermore, the work should serve pharmacists as it contains the medicinal properties of plants, and also other Swedish botanists who now have a basis on which they could build on and add further plant species.Linnaeus does not include plant species that he has observed only at one place. He has changed some names not because he thought these names were wrong but because his names are easier and more clear. (Local) vernacular names have sometimes been included. An overview of previous works in chronological order concludes the introduction.The main part of the work is ordered according to the classes of plants. The single entries are quite brief and in note form. They contain the name and synonyms, references to literature, habitat, pharmaceutical use, observation/description, and other uses.The work is concluded by three indices: one of (Latin) botanical names, one of Swedish vernacular names, and another one listing medicinal plants.TheFlora Suecicawas reprinted already in the same year in Leiden.

This small book of 61 octavo pages is the first published work of the Edinburgh apothecary Matthew Mackaile. It comprises a dedication letter, a preamble to the reader which amounts to an attack on alchemy, an introduction into the basics of spagyric (p. 7–18), the description of the Moffat well itself (p. 31–49) and an appendix on the saltiness of the sea (p. 50–61).The topographical part of the description is actually only a short introduction of two pages (p. 19–20): it relates how the two springs had been discovered by a peasant six years ago and had since been attracting sick people; the popular tales about the water's medical effects motivated Mackaile to examine the springs scientifically. The heart of the work is the spagyric analysis of the water, which makes up almost the entirety of the work. Here, the author tries to demonstrate that the water of the well contains sulphur of antimony, saltpeter and ammoniac (p. 20).The spagyrical description of the well is divided into five parts: (1) explanation of the composition of the water (p. 21), (2) proof with reasoning and experiments (p. 21–24), (3) proof that the popular opinion is wrong (p. 24–44), (4) replies to specific objections (p. 44–47), (5) rules for the medical use of the water (p. 47–49).The text is well organised and provides clear guidance for the readers. The structure of the work is explained at the outset, and within the single parts, the points of the argument are often numbered. However, only the last part concerning the medical use of the water has its own heading, which suggests that these practical guidelines were expected to be of particular interest to the readers.An augmented English edition of theFons Moffetensiswas published by Mackaile five years later, in 1664, indicating that the healing waters met with great interest among the local readership.",,"In Alcumistas‎(← links)Mackaile, Matthew‎(← links)","Mackaile, Matthew:Fons Moffetensis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Fons_Moffetensis(last revision: 06.10.2021).","Cumque eorum virtutes et effectus ubique ab omnibus depraedicatos audirem, intenti statem fontes invisendi et examinandi desiderio tangebar, quod neminem umquam convenerim, qui vulgatam opinionem ratione aliqua confirmaret.",,Yes,IT,

The frontispiece of Ortelius'Theatrum orbis terrarumis one of them. Within an architecturally designed framework bearing in its centre the work's title, it features the allegories of Europe (on top), Asia (to the left), Africa (to the right), and America and ""Magellanica"" (left and right at the bottom). The Flemish scholar and diplomat Adolf van Meetkercke composed a hexameter poem of exactly one hundred lines (this is the meaning of the Greek adjective ἑκατόστιχος in the title) to render the frontispiece understandable.The poem's structure, which is made evident at one glance through marginalia, is simple. After a praise of  Ortelius' work in general, which is said to provide a more complete overview of the earth than has been available before (lines 1–24), the five allegories with their attributes are identified and explained one after the other in the hierarchical order implied already by their spatial arrangement in the frontispiece: Europe, dressed as a queen (lines 25–37), Asia, distinguished by expensive dress and an incense burner (lines 28–43), Africa, burnt in the Phaeton crash, naked, and holding a balm twig (lines 44–54), America, given to cannibalism and sleeping in hammocks (lines 55–80), and Magellanica, a kind of bust without arms, trunk, and legs carrying a flame under her chest, who still remains to be fully discovered (lines 81–93). The poem concludes with an exhortation to the reader to leave the frontispiece behind and to engage with the work itself (lines 94–100).While the explanations of the personifications of the three parts of the Old World are easy to understand, the same is not true of the more complex depictions of America and ""Magellanica"". The attributes of America, a club, a severed head, a bow, arrows, and a hammock, are clearly explained, but it is not made clear why the figure, which obviously represents South America, stands for the entire continent, while any reference to North America is missing. (In the map after p. 2, North and South America appear as two equal parts of the New World.) It is also left to the reader to infer, with the help of the same map, that the mysterious ""Magellanica"" represents the hypotheticalTerra Australis, a big landmass in the South, of which Terra del Fuego is understood as being the only part known so far.The poem is composed in beautiful Virgilian hexameters. At line 72, the poet's indignation about the rampant cannibalism and godlessness of America prompts, not only two rhetorical questions, but also a truncated line:Quid non impietas designat barbara? Quid noncontemptus superum?What does barbarian profanity not plan? What notcontempt for the gods?This quite extreme stylistic device imitates the around sixty half-lines found in theAeneid(where, however, they do not fulfil a poetic function but are probably a sign of incompleteness).",,,"Meetkercke, Adolf van:Frontispicii explicatio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Frontispicii_explicatio(last revision: 08.03.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In this respect, the work may be compared to Jan Jonston'sNotitia regni mineralis. Märter wrote it for his students, whom he addresses in his preface (pp. 3–4). There, the author stresses the importance of sound terminology, explains that his text serves the repetition (ruminatio) of what the students have heard in class, declares that he will follow the Linnean system and hints at the appendix (see below). The reference to Linné is programmatical, as Märter always speaks with the highest admiration of the creator of modern biological taxonomy and nomenclature. Even the title of his work presumably is inspired by the LinneanFundamenta botanica.The work is bipartite. Part one (pp. 5–38), titledCharacteres plantarum(""Characteristics of plants""), provide an overview of the various properties of vegetables and of their correct description. Six aspects are discussed: anatomy, stature, habitat, growing season, properties (as perceived by the five senses), and uses. All of these are further subdivided on no less than four additional levels. Part two (pp. 39–52),Systema plantarum, is concerned with classification. In this part, it is explained how Linné constitutes hisclasses,ordines,genera,speciesandvarietates. At the end (pp. 51–52), the theory is put into practice by means of an exempli gratia identification of a given plant (borage,borago officinalis) in seven steps.The rest of the volume is taken up by an appendix which is in fact longer than the main work, namely a description, along with a folding map, of the recently founded Botanical Garden of Brussels (pp. 53–130). The names of the plants to be found in the garden are enumerated in French and Latin.Foundations and Termsis concise, clearly structured and rigorously systematical. The many levels of subdivision result in a compartmentalized text in which syntax is often replaced by layout. The concomitant presentation of contents and terminology is implemented through the italicisation of the technical terms, while definitions and explanations figure in normal print. The botanical nomenclature conveyed to the students – substantives for parts and categories of plants, adjectives for their characterisation – is rich and nuanced. For instance (p. 15), apedunculus(stalk of a single blossom) can beradicalis(sitting directly on the root),caulinus(on the stalk),rameus(on a twig),petiolaris(on the leafstalk),terminalis(at the end of a twig),axillaris(between twig and leaf),oppositifolius(opposite a leaf),laterifolius(beside a leaf),suprafoliaceus(above a leaf),intrafoliaceus(between the leaves),extrafoliaceus(directly below a leaf), orcirrhiferus(at a tendril?).

"Jacobi, Carl Gustav Jacob",Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum auctore Carolo Gustavo Jacobo Jacobi,,1829,Königsberg,Bornträger,After 1800,Monograph,Mathematics,Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum(e-rara),906080,"This late Latin monograph of about 200 pages is considered as a key work of 19th-century analysis. Its title is therefore not promising too much when it announces a ""new fundament"" for the study of elliptic functions. These ""elliptic functions"" (a term coined by Jacobi) are defined as inverses of so-called incomplete elliptic integrals. These integrals had emerged from mathematical and physical problems connected to phenomena such as the harmonic oscillator (a frictionless pendulum), the rotation of a rigid body, or the rectification of ellipses. The last problem was responsible for the functions' characterization as ""elliptic"".Elliptic integrals were studied before Jacobi byEulerin the follow-up tomes of hisIntroductio, theInstitutiones, by Lagrange, and by Legendre who distinguished three kinds of standard elliptic integrals to which general ones could be reduced. These integrals contain square roots of quartic polynomials and cannot be expressed by elementary functions. This made them hard to handle on the one hand, but on the other hand an interesting field of research. From the second half of the 19th century, elliptic functions obtained a much simpler definition, namely as ""doubly periodic meromorphic functions"".Due to their significance in various applications, a better understanding of these functions was desireable, not least in order to make computations in concrete problems feasible. After Legendre's results on elliptic integrals had appeared in 1811 and his treatise on elliptic functions in 1827, Niels Abel and Jacobi competed in finding new insights. This competition lead Jacobi to publish many French and German articles on the topic in Crelle'sJournal für reine und angewandte Mathematik. TheFundamenta nova, written in the old, supranational language of science, are in fact a summary and systematization of these results in the form of a comprehensive treatise.Jacobi's work lacks unnecessary embellishment and is clearly structured. After the title page and a shortprooemium, anindex rerum(table of contents) reveals the internal structure of the treatise which is divided in two major chapters: Chapter I (De transformatione functionum ellipticarum) deals with the definition and transformation of elliptic  functions. Chapter II (Theoria evolutionis functionum ellipticarum) is on various representations and expansions of elliptic functions like Taylor and Fourier series or product representations. The chapters are divided in 27 unnumbered topics listed in the table of contents, each of which comprises a varying amount of numbered paragraphs (66 in total).For example, the first topic (Expositio problematis generalis de transformatione) presents the problem of transforming elliptic integrals of the ""first kind"". This theory is then completely covered in the first 16 paragraphs, including comprehensive tables of various transformations. In the following sections, Jacobi gives his definitions of elliptic functions (sinus amplitudinis,cosinus amplitudinisanddelta amplitudinis). He also  reveals some of their relations (paragraph 18) and the important property of double periodicity. This crucial, later defining, property can only be discovered if one considers elliptic functions as complex functions, that is, as functions  whose arguments are complex numbers, a step which it definitely is Jacobi's merit to have taken.The second part is not only covering Taylor and Fourier series of elliptic functions but also Jacobi's new theta function with which elliptic functions can be represented.The book is concluded by a (rather long) list ofcorrigenda(which a diligent reader has already corrected at the respective places).Jacobi's writing style is very technical, formulas abound. As far as natural language is used, passive constructions (ita determinari posse, ""that it can be determined in this way"" §2) and the use of the first person plural (Resolvamus expressionem [...] in factores lineares, ""Let us resolve the term […] into linear factors"", §4) dominate the exposition. Despite the rather simple language, reading the work without expert knowledge is almost impossible. Even if this condition is met, almost every step requires the active participation of the reader, who is also requested to carry out the (often tedious) calculations himself.TheFundamenta novaare marking a stage of maturation of the theory of elliptic functions (Grattan-Guinness 2005, 428). Jacobi has put their study in its proper context by clarifying that they are functions of complex variables and thereby revealing their characteristic property of double periodicity (the later defining property). Also the introduction of the theta functions is a lasting merit. Although Cauchy's achievements in the realm of complex functions around 1825 had not found their way in Jacobi's treatise, his work was fully acknowledged by contemporary mathematicians. Even after it became somewhat outdated in the 1850ies, when the machinery of complex analysis was fully developed and more general works on analytic functions had appeared, it still served as a source of inspiration for many discoveries made by Riemann, Weierstraß, and others in the second half of the 19th century.","Grattan-Guinness 2005, ch. 31, 412-430Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 7, 50-55",Tabulae Regiomontanae reductionum‎(← links),"Jacobi, Carl Gustav Jacob:Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Fundamenta_nova_theoriae_functionum_ellipticarum(last revision: 06.02.2022).",,FB,Yes,FB,

A quick glance already demonstrates the predilection for Latin in creating theFunebre symbolum: 18 of 26 poems are written in Latin, 2 in Ancient Greek and 6 in French. As several authors contributed more than one poem, the 26 poems were in fact composed by only 12 different authors (in order of appearance): Antoine Mizauld, Antonius Anglus Angelus, Ioannes Perrellus, Gulielmus Philander, Benedictus Perrinus, Ioannes Audigerius, Dominicus Iaquinotius, Jean Mizauld, Fine's sons Jean and Oronce, Claude David, and Ioannes Vezuvius. The most active among them and probably the driving force behind the publication is Oronce's studentAntoine Mizauld, who contributed seven poems to theFunebre symbolum(or six, if you count the poem he rendered both in Greek and Latin as one). In addition, he wrote the 100-verse poemVita Orontiiand a bibliography of Oronce's works which were printed in the same booklet.The poems of theFunebre symbolumare printed very narrowly on 14 octavo pages: one follows the other without any spacing, creating the impression of a single text. The names of the authors, written in majuscules, serve as headings to the poems. Most of the Latin and all of the Greek poems are written in elegiac couplets, the standard metre for funerary epigrams and elegies. However, other metres are used as well, namely hendecasyllables (Perrinus,Omnes morte tua gemunt, Oronti; Oronce Finé,Heu heu, care parens, parens diserte), lesser Asclepiads (Antoine Mizauld,O Mors, ferrea Mors, Mors adamantina; Iaquinotius,Si virtute sua, si ingenii bonis), iambic senars (Antonius Anglus Angelus,Si dignus est caelo omnium sententia), and the combination of alternating hexametres and iambic senars in Vezelius's echo-poem (Siccine de medio sublatus Orontius orbe / privarier tam debuit cito vita?

It contains a Latin poem by Michael Kirsten. In 89 hexameters, the poet from Hamburg enthusiastically takes the reader on a telescopic journey through the universe, led and inspired by Hevelius. The journey takes them to the Moon, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun and the fixed stars. The focus is on the Moon and its landscape which is described according to the terminology of Hevelius. As Hevelius treated the Moon as a mirror of the Earth, the readers find on the Moon a second Italy and Greece, a second Adriatic and Ionian Sea, a second Mount Aetna and Mount Athos. At the end of the poem, Kirsten praises Hevelius, prophesying that after a long life, Urania will crown him with a starry diadem and he will rule over the Moon, where the citizens of the moon will honour him with an inscription in lunar letters that readsHEVELIO LUNAE CIVES POSUERE MERENTI.The tone of the poem is heroic and the sentences are often short, giving the poem an air of energy and drive. An abundance of rhetorical exclamations marks the excitement and emotion of the poet's persona (e.g.O sacras artes! O munera! O secti miracula vitri! O rerum formas!). The whole endeavour is most often depicted in nautical terms, but sometimes it is also framed as a attack on the heavens: much would be unknown, if the divine minds did not break into the castles of nature (si non naturae studeant irrumpere in arces / divinae mentes), and especially Hevelius bears the standards against the stars (Hevelius astris / signa infert). The following passage gives a good impression of the lofty and energetic mood of the poem:... Percurrite nerea, nautae,ducat inaccessas circumvaga pinus ad oras:aërias iuvat ire vias, tenuesque per aurasastrorum volitare, polo stimulante, beataeUraniae comites. Non velox sublevat alisPegasus, haud volucer nostris talaria plantisnectit Atlantiades, nec falsis Daedalus audaxsubducit pennis: vitreo nos lumine sursumtollimur et numeris. Haec nostrae est gloria mentis.""Traverse the sea, sailors: the wide-travelling ship shall lead you to shores that noone has accessed: there is delight in walking the paths of the air, to fly through the mild breezes of the stars, as the heaven sets them in motion, o blessed companions of Urania. Swift Pegasus does not lift us up on his wings, flying Mercury does not bind winged sandals to our feet, nor does daring Daedalus equip us with false feathers: we are lifted upwards by an eye of glass and by mathematics. This is the glory of our mind.""The telescopic journey described in the poem is probably a metaphor for reading Hevelius'sSelenographiaand looking at its many images. TheSelenographiahad many poems in its paratext (cf.In Selenographiam Hevelio-Gedanensem epigramma), but in later poems like Kirsten's, the praise of the work was decoupled from the physical entity of the book and spread in other forms. However, theGedani gloriawas reintegrated into the paratext in at leastone copyof theSelenographia, where it appears between the author portrait and the letter to the readers.Hevelius seems to have been involved in the production of the leaflet, as manuscript versions of all its parts, includingthe poem, are preserved among his letters. Thethankyou letterHevelius wrote to Kirsten for “such an extraordinary and most detailed poem” (tam egregio atque longe accuratissimo carmine) is preserved too: as a return gift, Hevelius sent a copy of (or perhaps some engravings from) hisSelenographia(pagillae nostrae Selenographicae), together with some prints of theGedani gloria. The date of the poem, the autumnal equinox of 1651 (indicated both in the manuscript and in the print), was probably chosen because has astronomical significance and is thus suited to the topic: as Hevelius's thankyou letter is dated 14th September 1651, Kirsten must have written his poem earlier.",Kotarski 1987(on poems in praise of Hevelius),"Kirsten, Michael‎(← links)","Kirsten, Michael:Gedani gloria, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Gedani_gloria(last revision: 31.01.2022).",,IT,Yes,IT,

Purš 2016, 535). It originated during de Boodt’s employment at the court of emperor Rudolph II in Prague, to whom the book is also dedicated. This dedication is motivated not only by Rudolph’s status as emperor and de Boodt’s employer, but also by Rudolph’s interest in precious stones (in the dedicatory letter, de Boodt describes some spectacular items from the imperial cabinet of curiosities). In his short preface to the reader, de Boodt adresses the categorisation of minerals as a centre piece of the work, for which he acknowledges only one predecessor, namelyConrad Gessner'sDe rerum fossilium figuris. De Boodt's arranges stones according to their preciousness, but within that structure, he groups stones of the same kind (e.g. all red stones) together.TheGemmarum et lapidum historiacomprises 294 pages and consists of two books on gems and stonsin genereandin specierespectively: the first book is about a fifth of the whole volume (p. 1–57) and lays out the theoretical principles of the author’s mineralogy, while the second, much longer book (p. 57–249) discusses more than 600 minerals and fossils, starting with most precious stone, the diamond. “De Boodt was the first to study optical properties of minerals, […], he found correlations between density and weight, demystified the formation of fossils, discussed the theory of colours and included the technical hardness scale” (Purš 2016, 537). In principle, he approaches the topic in a descriptive and empirical manner. He is opposed to the microcosm-macrocosm-analogy and the impact of the stars, but his text still is, of course, deeply informed by religion (cf. book 1, chapter 8).De Boodt’s encyclopedia enjoyed great popularity. After the author’s death, two further expanded editions came out in Leiden in 1636 and 1647; a French translation was printed twice in 1644 and 1649.

The book marks a milestone in post-Linnaean plant taxonomy because it seeks to define the higher taxa not primarily in terms of appearance, but of functionality. For Jussieu, each class of plants corresponds to a specific functional blueprint, of which its outward appearance is but an indication. As these blueprints interlock, so to speak, they can be arranged in a meaningful succession (Atran 1990, 203–206).The work starts from a short preface, which inter alia explains that it has been written in Latin for the benefit of the international community of botanists (Omnibus dedita botanicis haec [editio] ideo Latine conscribitur, p. 4) but promises that a French version will be published for the author's countrymen. (This never happened.) The Académie des Sciences and the Société de Médicine contribute two brief summaries based on which it is concluded that the book may be published under their respective privileges. Jussieu's long introduction provides an overview of the current state of the art in botany and explains the perspective which inspires theGenera. The last introductory paratexts are a list of theordinesestablished by the author's uncle Bernard de Jussieu in arranging the garden of Louis XV at Trianon (a model for Antoine Laurent's own system, mentioned in this capacity already in theExposition d'un nouvel ordre, pp. 183–185, 188), a Ramist chart visualizing the relationships between the 15 classes of plants postulated by Antoine Laurent, and a one-page overview of them as well as the exactly one hundredordinessubsumed under them. (Jussieu'sordinesare not the identical with the orders of modern botany but broadly correspond to its ""families"".) At the end of the volume, an appendix contains some additional insights which have emerged during the long printing process. A Latin and a French index of theordines, genera, and synonyms discussed round off the book.In the main part, Jussieu's 15classesare arranged according to the number of germ layers and petals and to the position of stamina and corolla in the respective plants. Below the class and theordo, an intermediate level has been introduced, but it remains nameless, and the respective sections are indicated by Roman numerals only. The lowest taxonomical level figuring in the book is the genus: in accordance with his title, Jussieu leaves species and subspecies aside.Each class,ordo, and genus is provided with a description, which is exclusively dedicated to the phenotype of the respective plants. All information on topics like habitat, life cycle, or medical properties, which were standard in older works, is left out by Jussieu. The description starts from the flower and the reproductive organs, to which features most of it is usually dedicated. The style is purely nominal. The description of the common features of the secondordoof class XI, the Rubiaceae, starts as follows (p. 196):Calix monophyllus, superus simplex, limbo diviso aut rarius integro. Corolla regularis, plerumque tubulosa, limbo diviso. Stamina definita, quattuor aut quinque, rarius plura tubo corollae inserta, eiusdem laciniis alterna et numero aequalia.""Calyx one-leaved, simple above, with fringe divided or more rarely whole. Corolla regular, mostly tubular, with fringe divided. Stamina well-marked, four or five, rarely more, embedded into the tube of the corolla, alternating with its lobes and of the same number.""Sometimes,observationesare appended, which discuss the place of the respective taxon in Jussieu's taxonomy, its relation to other taxa, as well as other classificatory problems and open questions. The discussion of theAroideae, the firstordoof the second class, ends with the following questions (p. 25):An Saururus et congeneres huc referendi, an idem de pipere quoad habitum sat simili? Quis in aro cirrhorum usus? An ordini affinis Pandanus?""Should Saururus and its relatives be placed here, is the same true of pepper, quite like them in its appearance? What is the use of the volutes in Arum? Is Pandanus related to the order?""As evident from these examples, Jussieu fully exploits the botanical Latin of the post-Linnaean era (Stearn 1992), which by the late 18th century has evolved into a technical language neatly distinct from ordinary Latin, obscure to non-botanists, and extremely succinct. His book, which presents all plant genera known in his day on less than 600 quarto pages, is a miracle of compression and conciseness.","Atran 1990, 203–206 (see also index s.v.

HisBook for the Pleasure of a Curious Soul(as the original title may be translated) is a companion piece to his great world map, the so-calledTabula Rogeriana. It starts from a cosmological and geographical overview and procedes to describe the surface of the earth as far as it is known to the well-travelled author. The description covers the northern hemisphere (the only part of the world which is inhabited according to al-Idrīsī) and is divided into seven bands, calledclimatain the Latin translation, each of which comprises regions of approximately the same latitude and is subdivided into ten parts arranged from west to east. Topics discussed include physical geography, climate, flora and fauna, cities, populace, customs, and commerce. For countries well-known to the author, the description tends to degenerate into an itinerary, as numerous settlements and the distances between them are listed, leaving little room for anything else (e.g.clima4, part 7).In 1592, the Arabic textwas printed in Rome(modern edition:Bombaci et al. 1970–1984). A quarter of a century later, the two learned Maronites Gabriel Sionita and Johannes Hesronita, the first of which was professor of Syrian and Arabic at the Sorbonne, made the work known to the Western. At the instigation of the historian and polymath Jacques du Thou, they elaborated a Latin translation, which was published, with the help of Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (Miller 2013, 146), in 1619 at Paris. The book's dedication to Guillaume du Vair, an educated lawyer and statesman, informs about the development history of the translation (fol. Aijv) and praises al-Idrīsī'sfacilis methodus(perhaps ""intuitive structure"", fol. Aiijv) and his style full oflepor(""charm"", fol. Aiv r). The letter to the reader complains that the Arabic manuscript and the print based on it are corrupt in many places. Where emendation and translation proved impossible, the translators chose to retain the original expression in Arabic script (fol. Br; this happens above all in the European portions, e.g.clima5, part 4). Some information on measurements of length is given and the reader is warned that Arabic has no word for ""peninsula"", wherefore such topographic features are rendered asinsula(fol. Bv). Finally, the translators speculate about the lifetime (mid-12th century), religion (Christian) and homeland (Nubia) of al-Idrīsī, whose name they ignore (fols. Bv–Bijv). The latter two guesses are erroneous, but the philological argument made for the author’s being a Christian is interesting, while his alleged homeland earned the translation its title. Finally, the translation is introduced by a separately paginated essay about some cities and customs of the Near East and followed by an index.The translation proper fills 278 quarto pages. Its Latin is simple and characterized by a high proportion of paratactic phrases linked byet,atqueand-que. Given the predilection for hypotactic constructions in educated Latin and for parataxis in Semitic languages, this feature in all probability reflects the syntax of the original. The contrast with the elaborate periods of the dedication and the preface is telling in this respect. Some other features may be Arabisms too, for example the substitution ofcum terraforterraeand ofdefor the expectedinas well as the unconcerned word repetition in the following passage (p. 53):Cum terra Mahra iunguntur a septentrione regiones Oman, et de regionibus Oman sunt duae urbes Tsur et Cqelhat, atque haec sita est ad oras maris salsi Persici, distantque abinvicem hae duae urbes longa statione itinere terrestri, maritimo vero minus.""On the country of Mahra, the regions of Oman boarder at the north side, and in the regions of Oman, there are the two cities Tsur and Cqelhat, and the latter is situated at the coast of the salty Persian Gulf, and these two cities are separated from one another by a long day's journey by land, but by sea, the distance is less.""Occasionally, the translators add short explanatory marginalia.

The work achieved a novel synthesis of algebra and geometry and paved the way for modern analytical geometry. It also was the first book whose mathematical notation can still be understood without problems today (Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 309–320). WhileLa géométriekindled lively interest, two factors limited its diffusion: its textual difficulty (recognized by the author himself in an opening ""avertissement""); and its language, French. Both obstacles were overcome when in 1649, the Dutch mathematician Frans van Schooten published a Latin translation in which Descartes' text was equipped with explanatory notes by Florimond de Beaune and with a commentary by the translator. A second and definitive edition in two volumes, which is the subject of the present entry, appeared in 1659 and 1661. The reason why van Schooten (whose role is well described byHoward 2022, 153–154) dedicated his time to the translation of DescartesLa géométrieis his personal acquaintance with Descartes who had stayed in the Netherlands for some time.As the title page informs the reader, the work is now equipped ""adorned by many superb additions that help to explain it in greater detail and to amplify the excellence of thisGeometry"". Indeed, the c. 100 pages of the French original have become close to 1000 in this editorialtour de force. As the table of contents at the beginning of vol. 1 announces, the translation ofLa géométrieitself is followed by Florimond's notes and an expanded version of van Schooten's commentary. Next come five pieces of short to medium length, dedicated to specific problems of Cartesian geometry, namely two short treatises by van Schooten himself and three letters to him, two by Johan Hudde, the third one by Hendrik van Heuraet. Volume 2 (published one year after van Schooten's death), which is introduced by a separate title page and a second table of contents but could be bound together with volume 1, contains five treatises: an introduction to the method of Cartesian mathematics by Rasmus Bartholin, two monographs on equations by Florimond de Beaune, one on curves by Johan de Witt and one by van Schooten on methods of finding algebraic solutions to geometrical problems. (All of these have title pages and introductory paratexts of their own so that they presumably could also be sold separately.) The two-volume collection as a whole is introduced by a portrait of Descartes with a concomitantepigrambyConstantijn Huygens, a dedication to the female philosopher and correspondent of Descartes Elisabeth of the Palatinate and a letter by van Schooten to the reader. This epistle praises Descartes' new method as a quantum leap in the history of mathematics and describes in some detail the genesis of the Latin version and especially of its second edition, explaining how van Schooten came to translateLa géométrieand how he collected and partly translated further contributions by himself and others which supplemented Descartes' work and continued his approach. At the end of the second volume, the reader finds a list of errata, some supplements by Hudde to his contribution, a Latin epigram, and a hexametric Greek dialogue in praise of van Schooten.Van Schooten's translation of Descartes' original treatise is clear, follows the original's structure and wording closely, and precisely renders its meaning. Perhaps van Schooten wanted to give the reader the possibility to compare the French and the Latin, because even the layout of corresponding pages, including the marginalia and the numerous diagrams, is nearly identical. According tovan Randenborgh, it was van Schooten himself to create these diagrams in the originalDiscours de la méthodewhich explains his involvement in this work even better.De Florimond's notes start from explanations of some general peculiarities of Descartes' account, for instance, his revolutionary way of interpreting second and third powers, not to areas and volumes, but all to line lengths and giving thus up the limitations of direct geometric interpretations of such expressions. The power of Descartes' new method results from separating algebra from geometry during calculations and returning to geometry only in the end. De Florimond proceeds to comment on specific passages. In doing so, he goes beyond simple explanations of their meaning and adds numerous further remarks. To a still higher degree, the same is true for van Schooten's lemmatizedCommentarii, which are nearly twice as long as the text ofLa géométrieand carry it forward by means of many additional examples and applications.All in all, then, van Schooten turned a terse and difficult book for mathematical experts with good French into a kind of encyclopaedia of Cartesian mathematics for the whole of Europe. The definitive edition of 1659 was reprinted several times between 1683 and 1695 (Howard 2022, 154) and proved hugely influential in acquainting the mathematical world with Descartes' new perspective on the discipline. One of the most prominent readers of this Latin version isIsaac Newtonwho was deeply inspired by the work (Grattan-Guinness 2005, 61). The huge impact can also be extracted from the fact that its notions and algebraic symbolism formed a standard that has been adopted and used within mathematics up to now. It, therefore, represents an important step in the development of a universal mathematical language.There are several minor works by various authors appended to the book. One of them isDe curvarum linearum in rectas transmutationebyHendrik van Heuraet.","Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 309–320Grattan-Guinness 2005, 1–22van Randenborgh 2012","Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica‎(← links)Descartes, René‎(← links)Methodus fluxionum et serierum infinitarum‎(← links)Schooten, Frans van‎(← links)Primus inaccessum (author portrait)‎(← links)Beaune, Florimond de‎(← links)De linearum curvarum cum lineis rectis comparatione‎(← links)Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam‎(← links)De curvarum linearum in rectas transmutatione‎(← links)","Descartes, René; Schooten, Frans van; Beaune, Florimond de:Geometria a Renato des Cartes edita, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Geometria_a_Renato_des_Cartes_edita(last revision: 31.12.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

Together with theExercitationes geometricae sex(1647), it played a key role in the development of infinitesimal calculus and in the emancipation of geometry from Aristotelianism. Although Cavalieri's decomposition of a geometrical figure into ""all its (parallel) lines"" is a bold action, he was highly aware of the philosophical, epistemological and mathematical implications of his method. Partly in this book, partly in theExercitationes, he is ready to raise and answer all kinds of possible objections.Structure and contentThe titlepage (of the first edition) bears the printer's mark of Ferroni and announces the dedication to Giovanni Ciampoli whom Cavalieri had once visited in Rome. Then follows the dedicatory letter and a preface to the reader where the author reveals some of his motivations: He had asked himself why solids generated by the rotation of plane figures might have different ratios than their generating figures and has thus come to the conlusion to observe in detail what happens in this ""generation process"". Seven epigrams ""to the book"" or ""to the author"" of 4-6 verses each, some permissions (facultas), and a list of errata complete the paratext section.After this, theGeometriais subdivided in seven books with a separate page numbering. The first six books present Cavalieri's first method of indivisibles which relies on the notion of ""all the lines"" (omnes lineae) of a plane figure or ""all the planes"" (omnia plana) of a solid. The plane figures or solids are thought to be generated by a parallel motion of these lines or planes. Cavalieri avoids saying that a plane figure consisted of these lines as he refrains from taking an atomistic view of the continuum. Therefore, the beginning of book II is dedicated to establish that the notion of ""all the lines"" of a figure can be treated as a magnitude in the classical sense and ""all the lines"" of two figures possess the same ratios as the area of the respective figures themselves. The first book treating some more general matter (""about cylindrical and conical sections, similar figures and other lemmas for the following books""), the second introduces the above mentioned method and applies it to triangles, parallelograms and solids generated by them (by parallel plane motion). The third book is on circles, ellipses  and solids derived from them, the fourth on the parabola and related solids, the fifth on the hyperbola and the sixth on spirals. All results presented in the book (areas and volumes of the objects) were previously known but are now obtained by means of the (first) method of indivisibles.Book seven stands out for presenting a second method of indivisibles - the one which is based on what later would be called ""Cavalieri's principle"": If all the parallel sections of two plane figures (resp. solids) of the same height have the same length (resp. area), the figures (resp. solids) themselves have the same area (resp. volume). The separate preface emphasizes the special status of this book among the others and in therein he addresses several objections one might raise concerning the first method like a composition of the continuum out of indivisibles or the ""infinite aggregate"" of, however infinitely thin, lines. His new approach bans all these concepts, for it only compares single lines. Cavalieri has certainly found this more satisfying. The proof of the principle (formulated as a theorem) is carried out by iterative superposition of the two figures (a process which might not terminate, which Cavalieri himself contemplates in hisExercitationes). Then he sets out to prove many of the previously presented results also by this second method.Apart from the subdivision in seven books, these books lack any headings apart from enumerated definitions (in the beginning of the books), propositions and corresponding corrolaries. The enumeration is often times rather confusing andappendicesin the middle of the books do not alleviate the perception of the internal structure. Side notes refer to parts within the work, for exampleC Def. 8. huius- ""definition 8.C of this book"" (p. 11, book I). The first letters of each book and of the preface are rendered as illustrated initials (also in the second edition). Many figures complement the exposition.ImpactCavalieri's attempts to secure his results and his masking of infinitistic methods by traditionalistic style and notions resulted in a difficult-to-read and complicated book. Only few contemporary mathematicians were able or willing to follow the lengthy seven-book-exposition. One of his most prominent readers - and his fiercest critic - was probably professor of mathematics and Jesuit Paul Guldin who raised several objections in hisCentrobaryca(which in turn provoked Cavalieri to an answer by hisExercitationes). Among the most important favourable recipients there isEvangelista Torricelli. In hisDe dimensione parabolaehe worked with Cavalieri's method much more freely than it was done in theGeometria. This resulted in a more ""user-friendly text"" (Alexander 2014, 110) by which the method of indivisibles was spread among 17th century mathematicians likeJohn Wallis(Arithmetica infinitorum). The only justification for the method in Torricelli's work constisted of references to the authority of theGeometria indivisibilibus. So despite its fame and indirect impact on mathematics hardly anyone had really studied the methods of indivisibles by reading the original.","Alexander 2014, 80-118Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008vol. 3, 149-153Edwards 1979, 104-113Mancosu 1996, 38-63",Arithmetica infinitorum‎(← links)De dimensione parabolae‎(← links)Exercitationes geometricae sex‎(← links),"Cavalieri, Bonaventura:Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum promota, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Geometria_indivisibilibus_continuorum_promota(last revision: 12.09.2023).",,,Yes,FB,

The study of geometry – with which he will deal in this work – is especially helpful in this respect and can be useful for many practical applications such as construction, warfare and nautics. Moreover, he stresses that many important figures in history, rulers in particular, fostered mathematics or were even mathematicians themselves.In the following letter to the reader (lectori philomathi ac Mathematico), Finck explains the content and the structure of his work and that it is inspired by thebooks on geometryofPetrus Ramus. To explain the structure of the content, Finck inserts a bracket table that lays out what has been subsumed under the termrotundum. The term has been taken over from Ramus (Schönbeck 2004, 88).
After the letter to the reader follows an appendix to the work of Petrus Ramus that should be insertedat the end of book five of the geometry(Elementa duo Ptolemaica inserenda ad finem libri quinti Rami). It even follows Ramus' style of writing and the formatting of his book including the numbering that is here continued. 
Finck's work comprises 14 books that can be divided into three parts (cf.Schönbeck 2004, 88): Books I to IV deal with the elementary mathematics of circles, books V to IX with trigonometry of planes, and books X to XV with spherical trigonometry. About one third of the work consists of tables of sine, cosine, and tangent inserted between books IX and X. There are also many geometrical figures. The Latin text is well readable although the mathematical parts are written in the succinct style typical of the discipline.The results Finck presents inGeometria rotundarely partly on Euclid's Elements, Petrus Ramus'sGeometriaandRegiomontanus'sDe triangulis omnimodiswhich he refers to frequently. Nevertheless, he adds several own results (like proportions of tangents, sines and cosines which were later assigned toNewtonorGauss,Schönbeck 2004, 93) or his own reasoning or constructions. Overall, the mathematical style is obviously influenced by Petrus Ramus, therefore it does not measure up to Euclidean standards but emphasizes the usefulness of mathematics for practical applications.The work was soon influental and well-known among contemporary geometers asGiovanni Magini,Philips van LansbergenChristoph Claviusor Pitiscus. Its popularity can be deduced from the quick adoption within less than ten years of the Latin terms (although not the already known functions)secansandtangenswhich were introduced by Finck in this work (Schönbeck 2004, 91). Also the previously known termradiussoon became a standard in geometry by its vast use in theGeometria rotundieven though it was not invented by Finck.","Braunmühl 1900, 187-193Schönbeck 2004","Triangulorum geometria‎(← links)Finck, Thomas‎(← links)Geometria Rotundi(redirect page) ‎(← links)Arithmeticae libri duo, geometriae septem et viginti‎(← links)De planis triangulis‎(← links)Mathematici tractatus duo‎(← links)","Finck, Thomas:Geometria rotundi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Geometria_rotundi(last revision: 14.02.2022).",,"DB, MK, FB",Yes,"DB, FB",

Mostly they had been copied many times from antique, islamic and European medieval manuscripts and were full of errors and misleading content. Regiomontanus, trying to get astronomy to a next stage, was aware of the flaws in the astronomical textbooks. The invention of the printing press allowed him to revise and publish the most important works of astronomy and mathematics since antiquity. 
So in 1472 he installed a printing shop in Nuremberg and one of the first publications was the present work: A list of books which he planned to be printed at his shop on a single sheet of paper.The listed works contained the ""classics"" as Euclid'sElements, Apollonios'Conica, collected works of Archimedes, Ptolemy'sAlmagest, Theon of Alexandria's commentary and so on. But also new works by Regiomontanus's teacher Peuerbach (Theoricae novae planetarum) and Regiomontanus himself (De triangulis omnimodis,Ephemerides,Defensio Theonisetc.) appear on the list.According to the list, two works had already been printed: TheTheoricae novae planetarumand theAstronomica, a didactic poem by Marcellus Manilius. Two further works are presented to be almost finished (iam prope absoluta sunt), theEphemeridesand theCalendarium.Regiomontanus's early death in 1476 prevented him to complete his ambitious printing plans. Only eleven of the works on the list he could finalize himself, but many appeared posthumously (e.g.De triangulis omnimodis,De quadratura circuli).

Although it is widely recognised due to its illustrations placed throughout the atlas, theHarmonia Macrocosmica, in fact, represents a detailed account of contemporary cosmological and cartographical findings in their relation to the previous intellectual tradition. This approach determines the structure of Cellarius' argument: he goes from one description of the world system to the other, from one major author to the other, thereby providing his reader with a very broad picture of cosmological ideas from antiquity to his day. Thus, he does not denounce the Ptolemaic model; on the contrary, his task is to introduce the reader to the basic elements of the model and consequently show what constitutes the differences among Ptolemy, Copernicus and Copernicus' successors (such as Tycho Brahe) and what the advantages of the ""Copernican hypothesis"" are. This explains the descriptive character of the work, which, as its title clearly states, aims at presenting the heated debates on the grounds of the universe in a manner accessible for the general public. Considering this, it comes as no surprise that Cellarius' language is clear and quite easy to catch. He tries to avoid complex mathematical and cosmological formulas and descriptions and present the material in an entertaining way; the graphs are also expected to help him out in reaching the goal. At the same time, the beautiful decoration of the book indicates that it must have been worth a lot, which, in turn, makes Cellarius' claim to address the general public questionable.

He characterises his style of writing in thePraefatioas that of a humblehistoricusrather than a „professional“medicusorphysicus. This means that he describes the plants how he found them and adds that he relies on own observation and experience as well as on reliable indigenous sources when discussing the properties of the plants.Rumphius suffered many blows of fate during his lifetime, one of which had a direct influence on this work. As he explains in thePraefatio, the work (on which he apparently begun to work as early as c. 1655) was originally written in Latin, but as he became blind, he had to dictate his texts to a secretary and thus the work was written in Dutch. This should serve also the easier understanding for Dutch people living in the region. It was, however, only published almost 40 years after the author's death by Johannes Burmannus who also translated it (again) into Latin and divided the material comprising originally twelve books into six volumes. Moreover, Burmannus added some new synonyms as well as own observations. Synonyms appear in various languages, apart from Latin and Dutch, also in the indigenous languages of the region as well as at times Chinese, Arabic, or Portuguese. The work is printed bilingual throughout with the Latin translation on the left and the Dutch text on the right column.

The work opens with a short dedication to a certain Dionysios, in which Heron states that it is intended as an introduction to (Euclidean) geometry. The main text seems to fall in two parts. The first (pp. 14–94 H.) is a series of definitions and explanations of geometrical entities, starting from point and line, progressing via plane figures and solid bodies to questions of the infinite and of commensurability and closing with units of measurement. The second part (pp. 96–168 H.) cannot originally have belonged to the same work. It rather is a Neoplatonic introduction to geometry (cf. e.g. p. 114.5 H. [fol. 19v of Dasypodius' translation], where Porphyrius is cited) dealing inter alia with its axiomatic structure and its neighbouring disciplines.In 1570, the Swiss mathematician and teacher at the Protestant gymnasium of Strasbourg Konrad Dasypodius had an abridged Latin translation of the first part printed as an appendix to an edition of the first book of Euclid'sElements. Nine years later, he published a longer version of theDefinitions, which also includes the second part, as the midsection of a volume starting from hisOratio de disciplinis mathematicisand concluded by hisΛΕΞΙΚΟΝ (Lexikon) seu dictionarium mathematicum(whose make is broadly similar to Heron's work and may have been inspired by it). The collection as a whole provides an exhortation the study of mathematics combined with some elementary tools for beginners and may well have been conceived for use at the gymnasium where Dasypodius taught. The translation of theDefinitionsis introduced by a letter of dedication to Nicolaus Kooss, chancellor to the king of Denmark, which begins by highlighting the work's didactic nature, by a few words of praise from Johannes Sturm, director of gymnasium at Strasbourg, and a table of contents.The title of the 1579 translation,Hieron's Directory of Words from Geometry, exhibits two glaring changes with respect to the Greek original: Perhaps through an association with Hieron II of Syracuse, patron of the famous mathematician Archimedes, Heron becomes Hieron. (In the 1570 translation, the title page shows the correct form, but the title of the work itself, on fol. 55v, has Hieron.) The failure to translate Ὅροι (Definitions) makes the work look like a technical dictionary instead of the introductory textbook promised by the Greek title. (In fact, it combines traits of both genres.) The two parts of the Ὅροι are typographically set apart from one another, which may or may not imply a recognition of their different character and origin. The second part is titledAltera Onomastici pars. Definitio geometriae(fol. 15r). In contrast to the 1570 translation and to the manuscript tradition, the first part is subdivided into ten chapters. The translation itself still does not render the whole text of the Greek original, be it that Dasypodius' manuscript was incomplete or that he left out on purpose some parts which he found unimportant. For instance, the final paragraphs of both parts (86.21–94.27 and 166.4–168.12 H.) are missing. The original translation has been thoroughly revised throughout. Changes of wording, word order and construction occur in nearly every sentence. This is evident, for instance, in the last paragraph of part one (1570, fol. 75r; 1579, fol. 15r), where Dasypodius also changed his mind about the grammatical gender of the measure of length σχοῖνος (from feminine to masculine; in fact, both genders are attested). Still, the translation is not always as clear as desirable. When distinguishing simple and composed figures, for instance, Dasypodius writes (fol. 5r):Simplices sunt, quae ex lineis compositae non sunt, compositae, quae ex lineis constant.(""Simple figures are such as are not composed of lines, composed one such as consist of lines."") The Greek original (p. 32.1–3) explains a little (though not much) clearer that the former are made up of one single line only, the latter, of several: ἀσύνθετα μὲν οὖν ἐστι τὰ μὴ συκείμενα ἐκ γραμμῶν, σύνθετα δὲ τὰ ἐκ γραμμῶν συγκείμενα.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 3, 585Schmidt 1898","Dasypodius, Konrad‎(← links)ΛΕΞΙΚΟΝ (Lexikon) seu dictionarium mathematicum‎(← links)Oratio de disciplinis mathematicis (Dasypodius)‎(← links)Heron Alexandrinus‎(← links)","Heron Alexandrinus; Dasypodius, Konrad:Hieronis Alexandrini nomenclatura vocabulorum geometricorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hieronis_Alexandrini_nomenclatura_vocabulorum_geometricorum(last revision: 27.12.2022).","Part two (fols. 29r-v in D.s translation; pp. 158–60 Heiberg) features an interesting attempt at explaining the difference between an axiom, a hypothesis and a postulate.","MK, FB",Yes,MK,

After these follow the books on snakes, insects, and animals living in or by the water (e.g., fish, frogs, crocodiles, sea mammals). The last book comprises fabulous or dubious animals such as the griffin, sirens, the phoenix, or the ant-lion.Borchart is in general interested in the Hebrew names of animals and tries to identify them with accounts on the animals in Greek and Latin literature (both from antiquity and more recent ones).

The decision to publish the work was motivated by the desire to help doctors who do not have the means to buy the complete Corpus and to incite other, lazy ones to finally read the original. After some biographical information taken from Pliny, Soranus and Galenus, the body of the book is divided into eight sections. Section I contains general statements and rules of behaviour. Section II is dedicated to prognostics. Section III treats the human body and its functions. Dietetics is the topic of section IV. The next section comprises nosological writings, section VI writings on injuries. In section VII, ""mixed things"" are lumped together, namely extracts fromEpidemicsand theAphorisms. The eighth and last section brings extracts from the letters. At the end, there is a table of contents and anindex rerum. Although Burnet is silent about his sources, the structure of his collection points to thebilingual opera omnia edition Frankfurt 1624, in which the Hippocratic corpus is subdivided in the same manner, as a model. This is confirmed by a comparision of his Latin text with the new translation by Anuce Foës featured in the Frankfurt edition: Burnet apparently found nothing to change in this version, which imitates the precision and laconism for which Hippocrates was famous (Rütten; Rütten 1998, 27 and 43). Regarding the passages selected, Burnet shows a predilection for case histories and terse, memorable statements (therefore theAphorismstake up a whole tenth of the collection).TheHippocrates contractuswas quite a success, as a series of reeditions stretching to 1765 indicates.  In 1791, the collection was translated into German under the titleGeist Hippokrats(something likeMind,SpiritorEssence of Hippocrates).",,"Hippocrates‎(← links)Burnet, Thomas, Sir‎(← links)Epitome Galeni operum‎(← links)","Hippocrates; Burnet, Thomas, Sir:Hippocrates contractus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hippocrates_contractus(last revision: 06.07.2021).","The abovementioned subdivision of the Corpus goes back to Erotianus, who added a list of Hippocratic works to his Τῶν παρ' Ἱπποκράτει Λέξεων Συναγωγή.",MK,Yes,MK,

It opens a series of 27 publications all bearing the same title (exceptEssay Ibeing replaced byEssay II, III, …, XXVII), featuring a continuous paragraph count and appearing from 1659 to 1663 with Elzevier at Leiden. The author of this series, Johannes Antonides van der Linden, was professor of medicine at Leiden University. As the uniformly recurring title formulaexercitatio …, pro qua sub … vander Linden … praesidio respondebit X(""Essay …, in Whose Favour … X Will Respond under the Chairmanship … of Van Der Linden"") intimates, the opinions presented in the single booklets were publicly defended by van der Linden's students, which event was in each case announced beforehand by the respectiveEssay. The disputations seem to have beendisputationes exercitii causa, that is, training disputations, as no mention is made of conferral of grades. The students no doubt had to pay for the publication, as customary at the time. In exchange, they had the right to dedicate 'their' booklet to one or several benefactors or notables of their choice.The thesis argued for concerns the history of medicine: Van der Linden holds thatthe circulation of blood discovered by William Harveyin 1628 was in fact already known to Hippocrates. By proving this assertion, he hopes to remove theodium novitatis(""hate of novelty"", § 2) which apparently still attached to Harvey's discovery. The cue is taken from a passage in the Hippocratic workRegimen IVorOn Dreams, quoted by van der Linden before § 1, which states that the appearance of strangely looking rivers in a dream signifies αἵματος περίοδον, literally ""a going around of the blood"". (Whatever this enigmatic phrase really means, it certainly is not blood circulation in the modern sense of the word.) Van der Linden's main opponent is Julius Caesar Scaliger, who commented on the passage earlier and gave it a different sense (§ 3).Essay Ifirst explains the question to be discussed (§§ 1–4). This is followed by a discussion on prejudice (praeiudicium) and the damage it does in science (§§ 5–8; the connexion to the main theme is tenuous, but it seems that van der Linden means to accuse Scaliger of prejudice). The account ends with an invitation of sincere criticism from the audience (§ 9). The language is generally vivid and can even become pictorial. The passage from Hippocrates, for instance, is said to ""close every window for doubt"" (omnem fenestram praecludat dubitationi, § 3). A certain predilection for recherché expressions such asexamussitatim(""exactestly"", § 2) sometimes seems to lead to obscurity, but perhaps the typesetter is responsible for part of the respective problems.Van der Linden's idea to divide a monograph into a number of small portions to be defended in as many academic disputations and to print it piecemeal is exceptional. Besides, the present booklet and its successors feature some other exceptional traits. The titleExercitatiowas unusual at a time when medical disputation prints at Leiden were usually calledDisputatio medica(Harskamp 1997). Might it allude to the abovementioned practice of thedisputatio exercitii causa? What Theodorus Colbius could actually have defended in the present text, which contains little in terms of argumentation and is basically just an introduction to the series as a whole, is hard to see. Most enigmatically, there is an appendix of two pages titledΑΛΛΟΤΡΙΟΝ(""Something completly different"") and extolling medicine over physics in a text composed of 94 numbered sentences and phrases. In otherExercitationes, similarly disconnected final sections are calledRespondentis satura positionum heterogenarum(no. VIII),ΕΠΕΙΣΑΓΜΑΤΑ de pleuritide(no. XI),Corollaria respondentis(no.

The author is an obscure figure; even his full first name is a guess. The absence of any paratexts apart from the title page and a handful of errata denies the modern reader any certain insight into the work's sociological setting and purpose.The full Greek text of theAphorismsand their Latin translation are presented on facing octavo pages. The latter is written in a peculiar metre: while most poetic translations of theAphorisms(seeSeidenschnur 1847, 782–785 for a list) are in elegiac couplets or hexameters, van Poort uses a free variant of the Sapphic stanza which allows for an indeterminate number of Sapphic hendecasyllables before the closing Adoneus. Another conspicuous trait is the length of the versions in comparison to the original aphorisms. While the terse and often cryptic sayings of the father of medicine are expanded in most translations, their length rarely doubles and triples, as it does in van Poort's version. The Greek text of aphorism 6.32, for instance, goes as follows:Τραυλοὶ ὑπὸ διαρροίης μάλιστα ἁλίσκονται μακρῆς.Stammerers are most liable to protracted diarrhoea.Van Poort turns this into:Qui parum certas titubante voces / ore supplantat madidaeque balbus / non satis linguae moderatur, illi / maxime ducet diarrhoea longi / temporis alvum.To him who trips up his unsure words with a stumbling mouth and, as a stammerer, is unable to govern well his moist tongue, long-lasting diarrhoea will empty his bowels.In contrast to other translations (for instance, Gérard Denisot'sHippocratis Aphorismi versibus Graecis et Latinis expositi), van Poort's expansion of the original – from six to twenty words in the present example – does not seem to be motivated by a desire to clarify the meaning of the aphorisms. In the present example, the translator does little to explain the enigmatic connection between stammering and chronic diarrhoea. Galen has much to say about this topic in his highly popular commentary (Kühn XVIII 1, pp. 51–53), ascribing both defects to an excess of moisture in the body, but van Poort makes hardly any use of him or his numerous successors. Only a fleeting hint at Galen's explanation is given in the qualification of the tongue asmadida(""moist""). The lack of exegetical effort may be a sign that the translation has not been produced for a didactic setting. This would fit the fact that the complex metre chosen provides little help with memorizing the aphorisms, an important goal of most versions targeting an audience of students. Van Poort, by contrast, who mainly tries to poeticize the text through periphrases, ornamental epithets, and metaphorical imagery, appears to be primarily motivated by strictly literary aspirations.","Seidenschnur 1847, 784–785, no. 53","van Poort, Henricus‎(← links)","van Poort, Henricus:Hippocratis Aphorismi metrica paraphrasi translati, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hippocratis_Aphorismi_metrica_paraphrasi_translati(last revision: 09.01.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,
"Hippocrates,Berigardus, Petrus","Hippocratis Aphorismi rhythmici a Petro Berigardo Florentino, medicinae candidato, eiusdem artis amatoribus dedicati",,1645,Udine,Schiratti,17th century,"Translation, Didactic poem, Other (see description)",Medicine,Hippocratis Aphorismi rhythmici(Google Books),1285856,"TheseRhymed Aphorisms of Hippocratespresent a comparatively late example of the popularity of Latin versifications of Hippocrates' most famous work (Seidenschnur 1847, 782–785). At the same time, they are quite particular on account of the type of verse chosen.  Written by a student of medicine from Florence but printed, for unknown reasons, in Udine, the translation forms the core part of a booklet of some fifty octavo pages. It is preceded by a two-page letter to the ""sincere lovers of medicine"" (ingenuis medicinae amatoribus) and a hexametricalHippocratis encomiumand followed by a series ofEpigrams on the Statues in the Medical Garden at Pisa, which fill 16 pages and praise a number of mythical and historical physicians present in said garden. Among these paratexts, the most important for the understanding of the translation is the introductory letter. From it, the reader learns that the expressionrhythmiciin the title does not refer, as one would suppose, to accentuating but to internally rhyming verses, to be more precise, to so-called Leonine hexameters featuring a rhyme between their penthemimeres (or, more rarely, another caesura) and the end of the line. The translation, Berigardus explains, has been made for mnemotechnical reasons, an assertion repeated at the end of theHippocratis encomium. Given the fundamental importance of theAphorisms, doctors were supposed to be able to quote them by heart on any occasion. Although Leonine hexameters (a typically medieval verse type) are somewhat barbarian in the translator's eyes, they are perfectly suited to that end. Since the author is still a student, one may suppose that he originally composed the translation for his own use.Due to their quite uneven length, the over 400 aphorisms of the collection fill one to ten lines in Berigardus' translation. Passages recurring twice in the original, of which there are a few, are translated on their first occurrence only; after that, a cross-reference is given instead of a translation. The make of the Latin version may be exemplified by aphorism 1.14.Greek originalτὰ αὐξανόμενα πλεῖστον ἔχει τὸ ἔμφυτον θερμόν· πλείστης οὖν δεῖται τροφῆς· εἰ δὲ μὴ, τὸ σῶμα ἀναλίσκεται. γέρουσι δὲ ὀλίγον τὸ θερμὸν, διὰ τοῦτο ἄρα ὀλίγων ὑπεκκαυμάτων δέονται· ὑπὸ πολλῶν γὰρ ἀποσβέννυται· διὰ τοῦτο καὶ οἱ πυρετοὶ τοῖσι γέρουσιν οὐχ ὁμοίως ὀξέες· ψυχρὸν γὰρ τὸ σῶμα.English translation (Charles Darwin Adams)Growing bodies have the most innate heat; they, therefore, require the most food, for otherwise their bodies are wasted. In old persons the heat is feeble, and therefore they require little fuel, as it were, to the flame, for it would be extinguished by much. On this account, also, fevers in old persons are not equally acute, because their bodies are cold.Berigardus' Latin versionCrescenti calor innatus per corpora multus / multa alimenta petit vel membra liquescere sentit. / At senibus calor est lentus, mala copia victus, / nam calor opprimitur multa. Nec talis acuta / fit senibus febris, quia frigent undique membris.English translation of Berigardus' Latin versionIn him who is growing, the copious inborn heat throughout his body requires many foodstuffs or feels its limbs melt. But in the aged ones, the heat is slow, a great quantity of food [is] bad, for the heat is suppressed by much [food]. And the aged ones have no such acute fever because they are cold everywhere in their limbs.As transpires from this example, Berigardus by and large faithfully reproduces the original's train of thought. However, the sense or construction of some of Hippocrates' concise phrases has been modified, presumably in the interest of easier versification. In the second line, for instance, it is the heat, not people growing, like in the original, that feels its body melting. In lines 3–4, the fire metaphors have been replaced by less conspicuous language. Moreover, the causal link between Hippocrates' two last sentences and what precedes is omitted, obscuring the thematic unity of the aphorism. Rhyme is easier to achieve for Berigardus than in vernacular poetry, because, for him, it suffices that the last syllables of the two rhyming parts, not their entire end from the last stressed syllable, be the same. In the last line, on the other hand, the rhyme is more extended but becomes impure (febris–membris).",,"Hippocrates‎(← links)Berigardus, Petrus‎(← links)","Hippocrates; Berigardus, Petrus:Hippocratis Aphorismi rhythmici, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hippocratis_Aphorismi_rhythmici(last revision: 11.01.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Their author was a royal physician to Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV, as well as adocteur régentof the University of Paris medical faculty. His translation remained in manuscript after his death and was only printed four decades later on the initiative and with the financial support of his grandson Jacques Denisot. The book's high aspirations are underlined by its introductory paratexts. The first and last of these are dedications, in Latin prose and Greek elegiacs respectively, by the editor to Pierre Séguier, Keeper of the Seals of France (nomophylax) and one of the most powerful politicians of his time, and by the author to the young Charles IX. In between, one finds eight Latin and Greek epigrams by the dedicatee, the editor, and others, a flattering imprimatur by the dean of the medical faculty, a six years royal privilege – for the editor, not the publisher, which is exceptional –, a portrait of the author with an epigram, and a Greek dedicatory elegy by the author to Charles de Bourbon-Soissons (1566–1612). As announced on the title page, several Latin and two Greek epigrams by Gérard Denisot follow at the end (pp. 156–66).As is customary in early modern translations, the original Greek prose of theAphorismsdoes not feature in the book's main part. Instead, there are 
two poetic versions in Greek and Latin, something found, it seems, only in two more versifications of the Hippocratic work (Seidenschnur 1847, 784, nos. 48 and 52.) Both are in elegiac couplets, the most common metre for shorter poems, and placed on facing pages so that the reader can easily compare them and use the Latin version for a better understanding of the Greek one, if necessary. The two versions always contain the same number of couplets – one to seven, depending on the length of the original aphorism – and are quite close to one another in terms of vocabulary and grammar. One may speculate that the Greek version, which preserves much of the original wording, was produced first and then translated into Latin as literally as possible. Thematically related aphorisms are indicated in marginalia in both versions, providing the reader with some orientation within the corpus as a whole.Not only the Latin but also the Greek rendering is grammatically and metrically correct and pleasant to read, evidencing Denisot's impressive proficiency in both languages. (France was the leading European country in Greek studies in the 16th and early 17th centuries, seePfeiffer 1976, 99–123.) A salient trait of Denisot's versions is their tendency to translate the short, elliptic, and often enigmatic snippets of the original 'exegetically': they supplement information that is only implied in the original and replace ambiguous terms by univocal ones. To this end, Denisot often draws on the ample commentary literature, in particular on its fountainhead, namely Galen's commentary. A good example of this phenomenon is provided by aphorism 7.24, which reads:ἐπὶ ὀστέου διακοπῇ παραφροσύνη, ἢν κενεὸν λάβῃ.After the severing of bone, delirium, if the cavity be penetrated. (trans. W.H.S. Jones)In the Greek and Latin epigrams (pp. 134–35), this becomesἘξ ὀστοῦ κεφαλῆς δι᾽ ὅλου κενεόνδε κοπέντοςἐγγύθι μηνίγγων ἐστὶ παραφροσύνηandExciso capitis dementia nascitur ossein vacuum penetret si tamen usque locumrespectively. Both versions – of which the Greek one is a bit more detailed in this case –  may roughly be paraphrased asIf a blow penetrates the skull and reaches the cavity below (and comes close to the cerebral membranes), this results in delirium.The direct or indirect source of the idea that the aphorism refers to a quite specific bone, namely the skull, and that the delirium results from damage done to the brain, is precisely Galen's commentary on this aphorism (Kühn 1821–1833, vol. XVIII 1, pp. 123–124) which explains in detail why the statement makes sense only if taken this way.","Seidenschnur 1847, 782–785","Hippocrates‎(← links)Denisot, Gérard‎(← links)Hippocratis Aphorismi metrica paraphrasi translati‎(← links)","Hippocrates; Denisot, Gérard:Hippocratis Aphorismi versibus Graecis et Latinis expositi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hippocratis_Aphorismi_versibus_Graecis_et_Latinis_expositi(last revision: 06.05.2023).","For another translation incorporating Galenic commentary, 7.32.",MK,Yes,MK,

In truth, the whole is a conglomerate presumably composed of bits and pieces of more than two original works (Jones 1953, xxvi–xxix). Galen, who was well aware of the composite nature of the material, wrote three commentaries on it which cover the present chs. 1–8 and 9–15 ofNature of ManandRegimen in Healthrespectively (vol. 15, pp. 1–223 Kühn). Having already brought out an edition ofDe natura humanaand its commentary alone in 1531 (Bers 1969, 11), the Dutch humanist Hermann Cruser published a Latin translation of the entire textual conglomerate and the whole commentary trilogy three years later. As customary, the primary text is set in larger, the commentary in smaller font. A passage of the Hippocratic text is always followed by the respective commentary. Cruser also added marginalia to orient the reader.The letter of dedication (fols. 2r–6v) praises the family and the virtues of the dedicatee, the ten-year-old Nicolas of Lorraine, Duke of Mercœur, without unfortunately saying anything about the work's gestation, design, sociological setting and purpose. The three commentaries together with the respective text portions fill fols. 7r–57r, 57v–87v, and 88r–111r respectively. In their prefaces (fols. 7r–14v, 57v–58r, 88r–v), Galen assesses the textual transmission and the status of the three portions. According to him, there originally were two books corresponding to the subjects of the first and third commentaries, namelyOn Human Natureby Hippocrates andDe salubri victus rationeby Polybus. As both of them were very slender, a forger connected them by sliding in a mixed bag of different material, because he wanted to sell the result as a sizeable work to the Attalids or Ptolemies, avid book hunters.In the commentaries themselves, Galen allows himself little to nothing in terms of digressions and is very much focused on elucidating the text. He points out difficulties and uses paraphrases, philological analysis (including recourse to other passages of the Hippocratic corpus and textual criticism), conclusions by analogy, and medical arguments to provide the reader with a correct understanding. His way of working can be illustrated well from his explanation of the first lines ofDe natura hominis(fols. 14v–16v), in which Hippocrates polemicizes against people claiming that man consists exclusively of earth, water, air, or fire, before proceeding to an exposition of his canonical doctrine of the four bodily fluids in chs. 1–8. Galen concedes that Hippocrates' opening statement is phrased ambiguously and hard to understand and goes on to explain – inter alia through an analysis of the meaning of πάμπαν, ""completely"" – that Hippocrates does not negate the presence of the four elements in the human body, but that he insists that these exist in mixed form only. Otherwise, there could be no such thing as a disease, which results from a wrong mixing ratio between the elements.Crusius renders Hippocrates' concise Ionic prose and Galen's often quite technical explanations in mostly intelligible Latin. Sometimes, when Galen recurs to philological arguments, which depend on the Greek lexicon and grammar, he has to expand the text accordingly. It also may be the case that he becomes elliptic and hard to understand in an attempt to follow the Hippocratic or Galenic text as closely as possible. The following passage illustrates both these traits:Εἰ δέ τις ἀκριβῶς προσέχοι τὸν νοῦν καὶ κατ᾿ αὐτὴν τήνδε τὴν λέξιν, ἔνθα φησίν οὔτε γὰρ ἠέρα τὸ πάμπαν εἶναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον, οὐ τοῦτό φησιν, ὡς οὐκ ἒστιν ὅλως ἐν ἡμῖν ἀὴρ ὥσπερ οὐδ᾿ ὅτι πῦρ ἢ ὕδωρ ἢ γῆ, ἀλλ᾿ ὡς τὸ πάμπαν. (p. 18 Kühn)Immo si diligenter animum advertas, in his etiam ipsis verbis, cum dicit neque enim aerem esse prorsus hominem, non hoc affirmat non esse prorsus in nobis aerem nec item ignem aut aquam aut terram: sed non prorsus (πάμπαν Graeci dicunt).(fol. 15r)""But if you pay close attention, also in the following words, when he [Hippocrates] says that 'namely man is not altogether air', he does not contend that there is altogether no air in us, and in the same way no fire or water or earth: but [that we are] not altogether [one of these elements] (the Greeks saypámpan).""",,"Galenus‎(← links)Hippocrates‎(← links)Cruser, Hermann‎(← links)","Hippocrates; Galenus; Cruser, Hermann:Hippocratis De natura humana liber cum commentariis Galeni, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hippocratis_De_natura_humana_liber_cum_commentariis_Galeni(last revision: 25.11.2021).","So the three commentaries in the whole booklet belong together, because the pertain to the three parts of one ancient book (although one created by fraud).",MK,Yes,MK,

This text constitutes the most detailed account of the life of the ""Father of Medicine"". Later Greek lives, in particular the so-calledVita Bruxellensis(6th century), the lemmaHippokratesin theSUDA(10th century) and the life by Johannes Tzetzes (12th century), all depend on Soranus. When the important medical humanist Janus Cornarius produced a very successful one-volume edition of the entireCorpus Hippocraticumin Latin translation, which was printed more or less simultaneously in Venice, Basel and Paris and republished until the 18th century, he prefixed his own translation of Soranus' biography to it. In doing so, he followed the model of the first Latin and GreekOpera omniaeditions (Rome 1525; Venice 1526), as well as his own Greek Hippocrates (Basel 1538).TheHippocratis Coi vitastarts from Hippocrates' ancestry (which reaches back to Hercules and Asclepius), parents, year of birth and teachers. The main part is taken up by the great physician's various achievements, most of which, for instance his cure of Democritus and of the lovesick Macedonian king Perdiccas II, are clearly legendary. After the account of Hippocrates' death near Larissa in Thessaly, his iconography (he is usually depicted with veiled head), authenticity problems surrounding his writings, his noble character as well as his sons and disciples are mentioned in conclusion.Although the biography is quite short (less than two quarto pages), it is densely packed with information. Soranus seems to have conducted some serious research for it, as the phrasequi Coorum bibliothecas perscrutatus est(""who has scrutinized the libraries of Cos"") indicates. Several times, open questions and divergent hypotheses to be found in earlier sources are discussed: Why did Hippocrates leave his homeland, how old (85, 90, 104 or 109 years) was he at the time of his death, why is he depictedcapite velato? The strange fact that the biographer himself is referenced in the third person constitutes either a mannerism which also occurs in some ancient historians or an indication that the text as we have it is a reworked version.Cornarius' translation appears a little more humanist than the one contained in the Latineditio princepsof Hippocrates' collected works. In any case it is correct and follows the original closely. Occasionally, the terse prose of the original is a little expanded in the interest of better legibility. In the discussion of the reasons for the above-mentioned iconography, for instance, the original simply has οἱ δὲ τῆς ἐν τοῖς συγγράμμασιν ἀσαφείας (""some [say], because of the obscure style of his writings""), which Cornarius expands toalii vero rursus obscuritatem scriptorum ipsius per hoc significari contendunt(""yet others claim that the obscure style of his writings is signified in this way"").",,"Cornarius, Janus‎(← links)Soranus, Ephesius‎(← links)","Soranus, Ephesius; Cornarius, Janus:Hippocratis vita, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hippocratis_vita(last revision: 07.06.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Curtz' work on this project dates back to 1647 at least. The initial part was printed as early as 1656/57 in Vienna. Ten years later, the complete book of c. 1150 pages appeared in two parts (with continuous pagination, usually bound together) under the editor's anagrammatic pseudonym Lucius Barrettus.Its first part is introduced by a Liber προλεγóμενος comprising a collection of pre-Brahean observational data and an explanation of Brahe's method. Next come eleven books (one per year) comprising Brahe's observations for the years 1582–1592. The positions of sun, moon, planets and fixed stars are listed chronologically for various days of the year in tabular form, interrupted by short comments regarding, for example, the respective observation conditions, the precision / imprecision of data or the appearance of comets. The observations for 1593 (comprising a very full catalogue of fixed stars), with which the second part begins, are collected from other sources, because Curtz had no access to Brahe's data concerning that year. After that, books 13–20  cover the years 1594–1601 in the usual manner. The work is rounded off with data reaching from Brahe's death in 1601 to 1635, culled from the estate of the Swabian astronomer Wilhelm Schickard, including a number of illustrations.Unfortunately, theHistoria coelestiswas based on an incomplete copy of Brahe's observations and so full of printing errors that it was scientifically worthless from the outset (Dreyer 1913–1929, vol. 10, IV–VI). Contemporary astronomers like John Wallis or Erasmus Bartholin, who listed several hundred mistakes from the 1582 section alone in hisSpecimen recognitionis nuper editarum Observationum astronomicarum Tychonis Brahe, were clear about this. Nonetheless, the book was reprinted without any corrections in 1672. Some 250 years after Curtz' attempt, a good, complete version of Brahe's observations finally appeared in print in vols. 10–13 of (John Louis Emil Dreyer's edition of Brahe'sOpera omnia).",Korenjak 2020(with earlier secondary literature),"Brahe, Tycho‎(← links)Curtz, Albert von‎(← links)Ephemerides‎(← links)Specimen recognitionis nuper editarum Observationum astronomicarum Tychonis Brahe‎(← links)Tabulae manuales logarithmicae‎(← links)","Brahe, Tycho; Curtz, Albert von:Historia coelestis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Historia_coelestis(last revision: 14.10.2021).","Der Titel, der die Entstehungsgeschichte des Werkes referiert, läuft über 6 Seiten.Wie Riccioli im Almagestum Novum irgendwo schreibt (Sedlmeyer, Curtius und Kepler, 166), arbeitete C. an dem Werk schon 1651: „Nunc jussu Caesaris praeest observationibus Tychonis recognoscendis et in lucem edendis...“

It comprises three volumes and over 1600 pages, mostly filled with tables and charts. Containing several hundreds of thousands of numerical data, it was the most comprehensive and reliable work of its kind at the time of publication. The majority of the data reflects over forty years of observational practice at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, founded at Flamsteed's initiative in 1675. The proudly patriotic title is justified in this respect.Vol. 1 reports observational data of planets and fixed stars from 1675 to 1689 as well as planetary positions calculated from that data. Vol. 2, the most extensive one, focusses on data of meridian transits and eclipses observed from 1689 to 1720 (that is, one year after Flamsteed's death), plus, again, calculations of the respective planetary positions. Vol. 3 reproduces a number of historical star catalogues by Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg, Brahe, William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and Hevelius. These lead up to Flamsteed's own catalogue, which lists c. 3000 stars. As a supplement, a shorter catalogue of stars of the southern sky is added. All three volumes also contain a number oftabulae subsidiariae(""auxiliary tables"", as they are called in vol. 2), which explain and facilitate the complex calculations involved.Although some of the tables, esp. the ones at the beginning of vol. 1 which present a number of pre-Greenwich observations, contain some descriptive and narrative text alongside the figures, longer stretches of running text are a rarity. Besides the letter of dedication to George I and a short note to the reader at the beginning of vol. 1, the most important exception by far is the longAd lectorem praefatio sive in stellarum fixarum catalogum prolegomena(""Preface to the reader or preamble to the catalogue of fixed stars"") that opens vol. 3 (pp. 1–164). According to the note to the reader, it was written by Flamsteed in the vernacular and assigned its place within theHistoriaaccording to his wishes. The reason for the unusual placement was that Greenwich Observatory was founded specifically for obtaining a better catalogue of the fixed stars: in this sense, the last volume was the most important part of the entire work. Who is responsible for the Latin translation, remains unclear. As it stands, this text amounts to a history of astronomical observation in general and star catalogues in particular, combined with an explanation of Flamsteed's place in the tradition and his own methods and instruments.TheHistoria coelestis Britannicahad a troubled editorial history (some aspects of which are briefly touched upon in the aforementioned note to the reader). As early as 1712, an unauthorised edition of part of Flamsteed's data had been published at the initiative, among others, of Newton and Halley asHistoriae coelestis libri duo. Flamsteed, who had not checked his data against other astronomers' observations at that time, was infuriated and burned 300 copies which he got hold of in 1715. He did not live to see his own edition through the press. The final version appeared only six years after his death, edited (and slightly supplemented, at least in vol. 2) by his widow Margret Flamsteed and his friend James Hodgson with the help of Flamsteed's former assistants Joseph Crosthwait and Abraham Sharp. That the work was eagerly awaited at the time of its author's death is shown by the ample space dedicated to it inFlamsteed's obituarypublished in theNova litteraria.",,"Flamsteed, John‎(← links)Vita Flamstedii‎(← links)","Flamsteed, John:Historia coelestis Britannica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Historia_coelestis_Britannica(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It is preceded by two brief introductions, one in the form of a letter, while the other one is addressed to the reader. In the firstpraefatio, Borelli states that in collecting information about the eruption of Aetna and reconstructing the chorography of the region, he relies on the writings of his local predecessors; the second one states that Borelli, an active member of theres publica letteraria, circulated and made his findings known among contemporary scientific academies. The opening pages of the treatise are supplemented with a rather detailed index of discussed topics and a beautiful image of the volcano itself.In the main body of the treatise, Borelli argues that those scholars who had previously dealt with the origin of the volcano failed to provide a reliable explanation. According to Borelli, there were two main reasons for that: first, the scholars ignoredhistoria, that is empirical knowledge about the volcano - something, which he intends to fix and even underlines in the treatise's title. Secondly, he claims that ancient natural philosophers completely misinterpreted the phenomenon, which, in turn, affected subsequent interpretations drawn from ancient thought. As an alternative to the existing approaches, he puts forth the idea that the fire beneath the surface of the earth is caused by the presence of certain chemical substances in the soil. The most important of these is claimed to be ammonia. Depending on the amount of ammonia and other similar substances, they can determine the intensity of eruptions.
The publication is supplemented with Borelli'sResponsio ad censuras Honorari Fabriin which he attacks Fabri's plagiarism of some of Borelli's findings.

It is dedicated to count Boguslaw Leszczynski of Leszno whose tutor Jan Jonston was. The volume contains a picture of the author with a Latin epigram by Andreas Gryphius. The scope of the volume is explained in thePraefatio: Jonston wants to describe tetrapods (“de nomine”; “quadrupedia”), their external and internal anatomy (“de partibus”), their habitat (“de loco”), their feeding (“de nutritione”), their size (“de augmento”), their propagation and development (“de generatione”), the duration of their life (“de vita”), their senses, behavior and movements (“de animalibus actionibus”), their use for humans (“de usu”) as well as their categorization (“de differentiis”).The work is ordered according to this categorization sometimes in a dichotomy (p. 7). Jonston starts with odd-toed ungulates (“solidipeda”), then he treats two-toed ungulates (“busulca”), ruminants (“ruminantia”) which are divided into ruminants with (“cornuta”) or without horns (“non cornuta”). After these animals, follow those animals with fingers (“digitata”). These are divided into those that are viviparous (“vivipara”) and oviparous (“ovipara”). These two groups are further dichotomously divided. The viviparous animals in land (“terrestria”) and water animals (“aquatica”), the oviparous in those having a shell (“teguntur testa”) and those that don’t (“non teguntur testa”). Species of the New World are usually seen as variants of Old World species with only few exceptions like the sloth or the armadillo that are treated in a chapter of their own (cf.Asúa; French 2005, 206).
Jonston cites many ancient (including poets like Horatius) and modern authorities. Often, hints at specific passages are given in the margins. With regard to species of the New World, he seems to be mostly relying onNierembergandMarkgraf(cf.Asúa; French 2005, 204). The work contains many cooper engravings attributed to Merian, the father ofMaria Sibylla Merianwho is known for herdrawings of insectsfrom South America (cf.Asúa; French 2005, 204).

3. De lacubus Helvetiae montanis: Liste von Bergseen mit besonderem Augenmerk auf die Fischbestände. – Eigener Anhang zum Pilatussee. Es wird eine ganze Reihe von wunderbaren und schrecklichen Eigenschaften aufgezählt, die ihm zugeschrieben werden. Der Autor hat solche Berichte bei 35 (!) Schriftstellern gefunden. Ein Lokalaugenschein im Sommer 1676 ergibt aber, dass es sich um einen uninteressanten Tümpel handelt, der z.B. auch durch Hineinwerfen verschiedenster Gegenstände nicht dazu zu bewegen ist, ein Gewitter zu produzieren.

1. De Helvetiis
§ 1 De constitutione corporis hodiernorum Helveticorum: Bergschweizer sind größer und stärker als Talschweizer, die zuviel Wein trinken. Schweizer waren früher noch größer. In der Schweiz ist alles groß, Berge, Bäume, Vieh – so auch die Einwohner. Riesen in der Schweiz.
, § 2. De Helvetiorum robore ac fortitudine: Ihr raues Land hat die Schweizer abgehärtet. Ihre Tapferkeit im Kampf (zahlreiche Beispiele aus anderen Schriftstellern)
§ 3. De Helvetiorum longaeva vita: Aufgrund ihrer Lebensweise sind sie gesund und langlebig; manche werden 130 Jahre alt.§ 4. De Helvetiorum foecunditate: Ob coeli clementiam, soli ac regionis cultae bonitatem sind sie auch äußerst fruchtbar. Kinderzahlen.
§ 5. De Helvetiorum ingenio: Manche halten die Schweizer für dumm, das stimmt aber nicht. Liste großer Geister.7. De draconibus. Drachen werden eingeteilt in a) ungeflügelte (ohne und mit Füßen), b) geflügelte. Folgt lange Liste von Sichtungen von Drachen aller drei Arten samt genauen Beschreibungen, Quellen und Sekundärliteratur. Ein einschlägiger Brief hat Eingang in Kirchers Mundus subterr. gefunden.V.

The wordingranae nostrates/Frösche hiesigen Landesin the title suggests that the intended audience was primarly a German one. However, differently to Rösel von Rosenhof’s monolingualInsekten-Belustigung(1746-1761), the natural history of frogs is a bilingual work, with a Latin and German column running parallel to each other throughout the whole book. The Latin and German text correspond to each other exactly. At the beginning of each paragraph, they are realigned to make them run as parallel to each other as possible (for another contemporary historia with a similar layout, see the Latin-DutchHerbarium Amboinense).The natural history proper is 115 pages long and consists of seven parts, each dedicated to one type of frog or toad, with a special focus on their reproduction:rana fusca terrestris/Der braune Grasfrosch (pp. 1-36)rana arborea/Der Laubfrosch (pp. 37-52)rana viridis aquatica/Der Grüne Wasserfrosch (pp. 53-68)bufo aquaticus, allium redolens, maculis fuscis/Die wie Knoblauch stinckende Wasserkröte mit braunen Flecken (pp. 68-84)bufo terrestris, dorso tuberculis exasperato, oculis rubris/Die blatterichte Landkröte mit rothen Augen (pp. 85-96)bufo igneus/Die Feuerkröte (pp. 97-106)bufo terrestris foetidus/Die stinkende Landkröte (pp. 107-115)Each part is subdivided into two chapters dedicated to the external appearance and behaviour of the respective species on one hand and with its internal organs on the other. The text is accompanied by 24 tables with illustrations of frogs, each of which is bound twice into the volume, once in black-and-white and once in colour. The frontispiece displays a withered pedestal with a line from Vergil's fourth book ofGeorgics,Admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum(4.3), with the meaning ofleves resbeing transferred from the bees of Vergil to the frogs and toads of the present book.A preface of the influential naturalistAlbrecht von Hallergives authority to the work. In his patriotic preface, Haller praises the quality of Rösel von Rosenhof’s work and describes him as someone who dedicated himself to natural history because of his love of truth, despite his failing health and without the aid of any patron (Dudum propria veri cupidine unice animatus, inter debilitati corporis varios languores, a nullo aut principe adiutus aut maecenate ad historiam naturalem ornandam accessit.).In his own preface, Rösel states that he was inspired by the work ofJan Swammerdamto study frogs. However, while Swammerdam described only one type of frog, Rösel observed and depicted all frogs and toads in his area. Because of the publishing costs,  theNatural History of the Frogs of Our Countrywas printed fascicle by fascicle: in consequence, Rösel says, the order is not always strict, especially since he was still conducting observations parallel to the publication process. Thus, some might rather call his work „miscellaneous observations on frogs“ than a neat history (opus hoc miscellas potius de ranis observationes quam concinnam earundem continere historiam). Unfortunately, both Rösel's and Haller's prefaces remain silent on the motivation for publishing the work in two languages and the process of translation.The Latin is easy to read, with detailed and vivid descriptions of the frogs, their anatomy and their behaviour. A particularly captivating description can be found in the chapter on tree frogs, where the author describes to his readers how the tree frog hunts its prey (p. 50):Si rana arborea praedae inhiat, eadem id perficit ratione ac rana terrestris: gratius tamen illa eo ipso tempore nobis praebet spectaculum: felis enim instar muri insidiantis praedam intuetur, atque tunc eum servat positum, quem tertia monstrat figura, ubi eandem libellae insidias struentem cernimus. Quando itaque praedam sibi non evasuram autumat, fulguris instar ad pedis altitudinem longitudinemve interdum exsiliens, in illam involat, eandem glutinosa sua lingua arripiens devorat.""If the tree frog is on the prowl, it does so in the same way as the grass frog. However, it provides us with a more pleasing spectacle in the very moment, because like a cat ambushing a mouse, it looks at its prey and remains in the position which is depicted in the third image, where we see it ambushing a dragonfly. When it thinks that the prey will not escape it, it attacks it like lightning, sometimes jumping as high or as long as one foot, snatches it with its sticky tongue and devours it.""Throughout the work, the author is often present in first-person narratives of his observations and insights. Minute explications of what is depicted where in the tables guide the eye of the reader and serve to connect image and text.In the last sentence of the book, Rösel promises his readers to add a short natural history of the local lizards (this also explains the presence of a lizard and a salamander on the frontispiece). However, he was not able to complete and publish this work before his death in 1759.",,"Rösel von Rosenhof, August Johann‎(← links)Svenska spindlar / Aranei Suecici‎(← links)","Rösel von Rosenhof, August Johann:Historia naturalis ranarum nostratium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Historia_naturalis_ranarum_nostratium(last revision: 27.06.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,IT,

It not only contains the first thorough mineralogical description and stratigraphic analysis of a certain region, including some of the earliest geological maps and drawings of geological sections (unfortunately not included in the digital copy; seeOldroyd 1996, 77–78), but also provides a sketch of the history of the earth at large hypothesized on that basis.The work falls into two parts that bear separate titles but are linked by a running paragraph count (part I: §§ 1–211; part II: §§ 212–278) and numerous cross references. The first, more extensive part is in turn divided into two sections (§§ 1–42, 43–180) and two supplements (§§ 181–189, 190–211). Section I provides the aforementioned overview of the mountain ranges of Thuringia. In the historical interpretation of the evidence given in section II, the sea, which is supposed to have flooded and uncovered the dry land several times in the course of earth history, is understood as the major driving force of geological change. The supplements analyze pebbles and tuff respectively as testimonies to the maritime past of Thuringia. The second part of the treatise conforms to the goal of the academy in whose journal it is published, namely to promote useful science. It outlines the possible benefits of Füssel's approach for mineralogists, miners, metallurgists, farmers, builders, well builders and other craftsmen.Füchsel tries to render his complex account clearly understandable by breaking it up into very short units. Most paragraphs are divided into subparagraphs comprising one sentence each and lettered a, b, c etc. Moreover, terminological questions are handled with great care. When the fundamental Latin terms are introduced in §§ 3–5, they are always accompanied by their German equivalents:strata(Schichten),situs(""Lager""),positus(""Stand""),series montana(""Gebürge""),statumen(""Unterlager""). Later on, it becomes even clearer that Füchsel is primarily thinking in the proto-geological language of his native Thuringia (a region with a long mining tradition) and latinizes the respective vocabulary as best he can in the course of writing. Sometimes, the terms are translated into Latin – ""das graue Gyps- oder Alabasterlager"", for instance, becomesalabastrino-argillaceum glaucum statumen(§ 15)– but more often, only a Latin circumlocution is provided.Why a book-lenght monograph such as this appears in the journal of a learned society is explained in a prefatory remark (p. 45). Füchsel apparently could not find a publisher and was offered publication in the journal of the Academia Moguntina, of which he was a member, by one of his fellows, the physician and chemist Christoph Andreas Mangold. In terms of publicity, this was an unfortunate choice, as theHistoria terrae et mariswas little read and its influence on the development of the young discipline of geology remained minimal at the time. Only in the 19th century, Füchsel was rediscovered as an important exponent of early geological thinking.","Oldroyd 1996, 77–79","Füchsel, Georg Christian‎(← links)","Füchsel, Georg Christian:Historia terrae et maris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Historia_terrae_et_maris(last revision: 06.04.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It is also peculiar in that it is cast in the form of an allegorical narrative and combines its didacticism with a panegyric stance. As intimated in the title, the text, which comprises a little over 200 lines, narrates and celebrates the detection of Uranus and its recognition as a planet by the optician and astronomer Wilhelm Herschel in 1781. However, Uranus is called ""Uranie"" by Szerdahélyi – one of the names proposed for the new planet before the scientific community settled for ""Uranus"" – and identified with the Muse of Astronomy called by this name.The story can be summarised as follows: Uranie, the daughter of Uranus, the Sky, and Vesta according to Szerdahély, complains to Phoebus, the sun-god, that she has no place in the sky. Phoebus asks Uranus for his permission to give her one, and as Uranus agrees, Uranie is assigned the region beyond the orbit of Saturnus. The latter, angry to be superseded as the highest planet by a woman, bullies her until she takes refuge with the fixed stars. After a long time, Herschel places her again where she belongs, and the Viennese astronomer Maximilian Hell names the new planet after its goddess.This story is narrated in a quite convoluted Latin full of obscure allusions. To render it understandable, Szerdehály adds mythological and scientific explanations in the form of two sets of notes, short footnotes and 19 endnotes (signed A–S, pp. 15–30) which are considerably more extensive than the poem itself (pp. 3–14).The whole work was published (at least) twice, in 1787 and 1788.

After an introductory chapter on the dignity of astronomy, the work is divided into three sections with 13, 27, and 26 chapters respectively. The first section defines the concept of the spheres and their functioning in general. Section two treats the spheres above the sun, i.e., the spheres of the fixed stars, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. The last section is concerned with the sphere of the sun and those below it, i.e., the ones of Venus, Mercure, and the moon. Fracastoro treats his intricate subject in clear, terse prose and is not afraid of unclassical, even scholastic terms such asimpossibilis. As he explains at the very end (fol. 65v), he deems it unnecessary to have recourse to mathematics – for this, there are astronomical tables, and the educated reader can perform the necessary calculations himself.

"Huygens, Christiaan","Christiani Hugenii Zulichemii, Constantini filii, horologium oscillatorium sive de motu pendulorum ad horologia aptato demonstrationes geometricae",,1673,Paris,Muguet,17th century,Monograph,"Mathematics, Physics",Horologium oscillatorium(Google Books),744030,"This work is Huygens' definitive presentation and analysis of the pendulum clock which he had invented in 1656 and of which he had given a preliminary description in print in 1658, titled simplyHorologiumand comprising only a dozen pages. The newHorologium oscillatorium, by contrast, is a much more ambitious affair, as evidenced already by its paratextual apparatus: It opens with a dedication to Louis XIV., an eclogue of some 280 hexameters (written already in 1665), in which Hadrianus Vallius praises Huygens under the name of Daphnis, and a ""Privilege du Roy"".Huygens own deliberations start from a short narrative of his invention and perfection of the pendulum clock, including a resolute assertion of his own priority in the matter, and an explanation of the connection between the five parts of his subsequent explanations. These five parts – of which the last four provide the mathematical and physical background for the first one – are: 1) a description of the pendulum clock itself; 2) considerations regarding the free fall and the cycloid; 3) thoughts on evolutes and the length of curves; 4) thoughts on the center of oscillation of various geometric figures and bodies; 5) considerations regarding the circular movement of a pendulum and the centrifugal force.Although the problems in the book are ultimately motivated by Huygens' desire to bring the pendulum clock to perfection, the level of abstraction and mathematical mastery is striking: Not only did Huygens use existing methods but he even gained new mathematical results, concepts and even theories. In studying the behaviour of pendula, he recognized that the frequency of a pendulum does not only depend on its mass and length, but also on its displacement from the center. In his search fortautochronouscurves he studied unresisted descent on various paths and discovered this very property of the cycloid which is shown in part 2 (by means of a classical ""Archimedian"" proof of double contradiction). In part 3, the mathematical theory of ""evolutes"" and ""evolvents"" emerges from the natural question how a cycloid path of the pendulum bob could be realised in practice: The bob would be suspended from a (supposedly massless) thread which touches a barrier in the form of the cycloid's evolute (which is, surprisingly, itself a cycloid; cf.Fig. 2). The theory of ""evolutes"" and ""evolvents"" gave also a new approach for rectifying curves, as ""evolvents"" were created by winding off a thread from another curve, thus truly ""rectifying"" it. For finding a ""center of oscillation"" of complicated pendula shapes in part 4, Huygens uses physical quantities which are today's ""moment of inertia"" of a body and he presents the idea of measuring lenth with the help of a pendulum (denying the already known fact of the earth accelleration constantgvarying according to geographical latitude). In the fifth part, results on circular motion from a manuscript from 1659 were published without their proofs. Only posthumously, a full edition (De vi centrifuga) appeared.Unfortunately, the ""mathematically tautochronic pendulum"" turned out to be scarcely relevant for the construction of real clocks: Due to friction and changing oscillating mass of the winding pendulum thread, the errors were larger than those of clocks with classical pendula and little oscillation.All parts are subdivided in a number of propositions and furnished with many diagrams. Despite the very advanced mathematics involved, Huygens appears as a master of clear, concise scientific description and explanation throughout, but especially in the description of the pendulum clock itself. It does not surprise that Huygens was considered as one of the greatest mathematicians of the mid 17th century, bringing the existing methods to absolute mastery. But in his brilliance he would rather reveal the borders of the old methods than create new tools and theories for a further development of the discipline. Concerning the level of abstraction and the usage of mathematical methods for technological research, theHorologium oscillatorumconstitutes one of the seminal works of applied mathematics in the 17th century.","Huygens 1967Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 6, 597–613, esp. 600–609Grattan-Guinness 2005, ch. 3, 33–45","Huygens, Christiaan‎(← links)Tabulae astronomicae Ludovici magni iussu et munificentia exaratae‎(← links)","Huygens, Christiaan:Horologium oscillatorium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Horologium_oscillatorium(last revision: 06.05.2022).",Die 1.

As its model, Virgil’sGeorgics, it comprises four books. The first book (1014 verses),Flores, deals with flowers, the second (724 verses),Nemus, with woods, the third (713 verses),Aquae, with irrigation and water garden, the fourth (830 verses),Pomarium, with orchards. As has already been stated, Virgil is the most important model as Rapin also highlights in his “preface to the learned reader” (Praefatio ad eruditum lectorem), where he gives a detailed account on his poetic practice. The Virgilian model is not only be seen in the elegant hexametrical verses but also in a praise of France that is the equivalent of Virgil’slaudes Italiae, or the Corycian gardener turned into a Parisian friar working with herbs (seeHaskell 2003, 20). Moreover, Rapin highlights the difficulty of writing on gardening in Latin, an ancient language that lacks some vocabulary (Deterrebat etiam me non mediocriter egestas Latini sermonis. Est enim audaciae non ferendae, Latine scribere velle de re apud Latinos prorsus ignorata.).The book on flowers discusses the single plants ordered according to the seasons in which they bloom. Rapin has invented some new myths (such as on Flora [p. 4] or Rhodanthe/Rose [p. 20–22]) that better conform with the morals of Jesuit than many ancient myths. The second book starts with the choice of a good place to plant trees and goes on to describe different tree species. The third book explains how to find a good source of water, different forms of irrigation, wells, aquaeducts, etc. The last book contains not only different species of fruit trees, but especially deals with the cultivation of these kinds of plants. 
Marginalia help to find specific passages and refer to ancient (Greek and Latin) sources. Appended to the poem is an admonition to the reader of Rapin’s way of naming the different plant species. Moreover, there is an index for each of the four books with Latin names for plant species and (in the case of book three) of technical terms together with their French equivalent.
The volume of the first edition also comprises a treatise of horticulture in antiquity compared to contemporary gardens and gardening.","Haskell 2003, 17-69.Monreal 2010.Sperlich 2013(modern edition with translation).","Rapin, René‎(← links)","Rapin, René:Hortorum libri IV, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hortorum_libri_IV(last revision: 28.06.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

Incredibili labore ac diligentia Crispini Passaei iunioris delineatae ac suum in ordinem redactae anno 1614",,1614,Arnhem,"Jansson, Jan",17th century,Historia,"Biology, Other (see description)",Hortus floridus(Google Books)Alternative link:Biblioteca Digital Real Jardín Botánico,914309,"In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Netherlands was a centre of scientific botany, amateur gardening, and bibliophily. The presentGarden of Flowersis situated at the crossroads of these strands. For the most part in Latin, but with some French parts, it addresses both learned botanists and less educated, but presumably wealthy lovers of flowers and books about them. While the meaning of the title caters primarily to gardeners, its language, as well as the medallions ofCharles de l'EcluseandRembert Dodoenson the title page, place the work in the tradition of Dutch scientific botany.TheHortus floridusfeatures 97 tables of copper engravings and some 130 quarto pages of text, printed in an unusual horizontal format. It starts from 20 pages of precise instruction in French on how to colour each and every engraving of a flower in the book. This is followed by a Latin address by Crispin van de Passe the younger to the ""kind lover and admirer of flowers and all beautiful things in nature itself"", in which flowers are praised and the book's design is explained. An important implication of this address is that the young man, aged only twenty in 1614, was the sole author of the text and the engravings alike. (Because his father had built a substantial engraving business in which much work was done collectively, it is assumed in online catalogues and other sources that theHortus floridusis the work of several hands.) The introductory paratexts are concluded by two short elegies in praise of the author and his work.TheGardenitself is divided into four sections corresponding to the four seasons, from spring to winter.  The summer, autumn, and winter sections feature title pages, tables of content, and frontispieces (showing a flower garden in the respective season) of their own: they were printed at different places and by different printers and could probably be bought separately. At the end of the spring section, a FrenchTraité compendieux et abrégé de Tulipansis inserted, testifying to the extraordinary popularity of tulips in the Netherlands of the early 17th century. For the rest, the work consists of a series of numbered entries, each of which comprises a page of text and a corresponding image (or images) of the plant (and its varieties), mostly with names in Latin, French, Spanish, and Dutch/German. A 'complete' entry starts from remarks on the plant's name and proceeds to discuss its appearance as a whole, its flower, seed, root, and habitat. However, some parts are lacking in most entries. The description is not lemmatized but given in running text. It usually focuses on the blossom, which is carefully delineated, with special attention being given to its colours and aesthetic appeal. In the case ofClematidis altera species, the first autumn flower, the blossom is described as follows:Flores sunt magni et admodum elegantes, ab extremis ramulis tenuibus singuli propendentes, quattuor tantum foliis crucis in formam decussatis constantes, purpurei coloris modo ad caeruleum, modo ad rubidum magis accedentis, cuius meditullium occupant quaedam stamina villosa.The blossoms are big and quite attractive, hanging separately from the ends of their thin little stems, comprising only four petals divided from one another so as to form a cross. Its colour is a purple which sometimes rather tends toward dark blue, sometimes towards red, and its midst is taken by some shaggy stamina.As can be seen from this example, van de Passe not only – contrary to botanists of later centuries – writes in full sentences but also uses a lexically reach, not overly technical, elegant Latin that seems to emulate the beauty and delicacy of his subject.The work seems to have been quite successful: an English translation appeared the following year. How intensely some readers engaged with the text is evident from the present copy, to which a Spanish translation of the single descriptions has been added on the back sides of the plates. Written in a well-readable hand and without corrections, this version may have been commissioned by a Spanish owner who had no Latin. Alternatively, it could even have been produced for an (abortive) Spanish edition of theHortus floridus.",,,"Passe, Crispijn van de, the younger:Hortus floridus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hortus_floridus(last revision: 09.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Raphael Thorius' poetic work represents a famous example of a text written in favour of smoking tobacco. His inspiration for putting a praise of a still somehow exotic, but also fashionable herb into Latin hexameters stems from the tradition of Neo-Latin didactic poetry in general and from the example of medicinal didactic poems specifically, first and foremost Girolamo Fracastoro'sSyphilis, which explained the origin of this disease mythologically and presented a newly found plant from the New World as cure. The medicinal background, the mythological implications and the connection to a plant from the Americas made this text a sensible and useful model. TheHymnuswas not issued by the author himself, but printed posthumously with a foreword by Louis van Kinschot, in London in 1626, where the author was a practicing physician, and two years later by Elzevier in the Netherlands, the author's native country. It was reissued in Latin editions in London 1651 and Utrecht 1644 and translated into English in three versions. The first edition is not openly accessible online, but can be accessed via Early English Books Online (EEBO).While on the title pages, the work is calledHymnus tabaci, the author most probably named his workDe paeto seu tabaco, as printed at the beginning of the text. The poem in ca. 1100 hexameters and two books introduces the mythological origins and the medicinal properties of tobacco, as well as presenting instructions on how to plant and cultivate it. The author introduces the mythological origins, the aition of tobacco, at the very beginning of the poem: Bacchus was travelling through India, his Maenads longing for something to quench their thirst. When they found tobacco leaves, they first tried to eat them, but where soon instructed that they should be used for smoking. Since the fumes  restored their strength, Bacchus' followers were able to conquer India. 
Following this mythological opening is a detailed overview of the health benefits of tobacco, which i.a. brings peaceful sleep, helps with fevers and colics and is beneficial for congestion. Similar to the consumption of wine, one should however not overdo it, as it can be harmful when not consumed responsibly. 
Afer a brief discussion of different types of tobacco plants, Thorius goes on to give practical instructions on cultivating the tobacco plant. 
The poem shares many formal characteristics with earlier medicinal and botanical Neo-Latin didactic poems, e.g. the aforementionedSyphilisor Vida'sDe Bombyce. It combines mythological passages with useful practical knowledge and instruction and thus, as the preface states,non delectat modo, sed et docet(""does not only please, but also teach"").",Hypertext edition with translation by Mark Riley onPhilological,"Thorius, Raphael‎(← links)","Thorius, Raphael:Hymnus tabaci, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hymnus_tabaci(last revision: 28.06.2021).",,,Yes,JL,

He was one of the early 17th century proponents of atomism, propagating undividableminima naturaliaas basis of every matter, including human and animal bodies. As expressed in his preface, he wanted to unearth parts of the natural philosophy of Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Empedokles, Leukippos, etc., whom he had studied meticulously. Still, Sennert accepted the Aristotelian idea of form in principle as well as the elements (fire, water, air, earth), which he depicted as being constructed by four different kinds of atoms (fire atoms, water atoms, etc., s.hypomnemaIII). Paracelsian doctrines found their way into this system as histria principia, which Sennert attributed to the human heart (sulphur), liver (salt) and brain (mercury). The force behind the action of these corpuscles is identified as avis formativaorvis plastica, hence not a mechanical cause as in later atomists.HypomnemaIII also treats the possibility of atoms forming concretions (mixta). The last two sections are concerned with the generation of humans, animals, and plants as well as spontaneous generation.

As the book's title suggests, it consists of three major parts, with the last one, some kind of poetic miscellanea, containing 13 short elegies, 6 epigrams and 6 hendecasyllables. It is preceded with an epistle by the author to the bishop of Macerata Domenico Spinuccio in which Garulli advocates the idea of presenting contemporary ""physical doctrines"" in a poetic way thus making it interesting and attractive to a larger audience. The first poem, onCopernicus'shypothesis, is preceded with a note, which states that the decrees of 1616 and 1633 questioned the validity of the Copernican system that should be regarded as one of the possible hypotheses of the world system but definitely not as the only valid explanation. In the stylistically beautiful and sophisticated poem of around 20 pages with the use of numerous references to and borrowings from the ancient poetic tradition, Garulli explains the ""hypothesis"" of Copernicus, whom he addresses in a short hymn embedded in the didactic poem (p. 16). In terms of stylistic features, the second poem entitled simplyCometaefollows the example of theHypothesis copernicana; however, in a long footnote-commentary to the poem with which Garulli seeks to clarify the nature of comets, he accepts and openly praises the Newtonian interpretation. In this case, his position is close to that of his fellow Jesuit scholars such as Carlo Noceti and Roger Boskovic (to the latter Garulli refers several times). In a similar way, in relatively short elegies and other minor poetic writings placed at the end of the volume, he once again acknowledges Boskovic's and Newton's significant contributions to the study of nature and its laws claiming that the new interpretations successfully replaced what he sees as the outdated system, that is that based on the Stagirite. By recognising the scientists and glorifying nature as the perfect manifestation of God's omnipotence, Garulli clearly relies on the tradition established and developed by contemporary Jesuit scholars, which, along Noceti's and Boskovic's writings, makes his collection one of the illustrative examples of eighteenth-century Jesuit scientific didactic poetry.",,"Garulli, Camillo‎(← links)","Garulli, Camillo:Hypothesis copernicana, Cometae et Elegiarum monobiblos, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Hypothesis_copernicana,_Cometae_et_Elegiarum_monobiblos(last revision: 18.03.2021).",,"OA, IT",Yes,OA,

TheHandbook of Iatromathematics, That Is, of Medical Treatment Adjusted to the Logic of Astrology, summarizes some essential information about the topic on 190 octavo pages.After the title page, one first finds a table of contents. The letter of dedication to the author's ""old friend"", the Swiss theologianJohannes Fries, asserts that a doctor without knowledge of astrology will always be at a loss what to do, which claim is bolstered by the authority of Marsilio Ficino. The last introductory paratext is a short elegy by the protestant theologianThomas Venatoriusabout the power of the sun and moon over the human body and the importance of medicine in general.The work itself falls into two main parts. Part one (fol. b r–[h8 v]) first discusses the notion of medical crisis and the critical days as well as other important days (indicativi, ""days of signs"";intercadentes, ""days in between"";vacui, ""empty days"", when nothing special happens) in the course of a disease; after that, it is explained how these days can be calculated and the outcome of a crisis determined astrologically. Part two (fol. i r–[q7 r]) comprises several series ofcanones(""rules""), in which Ryff determines how the astrological situation must be taken into account in medical treatment in general, but also in more specific therapies such as the administration of drugs, bloodletting, or the application of cupping glasses; this is followed by an overview of the properties of the planets.Ryff makes no claim to originality, but presents theIatromathematicae enchiridionas a compilation, as something ""put together"" (concinnata) already on its title page. Within the account, Greek, Roman, and Arabic authorities such as Hippocrates, Galen, (Ps.-)Ptolemy, Julius Firmicus Maternus, Rhazes, Alcabitius, Avicenna and Haly (probably Haly filius Abenragel, but there are several authors called ""Haly"", seeHasse 2016, 370–375) are cited as sources. By contrast, Ryff passes with silence the fact that he has pieced together the whole work from several early modern authors of iatromathematical works such asGeorg Tannstetter Collimitius(Sudhoff 1902, 52–53;Thorndike 1929–1958, vol. 5, 443) – a clear case of plagiarism even by 16th-century standards.The information is displayed in the form of short chapters partitioned into paragraphs whose first line sticks out to the left, resulting in a neat layout. The subdivision of a given topic (e.g., crisis) into a series of numbered sections creates an impression of exhaustiveness. There is almost no discussion and explanation, just definitions and statements. The syntax is simple, the terminology technical, but uncommon words are elucidated at their first appearance; the Arabichyleh, for instance, is defined assignificator vitae, ""signifier of life"" (fol. g r). Astrological symbols are used more and more frequently in the later parts. On fol. [b4 v], a simple scheme outlines the relationship between various kinds of diseases; on fol. f5 r, there is an example of a disease horoscope.The target audience is difficult to ascertain. The title proclaims that the work has been compiledin rei medicae studiosorum gratiam(""for the benefit of students of medicine"") and that its contents arefuturo medico admodum necessaria(""quite essential for the future doctor""). It will indeed have proved helpful to beginners, but its handy format, clear structure and numerous rules may also have made it a useful vade mecum for the practitioner.

On the uppermost level, the text is divided into three chapters titledFundamenta(""Basics"", pp. 3–7),Documenta(""Doctrines"", pp. 7–19), andExperimenta(""Tries"", pp. 19–28). These are subdivided on five to six levels intomembra,theses, short sections and variously numbered paragraphs, many of which only consist on one single sentence or part of it. The argument procedes by definition, subdivision, and catalogues; the latter not only enumerate species falling under a certain genus, but also arguments for a certain position. The Latin is syntactically simple and lexically unscrupulous. Abstract nouns such asterrestreitasorvitrescibilitas(""earthenness"", ""glassificability"", pp. 7–8) are formed ad libitum. Some expressions are paraphrased and specified in German:Inde fluvii, ubi copia lignorum resinosorum vehitur, BRAND- UND BAUHOLZ GEFLÖSSET WIRD, arenae auriferae feraciores sunt aliis.(""Therefore, rivers where much resinous wood is rafted, BRAND- UND BAUHOLZ GEFLÖSSET WIRD, carry more auriferous sand than others"", p. 15).",,"Stahl, Georg Ernst‎(← links)Becher, Johann Joachim‎(← links)Carl, Johann Samuel‎(← links)","Becher, Johann Joachim; Stahl, Georg Ernst; Carl, Johann Samuel:Ichnographia chymiae fundamentalis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ichnographia_chymiae_fundamentalis(last revision: 06.10.2021).","The preface to theIchnographia praxeos clinicaeis a good source on the gestation, purpose, and use ofcompendia.

While the first is devoted to the local insects of the County of Hanau-Münzenberg, the Wetterau and their surroundings, the latter sets out to describe all butterflies of Europe. Each of the three volumes ofIcones papilionum diurnorumconsists of ten plates (adecuria) of butterfly images, accompanied by brief descriptions. The first volume is dedicated to Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden, the second to his wife Princess Caroline Louise, and the third to Charles William, Prince of Nassau-Usingen. Apart from these short dedications, there are no literary paratexts.If one compares the proportion of text to image in Bergsträsser's two periodicals, it becomes apparent that the descriptions ofNomenclaturare often much longer than those ofIcones papilionum diurnorum. Most of these bilingual descriptions of butterflies are shorter than ten lines, as the information is condensed in note form. The first description ofIcones papilionum diurnorumgives a good impression of the terse style of the work:DAPHNIS P. P.

Lives in Austria.""As in this example, the appearance is usually described in a string ofablativi qualitatis, followed by one or two short sentences, or half sentences, about the source or habitat of the specimen, or its relationship to other butterflies. Bergsträsser also notes what he has not seen (e.g. vol. 1, tab. 6.1–2:feminam larvamque ignoro) or questions that he is not able to answer (e.g. vol. 1, tab. 6.7–8:An Alexis scopolici varietas? An Viennensium agrestis?) and provides references to other publications on butterflies.Bergsträsser chose different styles of descriptions inNomenclaturandIcones papilionum diurnorumto accommodate different readerships. In the preface of the first work, he states that the descriptions are detailed because they are written for an audience that does not possess other literature on insects. In contrast, the short and compact descriptions of the latter work are written for readers who are well-versed in the topic already. This becomes apparent in the title, which promises that the descriptions will illustrate and enhance the systems of the followers of Linnaeus and Fabricius (ad Linnaeorum et Fabriciorum systemata tum illustranda, tum amplificanda). AsIcones papilionum diurnorumare directed to an expert audience, Bergsträsser publishes the descriptions of the plates in Latin, the international language of scientific discourse, as well as in German. The different focus of the two periodicals nonewithstanding, Bergsträsser took a very practical approach where their topics overlapped, and reused descriptions and images fromIcones papilionum diurnoruminNomenclatur(e.g. in the case of the aforementioned butterflyDaphnis).The German periodical displays a list of supporters of the endeavour – unfortunately, there is no similar list inIcones papilionum diurnorum.

Some of these portrait books constituted a collection of learned men from a certain field of knowledge. This is the case in Johannes Sambucus’ 1574Portraits of a Number of Ancient and Recent Physicians and Philosophers.The collection brings together 67 famous figures of medicine and philosophy from past and present, starting with Hygieia, the goddess of health, and ending with Sambucus himself. Each portrait is presented in a decorated circular frame. Four frames are left empty, but all are accompanied by the name of the portrayed above and a poem below the portrait. By adopting the structure ofinscriptio–pictura–subscriptio, the portrait series thus resembles another popular bimedial format of the time, the emblem book (in fact, Sambucus had published an emblem book himself). In the dedication letter to the Augsburg book collector Johann Heinrich Herwart, however, Sambucus passes over the epigrams and highlights the authenticity of the portraits instead, as they are derived from statues, paintings, coins and book illustrations whenever sources were at hand.The epigrams comprise two elegiac couplets as a rule. There are only two exceptions: Johannes Cuspinianus, whose praise is sung in three elegiac couplets, and Sambucus himself, who is praised in four elegiac couplets at the close of the book. Several of the epigrams are interspersed with Greek words. The panegyric epigrams praise the contribution of the portrayed men not only to medicine and philosophy, but to the realm of letters and learning in general. For example, Cuspinianus is described as a Vergil in poetry, a Phoebus in medicine and a Livius in history (Carmine Virgilius, medicina Phoebus et arte, / historia immensa Livius alter eras, p. 50). Other epigrams, like the one onVesalius(p. 32), however, reflect more specifically on the progress of medicine:VESALIVS.Quis sine te felix medicus promptusque chirurgus,ni artis subiectum, membra situmque sciat?Saecula tot pars haec latuit, porcum atque catellos,non homines prisci dissecuere sophi.""Who would be a successful physician or a ready surgeon without you, if he did not now the subject of his art, the body parts and their place? For so many centuries, this part (of medicine) was unknown: the wise men of old dissected pigs and dogs, not humans.""In some copies of Sambucus's collection, single pages are missing, as printed portraits were also attractive as collectibles individually.

In this compendium, Severinus explains the theoretical fundaments of Paracelsian medicine and philosophy. After the letter of dedication and a table of contents, he starts with a short chapter (De ortu et progressu artis medicinae medicorumque diversis sectis) on the history of medicine and especially on the radical changes introduced by Paracelsus (Horum vestigiis insistens Theophrastus ille Paracelus nostris temporibus universam medicinam immutavit.; p. 4f.). These changes include the rejection of humorism and the focus on different – from a modern point of view partly incorrect – influences on the body and its wellbeing, like astrology and the use of certain minerals and chemicals as well as his theory of ""elements"". After this further theoretical chapters on the definition of medicine, the role and the foundations of the discipline in nature, etc. follow. Moreover, Severinus discusses topics like the nature of elements, generation and destruction, the formation of illnesses as well as the ways of healing them according to Paracelsian principles.Many chapters end with a concluding statement that is printed in capital letters.
Severinus deals explicitly with the question of Paracelsian jargon. He states that the notions or conceptions of things should imitate the stability of the essences, but that the names themselves are subject to the masters of an art (Rerum notiones essentiarum stabilitatem imitari decet; nomina artificum arbitriis  subiecta sunt, p. 47; cf.Giglioni 2014, 689f.).

It belongs to the Cambridge tradition of tripos verses and was printed alongside another poem for distribution at the ceremony on the first ""tripos day"" in Cambridge, 1731. The witty text starts off with a description of the origin and the behaviour of theignis fatuus(will-o'-the-wisp). It then goes on to describe the superstitious fear of the people, who interpret the nightly lights as ghosts, as well as the dangers of being led astray, which is, however, depicted in quite a humourous way (e.g. the furious farmer who got stuck in the swamp is likened to a clumsy Pan who wanted to embrace a river nymph, but only got hold of the reeds). As the morning sun rises, theignis fatuusfades away.Apart from insisting on the natural origin of the phenomenon, the poem does not seem to be overly scientific, were it not for the surprising turn at the very end.

Already a dispuation of his held in June 1726 was greeted by his friend Francesco Vigilio Grammatica with aCometa poeticus. When Bacchetoni received his doctorate two months later, a collected volume of some 30 pages containing a miscellany of Latin and Italian panegyrical poems was published to celebrate the event. The first contribution to this booklet, and the most extensive and weighty by far, is Grammatica'sShame of Death Vanquished, an epic in some 400 hexameters.The plot is outlined in a precedingargumentum(summary). Grammatica invents an idiosyncratic history of the world from Creation to present, pieced together from Christian and pagan elements (the latter being justified in theargumentumas due to the literary tradition). This history is marked by the rebellion of Mors (Death), against God and the ancient Olympian gods. After Death arranges the gigantomachy and the Deluge, a divine council  decides to promote Bacchetoni to doctor of medicine in order to neutralize her (morsis feminine in Latin). Bacchetoni vanquishes Death during hisdisputatio pro graduand forces her to behave orderly in the future. Grammatica obviously has recycled the basic plot of hisCometa poeticus, extending it to epic length and adding a mythological apparatus. Regarding the idea to celebrate the bestowal of a degree in epic format, it is noticable that a graduation in canon law at Innsbruck gave rise to an epic on the martyrdom of Boethius in the very same year of 1726 (Wirthensohn 2016).Grammatica makes generous use of the structural devices typical of Roman epic. His text starts with a proem and includes numerous battle scenes, ekphrases and direct speeches. The style may be characterised as a baroque variety of epic language. The panegyrical slant, the integration of a specific historic event in a world historical and cosmological frame and the appearance of abstract figures remind the reader of Claudian in particular. A peculiar trait is the sometimes bizarre intrusion of local elements. When the giants break free and attack the sky at the instigation of Mors, their onslaught is described with the help of a bold enallage, an abundance of alliterations, and some names apparently invented ad hoc because of their phonetic characteristics. The classical mountains Caucasus, Pelion and Ossa are joined by Frau Hitt, a butte near Innsbruck (fol. br):Caucaseas Coscus trahit a radicibus iras,Pelion Oegeon rapuit, titubantibus OssamEvellit Tition palmis.

An emblem book was made up of different emblems, intriguing combinations of text and image. A typical emblem consisted of three parts: a motto (title), an image and an accompanying poem. Nature was an important inventory for emblems, often to illustrate moral, religious or political thoughts (cf.Enenkel; Smith 2017). In the 17th century emblem book discussed here, we find a direct engagement with science: the 48th emblem in this collection is an attack, or satire, on alchemists. (Criticism of disputed disciplines can already be found in the first emblem book ever by Andrea Alciati, which contains two attacks on astrologers; cf.Grafton 1999, 240–241.)The title readsIn Alcumistas(""Against Alchemists"") and the engraving shows an alchemist at work in his crammed study. In the elegiac couplet, Schoonhoven lets the alchemist himself reveal the futility of his endevours:Dum certis incerta sequor, rem prodigus omnem / converti in fumos et miseros cineres(""While I was following uncertain things with the help of certain things, I wastefully transformed all my possessions into smoke and miserable ashes."") In this satirical epigram, the alchemist actually succeeds in turning one thing into another, but – as is revealed at the end of the pentametre – he only succeeds in turning his possessions into smoke and ash.In Schoonhoven's emblem book, each emblem is further elucidated by a short commentary. In the case of the 48th emblem, the commentary amounts to a satirical invective against thealcumistica insania(""alchemistical madness""), full of rhetoric vigour and adorned with quotes from Plautus, Ovid, Persius and the Italian humanist Paolo Giovio. For example, Schoonhoven makes fun of their attempts to produce the philosopher's stone, ridicules their terminology and compares alchemists to gamblers, who can't stop gambling even though they keep losing everything.The emblemIn Alcumistasis a good example of how the discourse about science, here about the controversial science of alchemy, could be reflected in a popular genre of Neo-Latin literature. On the other hand, the emblem also found its way into scientific literature (cf. the letter to the reader inFons Moffetensis).",Enenkel; Smith 2017,"Schoonhoven, Florens‎(← links)","Schoonhoven, Florens:In Alcumistas, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Alcumistas(last revision: 26.07.2021).",,,Yes,IT,

The present entry discusses another, very early commentary on this work. TheCollected Remarks on the Ninth [Book] of the Almansorby the otherwise obscure Syllanus de Nigris from Pavia fill close to 350 unpaginated folio pages, printed in two columns and set in neat roman type.The commentary presumably originated as a lecture course on theLiber ad Almansorem. The gestation of the printed version appears to have been somewhat complicated. The colophon states that ""Coradinus Borgomensis [that is, from Bergamo], the famous prince of the natural philosophers and doctors of the whole University of Padua, corrected it for the common good of all with the help of God strenuously and with the greatest diligence"". Perhaps Syllanus died while putting the finishing touches to his text. Alternatively, the dedication to a certainGaleacio vice comitifrom which the book starts could be directed at Gian Galeazzo Visconti (reg. 1378–1402), the first duke of Milan, which would place Syllanus and his commentary 70 to 100 years earlier than the print.The introduction clarifies four general questions regarding Rhazes' book: the reasons for its existence, its title, which part of philosophy it belongs to, and its place in theLiber ad Almansoremat large. Moreover, some more specific information is provided regarding the first section, which deals with diseases of the head. The commentary falls into 92 chapters, which correspond to the chapters of Rhazes' ninth book and are enumerated in a table of contents at the end. Most of them are structured in the same way: First, a general introduction to the respective disease is given by the commentator. Rhazes' text is then cut up into short paragraphs, after each of which follows the commentary proper. To a substantial part, the latter consists of paraphrases whose point often is difficult to see, as they simply restate the author's utterances in more of less the same words, doing little to clarify them or to spell out their implications. In chapter LXV (De icteritia, ""On jaundice""), for instance, the paraphrase of Rhazes' directiveEt syrupum acetosum ex fortissimo aceto in potu sumat(""And he [the sufferer] shall take acetic syrup made of very strong vinegar as a drink"") reads:Ponit curam per potum dicens quod debet sumere in potu syrupum acetosum ex fortissimo aceto(""And he [Rhazes] lays down a cure through a drink, saying that he [the sufferer] must take acetic syrup made of very strong vinegar as a drink""). Sometimes, the underlying reasons for Rhazes' commands are explained. When the icteric is ordered to drink juices made of lettuce and other vegetables, Syllanus remarks:Ratio quia alterant malam complexionem calidam, ex qua fit icteritia(""The reason is that they change the bad hot disposition from which jaundice arises""). Finally, one finds additional comments of a theoretical and practical nature.

The oration was thought to be written byPhilipp Melanchthon, but the finding of a manuscript in Tallinn suggests that at least parts of the speech were in fact written by Rheticus (Frank 2017, 562), the more mathematical passages in particular. At the beginning, Rheticus stresses that he is by nature rather shy and therefore feels a bit uneasy with his new role as teacher and professor. He is rather fond of sciences that “like secretiveness and do not earn public applause” (“Ego enim cum et natura sim timidior et has artes maxime colam quae amant latebras nec merentur plausus in vulgo […].”). He then goes on to highlight the importance of basic mathematics for the education of young men. Arithmetic is important in economy, jurisdiction, and other fields, especially astronomy. Geometry is needed in cosmography and geography. The emphasis on elementary mathematics in this oration is due to his major task in Wittenberg to teach these subjects.The speech contains many citations of ancient sources such as Plato, Aristotle, Vergil, and Horatius.

"Viète, François",In artem analyticem isagoge. Seorsim excussa ab Opere restitutae mathematicae analyseos seu Algebra nova,,1591,Tours,Mettayer,16th century,Monograph,Mathematics,In artem analyticem isagoge(Google Books)Alternative link:gallica.bnf.fr,862097,"Dedicated to the learned princess Catherine de Parthenay, this small booklet not only constitutes the introductory part of a gathering of ten mathematical works by Viète collectively titledAlgebra nova, but also achieved great fame on its own merits for being the earliest work on symbolic algebra.After the title page, a table of contents of theAlgebra novaand the dedication, the work proper is a bare eleven pages long. It contains eight chapters, most of which are subdiveded into praecepta, propositiones or numbered sentences. Referring to the antique sources ofPappus'sMathematical Collectionand Diophantus'sArithmetica, Viète introduces a new organisation of the ""analytic art"" (that is, broadly speaking, the handling of algebraic equations) in three parts: To Pappus's notions of ζητητική (the translation of a problem into an equation) and ποριστική (expressing the general solution rhetorically), he adds a third one, the ῥητική (the expression of its solution by concretely given quantities substituting in the ""poristic"" formula). These Greek notions and the ""new algebra"" are an attempt to free algebra from Arabic influences as Viète frankly confesses in the dedication letter.He sets out to explain his ""new algebra"" which he callslogistica speciosain order to distinguish it from the traditionallogistica numerosa. While in the latter concrete coefficients are given (a term which appears here in the realms of algebra for the first time), thelogistica speciosadeals with general equations of ""species"" symbolized by letters. These ""species"" are quantities with dimensions, and therefore Viète handles questions of homogeneous dimensions with care.In the second chapter one finds axioms for species like in Euclid's ""Elements""; the third introduces the principle of homogeneous dimensions in equations of species. This is fundamental as the quantities denoted by symbols may have various dimension and may represent length, area, volume or higher dimensional species. For example, the modern equation of bx²+dx=g would be written asB in A quadratum plus D plano in A aequari G solido(with unknown A), underlining the dimensions: As A (resp. x) and B (resp. b) are line segments, D (resp. d) must be a plane area and G (resp. g) a volume, as only quantities of the same dimensions can be added or compared. Viète distinguishes the notions ofradix,quadratum,cubus,quadrato-quadratum,quadrato-cubus,et cetera, for powers of species (letters) and the notions oflongitudo/latitudo,planum,solidum,plano-planum,plano-solidum,et cetera, in order to denote the dimensions of the species.Chapter 4 teaches how to reckon with species (using ""+"",""-"" as usual, but also the symmetric operator ""="" for the subtraction of the smaller quantity from the larger). There he uses the termsducere infor the multiplication of two quantities andadplicarefor the division of quantities (where quantities can only be divided by quantities of smaller dimension), the latter denoted like a fraction.In the fifth chapter about the laws of the ζητητική, Viète introduces vowels (A, E, I, ...) for unkown and consonants (B, D, G, ...) for given quantities (""species"") and then introduces the methods ofantithesis(changing sides of terms),hypobibasmus(dividing the equation by an unkown quantity) andparabolismus(dividing the equation by a known quantity) for manipulating equations without changing the solution. This is the first time that variables are used for known quantities. Chapters 6 and 7 treat the poristic and rhetic art, respectively, very shortly. 
In chapter 8 Viète reasons enthusiastically that magnitudes with dimensions higher than three are useful and necessary, for he has discovered the appearance of higher order algebraical equations in the analysis of angular sections.What is revolutionary about the Isagoge is the fact that in it, Viète lays the foundations of a fully symbolic algebra and algebra as a systematic science of equations. In his 1593Zeteticorum libri quinqueViète's ""new algebra"" is applied to many problems and the method becomes clear.

Since its rediscovery in the Middle Ages, the work formed a cornerstone of the medical university curriculum, as becomes clear, among other things, from a multitude of commentaries written on it (Niedling 1924). From the early 16th century, the text was usually read in the translation by Niccolò Leoniceno (1508). The same period also saw numerous attempts at rendering medical (and other) contents more accessible by presenting them in the form of so-called Ramist tables, a device using curled brackets to subdivide a given field, not invented by Ramus but in line with his didactic convictions (Maclean 2002, 60–63).The presentTables and Commentaries on Galen's Art of Medicineby the young classical scholar, philosopher and doctor Theodor Zwinger from Basel are a particularly ambitious example of this trend. The work starts from a long letter of dedication to Johann Rudolf Stoer von Stoerenberg, the humanist-minded abbot of Murbach and Fraulautern, which provides an interesting source for the urge of the era to render teaching more systematic and efficient but is too complex to be discussed in full here. With regard to hisTables and Commentaries(fols. α6v–β2v), Zwinger explains that Ramist tables can be used to compose one's own or to analyse other people's works, as in the present case. His book, he contends, is helpful to get an overview of Galen'sArt of Medicineand as an aide-mémoire. In terms of predecessors and models, there is no mention of Ramus, although Zwinger had met him in the late 1540s. Instead, Zwinger names Leoniceno, Giovanni Battista Monte, and Bassiano Landi, who had been his teacher at Padua (fol. α4r). The dedication is followed by the text of the Galenic work. Zwinger prints Leoniceno's translation, but instead of his 100 chapters, he subdivides it into aprooemium, 50 chapters, and anepilogus, creating an arrangement which suits his own purposes. There also is an index to the Ramist tables (but not to the text).The tables are calledlongae artis compendium(""digest of the long art"") in the full title. However, ""art"" does not mean Galen's work, but medicine at large in an allusion to Hippocrates' first aphorism. In fact, Zwinger's charts considerably expand on Galen’s concise remarks. They comprise 111 folio pages, whereas Leoniceno's translation runs to 31 pages only. Zwinger converts each of the chapters created by himself into a table filling half a page to nine pages.  In doing so, he not only discloses the logical substructure of Galen's argument, but spells out its intellectual context and implications as well. As announced in the title, the tables actually present a kind of commentary, in the wide sense that word had at the time (see, e.g.,Buck; Herding 1975), on theArt of Medicine. In accordance with the elaborate and verbose character of his charts, Zwinger does not use keyword style, but formulates running text in full sentences.That the work was meant not just as tool for a better understanding of Galen, but as an exemplary demonstration of the merits of Zwinger's method of analysis, once more becomes clear from the title, which proclaims it to be useful not only for doctors, but also for philosophers and logicians. The last, it is said, can learn from itartificiosam ordinis definitivi dialysin, which may be paraphrased as ""artful breakdown of a discouse consisting of positive statements"". However, readers apparently were not overly interested in Zwinger'svia regiato logical analysis and didactic success. There is no indication that theTables and Commentarieswere ever used in academic teaching, and no further editions are on record.",,"Zwinger, Theodor‎(← links)","Zwinger, Theodor:In Artem medicinalem Galeni tabulae et commentarii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Artem_medicinalem_Galeni_tabulae_et_commentarii(last revision: 03.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

By its style and the way the material is organised it is clear that the work was designed for being taught at a university: although it presents the whole of the Lucretian poem in great detail, it mostly consists of notes of different length with which Pio comments on particular passages of theDe rerum natura. The work is structured as follows: an excerpt placed in the centre of a book page is surrounded by commentary notes, thus reproducing the tradition of note taking and teaching practices at medieval universities. The commentary was first published in 1511 and reproduced three years later (both editions in Bologna).In the scientific notes, which mostly follow the argument of Lucretius, Pio eventually presents the atomistic tradition supplemented with other elements taken from the peripatetic, Neoplatonic and other 'schools' as a valid method to explore the origin of nature. Unlike some subsequent atomists likeNicolas Biesewho, after exploring the (dis)advantages of different competing schools, go on to give preference to the Lucretian tradition, Pio's approach is more cautious. While, for instance, working through the origins of natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, various medical diseases (to which he devoted a great deal of arguments in Book 6), Pio seeks to combine different approaches to the problem in question, thus, accepting Lucretian basic interpretations but, on the other hand, admitting that the theory of astrological signs might be useful to predict future calamities, and that the final cause of every disaster, something which is crucial for sixteenth-century debates within the Aristotelian tradition, is to bring us to Good.

As a side product of this endeavour, Brożek wrote several epigrams in praise of Copernicus. He appendedsome of themto the three letters on Copernicus that he edited. Others - the epigrams on Copernicus and Columbus and theepigram on Copernicus's observation tower- were printed on single sheets.The two epigramsOn Cosmography's Two Coeval Apples of the Eye, Columbus and Copernicus, are preserved on a single-sheet print that is held at the Jagiellonian Library. No place, year or printer is indicated on the sheet, but - fitting for the astronomical writer and the astronomical topic - there is an astronomical date in the last line (cyclo lunae 4. solis 3. indictione 1.).Both epigrams consist of three elegiac couplets. In terms of the structure, the pair of poems on Copernicus and Columbus seems to be a counterpart to the pair of poemsOn Copernicus and Ptolemy, the Two Miracles of Nature. While the latter epigrams present a diachronic comparison between two figures from the same field, the present epigrams present a synchronic comparison between two figures from different fields, an explorer of the earth and an explorer of the heavens who lived at the same time. However, as the title suggests, Columbus' exploration of the earth (geographiaand Columbus's exploration of the heavens (astrologiacompliment each other and contribute to the overarching description of the entire cosmos (cosmographia).Both epigrams put the same idea into verses: Columbus is famous for discovering the New World and the people that live there (the antipodes), but this fame really belongs to Copernicus - when he set the Earth in motion, it would have been difficult not to discover the New World. In order for this pun to work, Brożek conflates the discovery of America (1492) with the publication ofDe revolutionibus(1543) and makes them appear as (quasi-)simultaneous events. In addition, the publication of Copernicus's model is presented as actually changing reality andmakingthe Earth move.In the end, Brożek never wrote his biography of Copernicus. However, his epigrams are featured in Marcin Radymińksi's biography of Copernicus, which was realised in Cracow in the mid-17th century, but remained in manuscript (cf.Kühne; Kirschner 2004, 164–5).","Biliński 1994;Bitzel 1997, 207–8;Kühne; Kirschner 2004","In Ptolemaeum et Copernicum duo naturae miracula‎(← links)Brożek, Jan‎(← links)In turrim, quam Copernicus incolatu suo et opere revolutionum ibi confecto illustrem reddidit‎(← links)","Brożek, Jan:In duos συγχρόνους cosmographiae ocellos, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_duos_συγχρόνους_cosmographiae_ocellos(last revision: 26.02.2021).",,IT,Yes,IT,"Jagiellonian Library, BJ St. Dr. 14100 III b"

In these years, Barlaeus wrote Neo-Latin epigrams for Falck's engraved portraits of Nicolaus Copernicus,Tycho Brahe,Willem BlaeuandAadrian van den Spiegel. All of these epigrams subsequently appeared without the portraits in Barlaeus's poetry collection of 1646, which features a substantialin effigiem(""on the portrait of ..."") series of over 30 poems (p. 521–37). The Copernicus epigram was taken over from the engraving without any alterations apart from the addition of the titleIn effigiem Copernici(p. 525). It consists of seven elegiac couplets, making it the longest portrait epigram in our database – in Barlaeus'sin effigiemseries, however, the reader will encounter a number of epigrams that comprise six or seven couplets.The first couplet introduces the person portrayed in the picture:Naturae novus iste faber fuit. Aethera, terras / restituit magna cum ratione senex.(""This man was a new artisan of nature. As an old man, he restored heaven and earth with a great method.""). This summa of Copernicus's life is expanded in the second, third, and fourth couplet which describe the Copernican model, a description which culminates in the fifth couplet:Inversa est rerum facies. Humana quid ultra / mens queat? Hic nostri terminus ingenii est.(""The face of the world is turned upside-down. What more is the human mind capable of? Here lies the end of our intellect.""). While the sixth couplet praises the harmony and usefulness of the Copernican model, the seventh lets the poem end with a popular motif, a comparison between Ptolemy and Copernicus:Confudit mundum Ptolemaeus gentibus. Unus / hic verum potuit reddere. Quis potior?(""Ptolemy brought the world into disorder for the people. This man alone could return it to its true form. Who then is more powerful?"").The epigram refers to the portrait only by demonstrative pronouns in the first (iste) and the last line (hic). Between these two references, the Copernican system is portrayed as the epitome of human intellect. The Falck-Barlaeus-portrait might have been the inspiration for Andreas Gryphius's German epigramÜber Nicolai Copernici Bildt, which is thought to have originated at the same time. Although exact relationship to Barlaeus's epigram is unclear, it is possible that Gryphius, by way ofaemulatio, intended his poem to be a German counterpart to the Neo-Latin verses, or even an alternative subscription for the engraving (cf.Kühlmann 1979, 130). Barlaeus's and Gryphius's epigrams thus might testify to the interaction of Neo-Latin and vernacular scientific panegyric poetry in early modern times. Finally, in contrast to the many engraved portraits of living authors, Falck's picture and Barlaeus's and Gryphius's epigrams form the interesting case of a retrospective portrait, celebrating Copernicus as a major figure of science (about) one hundred years after the publication of hisDe revolutionibus orbium coelestium.","Kühlmann 1979,Kühne; Kirschner 2004,Metze 2004","Barlaeus, Caspar‎(← links)","Barlaeus, Caspar:In effigiem Nicolai Copernici, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_effigiem_Nicolai_Copernici(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,IT,Yes,IT,

Diego de Zuniga is believed to have been among the only ten scholars who endorsed Copernicanism in the sixteenth century. He belonged to a group of Spanish exegetes whose works significantly advanced Catholic teaching in the wake of the Council of Trent. Unlike his peers, such asBenedict Pereira, Luis de Molina or Francisco Suarez, he was not a member of the Jesuit order but an Augustinian monk. Although his magnum opus,Commentary on Job, has attracted some interest on the part of historians of science, its literary, humanist and exegetical features have been completely overlooked.The commentary presents an ambitious attempt to shed new light on one of the most obscure and mysterious books of the Old Testament (p. 4). In so doing, Zuniga aims to rely on three extant texts - the Septuagint, the Vulgate and the original - and an array of ""secondary sources"" of historical, literary and philosophical character. In this regard, Zuniga's approach is in line with contemporary humanist trends. Thus, on the basis of the Septuagint and parallels readings of other Old Testament books, he comes to the conclusion that Job was, in fact, arex, which should have resonated with Zuniga's dedication of the commentary to Philip II of Spain. The outcome of a meticulous chapter-by-chapter reading of the Book of Job is a work of over 600 pages, which not only deals with exegesis per se but also touches upon some issues that were hotly debated at that time, including the Copernican hypothesis. In Chapter IX, Sections 5-6 (pp. 140-41), Zuniga claims, in passing though, that Copernicus' theory does not contradict the Scriptures and could be accepted as one of the possible interpretations of how God structured the universe. As a part of a larger discourse of God's omnipotence and His intervention into the natural world (completely neglected in scholarly studies on Zuniga), this statement was, already after Zuniga's death, condemned for advocating the ""heliocentric heresy"". As a result of the two early seventeenth-century prohibitions of heliocentrism,Commentarywas put on theIndex of Prohibited Books. Presumably anticipating the issues his work would experience, six years after the publication ofCommentary, Zuniga published another major work of his, thePhilosophiae prima pars, in which he explicitly backed the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic worldview.","Navarro Brotons 1995;Westman 2011, pp. 311, 491.","López de Zúñiga, Diego‎(← links)","López de Zúñiga, Diego:In Iob Commentaria, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Iob_Commentaria(last revision: 20.11.2021).",,OA,Yes,OA,

This was the occasion for Caspar Barlaeus’s epigramOn the Newly-Buildt Anatomical Theatre in Amsterdam, which was printed in his poetry collection a few years later. While it is not the only poem on anatomy in the book, it is the most famous one: firstly, because it runs as an inscription around the octagonal cupola of the successor theatre, which is still extant; secondly, because it is debated in art history whether the poem alludes to the presence of Rembrandt's paintingThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulpin the theatre of 1639 (cf.Heckscher 1958, 29).The epigram, consisting of four elegiac couplets, works with pointed, paradoxical contrasts, as is typical for the genre. The first couplets reflects on how the criminals, whose bodies are dissected, did harm during their lifetime, but are useful in their deaths, and how health seeks advantages from death itself. In the second couplet, the dissected bodies teach the viewers how not to die without voice; in the third, the anatomist Tulp (1593–1674) is portrayed as giving a lecture during dissection. The last couplet is addressed to the listener of Tulp's lesson and asks him to learn about himself and to recognise God even in the smallest part of the human body.After 1690, the anatomical theatre moved back to the Waag, where it had already been before 1639 (but in a different part on the building). In this successor theatre, Barlaeus's poem decorates the octagonal cupola in golden letters on red background. Probably due to Tulp's death, the third couplet is replaced with a couplet taken from another poem in the poetry collection, titledIn mensam anatomicam(On the Dissecting Table, p. 207). This new couplet consists of an enumeration of parts of the dissected body:Frons, digitus, ren, lingua, caput, cor, pulmo, cerebrum, / ossa, manus vivo dant documenta tibi.(""Forehead, finger, kindey, tongue, head, heart, lung, brain, bones, hands give you a lesson while you live."")This inscription is subsequently quoted in vernacular descriptions of Amsterdam, like theBeschryvinge van Amsterdamof 1693, or theNieuwe atlas der stad Amsterdamof 1783 (both with Dutch translations). An interesting document of reception can also be found in Gottfried Benjamin Schael'sVergnügte Neben-Stundenof 1750, in which the author tells us not only that he saw the inscription in Amsterdam himself, but also that he once was given an invitation to a dissection which quoted two lines from Barlaeus's poem.","Heckscher 1958, 29;Schupbach 1982, 85–89","Barlaeus, Caspar‎(← links)De anatomica sectione Patavii exhibita‎(← links)Epigram on Conjoint Twins‎(← links)","Barlaeus, Caspar:In locum anatomicum recens Amstelodami exstructum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_locum_anatomicum_recens_Amstelodami_exstructum(last revision: 22.02.2022).","Also quoted in theMusei Museorum, a wunderkammer catalogue of 1714, but the order of the poem was interpreted differently, beginning with the last couplet of the printed version (inscription goes in a circle)[1]",IT,Yes,IT,

On the other hand, Manilius' five-book epic on astronomy and astrology was read not only as an interesting piece of literature, but also as a text providing valuable instruction in early modern times. Scaliger himself was genuinely interested in the science of the stars, which he would try even harder to master in the context on his later work on chronology (De emendatione temporum, 1583;Thesaurus temporum, 1606). In commenting on Manilius, it was his ambition to explain the poet to professional astronomers and astrologers who had misunderstood him so far in his opinion. His Manilius commentary illustrates how blurred and contested boundaries between scientific disciplines and other fields could be in the early modern era.Although Scaliger does not print the full text of theAstronomica, only the lemmata he comments on, his commentary fills about 300 quarto pages. It is bare of paratexts except for a short introductory section titledDe Manilio(pp. 3–4), from which one learns that nothing is known about Manilius' life, that he was no expert in his chosen subject, and that modern scholars have written nonsense about him. In the commentary itself, Scaliger tries to elucidate the astronomical and astrological content of the work. He paraphrases difficult passages, concisely explains the meaning of single expressions (theverbum … salutandimentioned in Astr. 5.65–66, for instance, is  glossed withhoc est, have, ""that is, 'ave'"", on p. 253) and inserts simple diagrams here and there. Parallels from ancient literature, in particular from the astronomical and astrological tradition, help to clarify Manilius' meaning and wording as well. The most salient trait of the commentary, however, are Scaliger's several hundred emendations, many of which have found their way into modern editions. His claim to show the experts what Manilius is about is largely based on his mending of a text that has been transmitted and printed in very bad shape so far.Scaliger clearly writes for the learned only and puts up a show of his own learning. He quotes much Greek without translating it and often comments in Greek himself. For most emendations, no reason is given. Throughout, the tone is authoritative, sometimes sarcastic. At Astr. 2.642, the manuscripts transmitin terris geniti(""born on earth""), which Scaliger wants to change toin ternis geniti(""born under three signs"", that is, under the influence of this or that trine; the problem is real but nowadays solved by transposing the verse). His commentary reads (p. 112):Sane bene, in terris. Nam profecto homines in caelo non nascuntur. Sed vapulent, qui mutarunt. Nam scripsit Manilius, in ternis.""On earth"" – excellent! For in fact men are not born in heaven. But may they be beaten up who changed the text. For Manilius wrote ""in three"".The original version of the commentary was republished with additional conjectures in 1590 without the author's blessing, which infuriated him. In 1599, Scaliger brought out a second edition himself. A third appeared posthumously in 1655, based in part on notes from Scaliger's estate.In his great Scaliger book, Anthony Grafton provides a brillant description and appraisal of the Manilius commentary, to which this entry is much indebted.","Grafton 1983–1993, vol. 1, 180–226, vol. 2, 437–459.","Scaliger, Joseph Juste‎(← links)","Scaliger, Joseph Juste:In Manilii quinque libros Astronomicon commentarius et castigationes, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Manilii_quinque_libros_Astronomicon_commentarius_et_castigationes(last revision: 12.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The poem is subdivided into three paragraphs. The first and longest one (vv. 1–26) presents the reader with a selection of the work's contents: the laws given to the Universe by God, gravitation, the structure of the solar system, the orbits of comets and the moon – in sum, everything that has been unclear and a matter of fruitless quarrel so far. In the second part (vv. 27–42), the poet rejoices at the thought that men can now leave their terrestrial worries behind and are admitted to the sky thanks to Newton, who is superior to all earlier culture heroes. In the final lines (vv. 43–48), Halley exhorts his fellow poets to join in the praise of Newton, who has come as close to the gods as a man may.Halley presents his message in a highly poetic, elevated style full of emotion and elation. Due to a high number of spondaic feet, his hexameters sound grave and solemn. Elaborated circumlocutions abound; the inventor of writing, for instance, is ""he who showed how to unite sounds painted with a reed from the Nile and to exhibit voices to the eye"" (qui Niliaca monstravit arundine pictos / consociare sonos oculisque exponere voces, vv. 35–36). Nouns are ennobled by grand epithets, such ascaeligena(""sky-created"", v. 28) for the human mind. Ubiquitous anaphoras add emphasis to the extended catalogues of the contents of thePrincipiaand of previous cultural achievements, enhancing the impression of plenty and abundance created by them. The account is enlivened by personifications: The Sun sits on his throne (Sol solio residens, v. 7), Mathematics chases away the cloud that has blocked human understanding (nubem pellente Mathesi, v. 23). While a single reader is addressed at the beginning (En tibi, v. 1), the audience is enlarged to encompass humankind as a whole later (Surgite, mortales, v. 27). Formulas borrowed fromDe rerum naturasuch asprimordia rerum(v. 2) give the poem a Lucretian flavour (although Halley steers clear of Lucretius' more conspicuous mannerisms). The comparison between Newton and earlier culture heroes and Newton's near-divinization are inspired specifically by the opening of the fifth book ofDe rerum natura.In hindsight and in view of the later tradition of extravagant praise for Newton (seeNeutonus ecloga,Epitaphium in Newtonum), one tends to quietly accept Halley's presentation of his friend as a superhuman being with direct insight into God's plan and of the publication of thePrincipiaas an epoch-making event. In 1687, however, when nobody could predict for sure how Newton's work would actually be received, Halley's claims were daring. Indeed, some of them even appeared heterodox to Richard Bentley, who oversaw the second edition of thePrincipia(1713). In the name of orthodoxy and physicotheology, Bentley rewrote vv. 2–4 (where God is bound by laws and the world eternal) and 30 (where the Decalogue is belittled) and secluded vv. 12 (comets are no longer marvelled at) and 24 (before Newton, there was nothing buterror). In the third edition (1726), however, most of the original text was restored (Albury 1978, 37–41). Be this as it may, Halley clearly made every effort to present his bold assertions of Newton's greatness in the most convincing terms possible. Today, his poem still stands out as a brillant example of the sublime style in the sense of ps.-Longinus (whose influence was on the rise in the late 17th century in the wake of Boileau's French translation) and as a masterpiece of science panegyric.",Albury 1978,"Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica‎(← links)Halley, Edmond‎(← links)Anti-Newtonianismus‎(← links)","Halley, Edmond:In Newtoni opus hocce mathematico-physicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Newtoni_opus_hocce_mathematico-physicum(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

In Gerard of Cremona's Latin translation, it became popular asLiber ad Almansoremat medieval and early modern universities, as a series of incunabula such asthis one from 1497and numerous later editions attest. Its ninth book, which discusses numerous diseases from head to toe, enjoyed particular favour. It was edited separately as early as the 1470s (seeIn Almansoris nonum collectiones) and translated afresh by the youngAndreas Vesaliusin 1537 (Haq Compier 2012). Some time towards the end of his life, the famous physician and Paduan professor Giovanni Battista da Monte lectured on the ninth book as well. After his death in 1551, Walenty z Lublina, one of his dedicated students, published the lectures on the basis of his own notes, as he also did in the case of at least eight other lectures.The book, which comprises over 700 quarto pages, is dedicated by the editor to Giovanni Poggio, a cardinal from Bologna. The letter of dedication (fols. ii r–[v] v) is followed by an extensiveindex rerumand a brief recommendation of the work to the reader by an otherwise obscure doctor of philosophy and medicine named Nicolaus Rontana (Fontana?). Following ancient custom (Mansfeld 1994), da Monte introduces his commentary by a preliminary discussion of some general topics, in this case the main issue treated in Rhazes' work, his name, his motive of writing, the medical school he belongs to, the order of his account, the order of the commentary, and a student's required attitude towards the author and the professor (fols. 1r–6v; cf.Maclean 2002, 211). Although the reader is not alerted to this fact, the commentary itself is heavily selective: only nine out of the over 90 sections of the book are discussed in as many long chapters. Rhazes' text itself is not given – students and readers are supposed to have it at hand – and it is not even referenced in the form of lemmata. There only is da Monte's running text. Indeed, the commentary's primary point of reference is not Rhazes' account but its topic, that is, the various diseases themselves. As da Monte announces in the pertinent section of his introduction (fol. 6r), he first explains the respective disease after the manner of the Empiric school, stressing practical questions of how to deal with it; after that, he goes over the same ground again, discussing more theoretical problems such as they are raised by the adherents of the Dogmatic and Methodic schools:De sexto, qualem nos simus servaturi ordinem: Nos ita procedemus: Primo caput Rasis declarabimus empirice tam circa modum operandi et curandi quam circa syndromen signorum. Completo auctoris capite iterum idem caput reassumemus dogmatice atque per methodum. Singula diligentissime declarantes, utpote de dolore capitis, an sit res praeter naturam, an secundum naturam, an morbus vel symptoma, tandem dogmatice atque ex methodo omnia perficiemus.Regarding Walenty z Lublina's role as an editor, he protests his intention to reproduce da Monte's commentariesfideliter(""exactly"") andintegerrima(""completely unscathed"") in the title and on fols. iii r–v of his letter of dedication, setting his efforts apart from editions by other (unnamed) pupils, which are sketchy, badly structured and in bad Latin. In the same breath, the editor admits that da Monte's explanations have been ""jotted down with fast hand and superficially revised"" (veloci manu collecta et perfunctorie recognita) by him, because he lacked the time to do more. The text of the commentary shows that this is no false modesty. Walenty z Lublina not only made no attempt at classicism in terms of vocabulary, he also preserved da Monte's loose and casual lecture style. Long strings of paratactic phrases,quod-constructions instead of accusative with infinitive constructions, and careless repetitions abound. Da Monte's direct addresses to the students are kept in the text. Often, the syntax is unclear. For a modern reader, the account is sometimes hard to follow. The task presumably was easier for a contemporary student who could hear the voice of a medical professor in his mind, so to speak, and was reminded of a familiar style of exposition when perusing the text.",,"Monte, Giovanni Battista da‎(← links)Lublina, Walenty z‎(← links)In nonum librum Rhasis as Mansorem expositio(redirect page) ‎(← links)In Almansoris nonum collectiones‎(← links)","Monte, Giovanni Battista da; Lublina, Walenty z:In nonum librum Rhasis ad Mansorem expositio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_nonum_librum_Rhasis_ad_Mansorem_expositio(last revision: 21.09.2021).","Da Monte on his own method of exposition (fol. 6r):De sexto, qualem nos simus servaturi ordinem: Nos ita procedemus: Primo caput Rasis declarabimus empirice tam circa modum operandi et curandi quam circa syndromen signorum.

Appended to the second edition, one finds an elegy comprising 102 lines and titledSad Poem of Praise on Occasion of the Demise of Pierre Gassendi. The text starts from an outburst of grief addressed to the Muses and to Urania in particular, since Gassendi died because of overexertion in his astronomical studies (1–25). The speaker then consoles himself with the thought that Gassendi now enjoys perfect happiness in heaven (25–34). Next, a long section is devoted to the deceased's social virtues: his modesty, love of peace, which let him quietly tolerate vilification by others, and admiration of great men, which resulted in biographies his fellow astronomers Peiresc,Brahe(seeTychonis Brahei vita),Peuerbauch,CopernicusandRegiomontanus(36–70). Finally, Quillet turns to some of Gassendi's personal friends: Henri Louis Habert de Montmor, in whose house Gassendi died, is supposed to publish his posthumous papers, the poet Jean Chapelain should compose poems on him, while the author himself still wavers between mourning and rejoicing (71–102).The style is emotional and elevated. Quillet makes frequent use of a number of emotive rhetorical figures such as exclamation, apostrophe andgeminatio. Gassendi's name, for instance, is repeated three times right at the beginning (5–7), perhaps in imitation of the Roman custom ofconclamatio. As a telling example of the author's striving for an exquisite style, one may adduce the neologismaltum-sapiens(""highly-wise"", 12), which strictly speaking breaks the rules of Latin word composition and appears to be a calque of Greek ἀκρόσοφος.Conceptually, it is noteworthy that the multi-faceted scientific achievements of Gassendi, who also was greatly interested in topics such as atomism, kinematics, magnetism and chemistry, are reduced to astronomy and subordinated to his social virtues. For most of the time, the poem therefore presents Gassendi in the company of his fellow-astronomers (whose lives he described) and friends (who should take care of his intellectual legacy). Another conspicuous trait, which is perhaps connected to the focus on astronomy, is Quillet's use of a pertinent topos which can also be found in other poems such as theEpigramma Ptolemaeo adscriptum: Astronomy's interest in things high above implies that it is a spiritually uplifting activity as well. In the present elegy, this thought is given a Christian twist. The astronomical and the Christian heaven seem to coincide, and death appears as the fulfilment of Gassendi's perennial wish to leave the earth and visit heaven in person (31–32):Quas superum aeternas sedes, quae lucida longoGassendus studio quaesiit, astra tenet.The eternal seats of those above, the luminous starsGassendi tried to reach in long-standing effort, now he holds them.",,"Quillet, Claude‎(← links)","Quillet, Claude:In obitu Petri Gassendi lugubre encomium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_obitu_Petri_Gassendi_lugubre_encomium(last revision: 29.07.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Constantijn'sepigramon Descartes' portrait). A handful of Huygen's Latin epigrams on Descartes appear in the second edition of theMonumenta desultatoria, a collection of Huygen’s Latin poetry: one on Descartes’Principia philosophiae(p. 202), one on the famous Cartesian axiomCogito, ergo sum(p. 331–2), two epigrams on Descartes’ image and his name respectively (p. 371) and two on Descartes’ death on February, 11th, 1650 (p. 378–9). A modern edition of Huygens’ poetry from the manuscripts (Worp 1894, vol. 4, 232–8) shows that Huygens had written even more poems on Descartes’ death both in French and Latin (the Latin one is the triumphant epitaphCartesius iacet hic, iacet aeternumque iacebit / victima Cartesio victus Aristoteles, “Here lies Descartes, and lies, and will forever lie as a victim, Aristotle, defeated by Descartes”, which seems, however, to have remained in manuscript).While the second of the two printed epigram forms a religious climax of things that Descartes has seen, the inner workings of nature and Christina of Sweden, which leaves him only to see the heaven and Christ (post Christinam Christus) as the culminating point, the first epigram is based on a very different idea, namely the circular nature of life. Five of the eight elegiac couplets (l. 1–10) are dedicated to the observations of circularities in nature: the sun sets and rises again, the moon waxes and wanes, the morning star becomes the evening star, the tides come and go, new trees grow out of seeds, in myth, the phoenix rises from the ashes, leading to the conclusion that nature is a circle (l. 11–2). However, the poet exclaims, this rule falls only short when it comes to Descartes: everything that has died will be born again, but René will never be given back reborn:Cuncta renascentur, quae nunc cecidere – Renatum / nulla renascentem saecula restituent(l. 15–6). In these final lines, the poet poignantly plays with Descartes’ first name René/Renatus: Although his name literally means “reborn”, there will never be a second René Descartes.In manuscript, the poem is dated as of March, 15th, 1650, roughly a month after Descartes’ death. Huygens also composed a French paraphrase of this very epigram, dated as of March, 17th (cf. Worp 1894, vol. 4, 233).","Worp 1892–99(edition of Huygen's poetry),Blom 1997(on Huygens as a neo-Latin poet)","Huygens, Constantijn‎(← links)","Huygens, Constantijn:In obitum Renati Cartesii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_obitum_Renati_Cartesii(last revision: 25.01.2022).",,IT,Yes,IT,

This poem stands out because of its length and metre: consisting of 54 iambic dimetres, it occupies an entire folio page in a small column. The epigram was composed by Gérard Morrhy, the printer of theProtomathesis. However, this fact is not reflected in the poem.The panegyric poem addresses the reader, commending Oronce's work. Building on the metaphor of seed and harvest for the production of a learned book, the epigram starts:Segetes tibi pulcherrimas / collegit ille ORONTIUS(„The famous ORONCE collected the most beautiful seeds for you“, l. 1–2). These seeds, the poet explains, stem from Sophia’s temple and the gardens of the Muses (l. 16–9). Oronce worked hard to restore mathematics to its former splendor, going through the corrupted works of ancient writers (l. 19–36) like a bee that collects honey from many flowers (l. 37–41). The epigram then returns to the agricultural metaphor that opened the poem, inviting the reader to ""sagaciously collect the blessed harvest"" of Oronce’s work (... sagaciter tibi / messem beatam collige, l. 51–2).The praise of Oronce is both vivid and conventional. For example, the origin of the seeds collected by Oronce is expressed as such:non Africae aut Iberiaecampis, nec Hesperidum aureishortis, at intimo penuSophiae et viretis Thespiadummedia vel ipsa floridisbruma ...""Not from the fields of Africa or Spain, nor from the golden gardens of the Hesperids, but from the innermost part of the temple of Sophia and the greenswards of the Muses that blossom even in the middle of winter…""Similarily, the time-honoured comparison between author and bee is expressed in a vignette of five verses. The portrayal of Oronce as a dedicated author working at night is another topos that is vividly elaborated (l. 20–3). In the poem, Oronce's work amounts to the resurrection of the dead and ruined mathematics (l. 23–6, 45–8).",,"Protomathesis‎(← links)Morrhy, Gérard‎(← links)","Morrhy, Gérard:In operis commendationem epigramma, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_operis_commendationem_epigramma(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,,Yes,IT,
"Kepler, Johannes,Camerarius, Joachim",In opus revolutionum Nicolai Copernici Torunnaei dialogus inter hospitem et doctum quempiam,"Nicolaus Copernicus, De revolutionibus orbium caelestium, Nuremberg 1543",1598,,,16th century,"Dialogue, Translation, Panegyric poem",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,In opus revolutionum(UB Leipzig),not available,"This intriguing manuscript poem was written by Johannes Kepler in his copy ofCopernicus’De revolutionibus orbium coelestiumon the flyleaf. Dated as of 22nd December 1598, Kepler’s poem is more than 50 years younger than the printed book into which it is inserted. As the subscriptionI. K. vertitindicates, the poem is, in fact, a translation. The original is a Greek manuscript poem byJoachim Camerarius, which had been copied into at least two copies of Copernicus’ revolutionary book, extant in Parma and Vicenza. Kepler's poem contains a few corrections by the author himself, mostly of a stylistic nature (e.g. v. 28:deditinstead ofrefert).The panegyric poem is written in the standard metre of elegiac couplets, but chooses the unusal form of a dialogue to advertise Copernicus' book and to address the radical idea of heliocentrism it put forward. The dialogue takes place between the curioushospes/ξένος (""guest"" or ""host""), who has not yet read the book, and thedoctus/φιλόσοφος (""learned man""), who has already studied it. One has to imagine that the learned man has brought a copy of Copernicus with him, which prompts his friend to ask questions about the book (v. 1–2):H.Quid libri video?D.Novus est.H.Et quae nova profert?D.Plurima.H.An et bona sunt?D.Optima cuncta puto.H.“What book is this?”D.“A new one.”H.“And what new things does it put forward?”D.”Very many.”H.”And are they good, too?”D.“All of them are very good, in my opinion.”Next, thehospesseems to flick through the book and notices a lot of geometric figures and numbers, to which thedoctusresponds that geometry is necessary to understand the treasures of wisdom encompassed in the book (v. 3–7a; here, the poem references the motto of Plato's Academy, which is also printed in Greek on the title page ofDe revolutionibus orbium coelestium). After this rather general introduction, thehospesdirects the conversation to the crucial topic of heliocentrism (v. 7b–18; notably, thehospesis well aware that this is the subject of the book that they are talking about). When thehospeshas expressed his incredulity in a series of questions and exclamations, thedoctusreacts by admonishing him to study Copernicus's book in depth: in his short speech at the end of the poem (l. 19–32), he also recommends the study of Euclid, Archimedes and Ptolemy (rendered learnedly asMegarensis,Syracusius senex, andPelusiacus) as a basis. The speech ends with two standard topoi: to challenge the reader to produce something better if he does not agree with the book, and to promise that the author will be famous among the learned men.Kepler's copy of Copernicus'De revolutionibus, which is now held by the University Library of Leipzig, is a telling example of how an early modern scientiest could engage with a scientific text: not only did Kepler annotate the text on the margins, but he also added a poetic paratext that promoted Copernicus' book and the heliocentric world it proposed. In addition, the example also highlights how a manuscript poem praising a new scientific idea like Camerarius' poem circulated in addition to and in combination with printed texts and generated and influenced new pieces of promotion of science in turn.","Müller 1965(facsimile of Kepler's copy);Gingerich 2002, 355–61 (including Greek text with facsimile, Latin and English translation);Seck; Balzert 2018(edition, translation, and commentary)","Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)Camerarius, Joachim‎(← links)Müller 1965‎(← links)Gingerich 2002‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes; Camerarius, Joachim:In opus revolutionum Nicolai Copernici Torunnaei dialogus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_opus_revolutionum_Nicolai_Copernici_Torunnaei_dialogus(last revision: 07.11.2021).",,"JL, IT",,IT,"Universitätsbibliothek Leipzig, Libri.sep.577-r"

Ar–A2r",1559,Wittenberg,Georg Rhau Erben,16th century,Other (see description),"Mathematics, Physics",In praelectionem optices(Google Books),928702,"For the better part, the internal communication of early modern universities is lost for good. Even most of what was printed in the form of broadsheets and booklets has probably vanished. An exception to this rule is provided by a series of volumes published, apparently to promotional ends, from the 1540s to the 1570s by the University of Wittenberg. TitledScriptorum publice propositorum a professoribus / rectoribus / gubernatoribus in Academia Wittebergensior the like, these tomes contain a mixture of political news,  releases by the rector, occasional and other poetry, and lecture announcements. The third volume comprises theintimationes(as this material was collectively called) of the years 1556–1559. In his dedication to Adolf of Nassau, who had studied at Wittenberg, the editor Michael Maius complains about unnamed detractors of the university and announces that theintimationeswill show the true greatness of the institution. The volume was reprinted in1568 and 1570, so it must have found an interested readership.The lecture announcements contained in this volume are not as dry and factual as their modern counterparts. In them, professors try to advertise what they have to offer as best they can and to attract as many students as possible. This is well exemplified by the present announcement of an optics course from 1556 by the young Sorbian doctor, mathematician, polymath and son-in-law of Melanchthon, Caspar Peucer. This text of two and a half octavo pages starts from a theologically informed praise of light: at the beginning of times, God divided light and darkness; He is said to be pure light Himself. After that, Peucer briefly goes through the main subjects of optics – vision, reflection, refraction, colours, mirrors, lenses, sense deceptions, optics in astronomy – and announces that he will discuss all of them. He expects students to eagerly flock to his lessons.Peucer's text is rhetorically efficient. His chosen topic is extolled by means of its theological associations, its internal richness and its usefulness (utilitas). The aspects to be lectured upon are presented so succinctly that students presumably understood just enough to make them curious for more. The style is catchy and emotional. Greek technical terms like ἀνάκλασις or διαφανής demonstrate the professor's learning and familiarity with the classical authorities. Rhetorical questions, superlative expressions and lofty comparisons abound. Right at the beginning, for instance, a suggestive analogy is drawn between the macrocosm, the universe, and the microcosm, the human body:Distinctio lucis et tenebrarum condita est, ut lucis utilitas conspectior esset, quae et sese et res ceteras ostendit et discernit. Et conditi sunt oculi, qui et ipsi sunt lucis domicilia et veluti similitudo caelestium corporum aut stellarum. Haec et in caelo et in hominis aedificio valde admiranda esse fatendum est.""The difference between light and darkness has been created to make the usefulness of light more visible: it shows and distinguishes itself and all other things. The eyes have been created as well, which are homesteads of light themselves and, as it were, a likeness of the heavenly bodies or stars. One has to admit that this is very marvellous in the sky as well as in the building of the human body.""As interesting as Peucer's announcement is as a testimony to mid-16th century academic teaching at Wittenberg, it passes over in silence a number of aspects about which one would like to be informed as well. Part of the  omissions may be strategical. Are the lectures public or private? The expressionhis proximis diebus(""during the next days"") rather points to a short series of sessions organized ad hoc than to a regular lecture course extending over a whole semester, but Peucer does not elaborate on this point. Where and when are the lectures supposed to take place? Are participants charged a fee? This appears probable, but an advertisement presumably is not the place to talk about such lowly matters. Does Peucer intend to read from his own manuscript, comment on some ancient or medieval classic or use a modern printed manual? In the latter cases, he may not want to point his potential listeners to such material as they can use autodidactically as well.",,"Peucer, Caspar‎(← links)","Peucer, Caspar:In praelectionem optices, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_praelectionem_optices(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Cum privilegio.",,1575,Venice,Meietti,16th century,Commentary,Medicine,In primam fen primi libri Canonis Avicennae expositio(Google Books),831510,"Avicenna's massive medical encyclopaedia, theCanon, was a standard teaching text at late medieval and early modern medical faculties (Siraisi 1987). As often with classical texts, much attention was focussed on its beginning. The first fen (section) of the first book in particular was regularly made the subject of lectures, which could be published in the form of commentaries. Such commentaries were written, for instance, by Ugo Benzi (Venice 1518) andSantorio Santorio(Venice 1625). Around the mid-16th century, the Paduan professor Oddo degli Oddi gave another one-year lecture course on this opening part of theCanon. 17 years after his death, his son Marco Oddi completed his manuscript and published it as a substantial volume comprising some 500 quarto pages. He dedicated the book to Pio Enea I Obizzi, condottiere in the service of the Serenissima, in a letter in which he recounted how Asclepius had appeared to him in a dream together with his deceased father and ordered him to do so. The dedication is preceded by an overview of the subsections of the first fen and followed by a list of errata. At the end of the volume, one finds a copious index.In an introductory passage (pp. 1–3), Oddi alludes to the original setting of his commentary. He promises to find the right balance between exaggerated concision and garrulity and excuses himself for paying more attention to content than elegant style (cf. below). The commentary itself presents itself as a sequence of lemmata from Avicenna's text printed in italics, which are followed by Oddi's much longer explanations. The extracts from theCanonare given in two Latin translations, which presumably were the most popular with students at the time (seeHasse 2016, 98–115, 361–62): Andrea Alpago's corrected version of Gerard of Cremona's medieval translation, officially adopted in Padua in 1521, and Jacob Mantino ben Samuel's translation of the first fen from a previous Hebrew version (c. 1540 and 1547). While Alpago's version is very strange Latin and often difficult to understand, Mantino's makes better sense, at least to the modern reader.Oddi's explanations first of all try to clarify the basic meaning of theCanon. He paraphrases Avicenna's words and explains his train of thougth. Often, the commentary explicates the connection between two lemmata, providing a kind of bridge between them. Occasionally, Oddi goes to considerable lenghts in order to elucidate Avicenna's reasoning by reducing it to syllogistic form (e.g. pp. 174–75). He may even present a complex theory as a Ramist chart (p. 127). Beyond that, Avicenna is placed in the context of the medical tradition at large, the opinions of whose exponents such as Galen, Hippocrates, or Aristotle may be discussed (e.g. pp. 399–400). In such cases, the respective works and passages are indicated in the margins. Oddi may also oppose the explanations of earlier commentators (p. 125).Oddi's Latin is free from humanist aspirations. His is a typical lecture style. Clarity and intellegibility are paramount, elegance is unimportant. Oddi makes free use of didactic formulae. For instance, the wordsdices — respondendum igitur censeo(""you will say — I thus take the view that it must be answered"") or variants thereof are often used to discuss possible objections. Instead of anaccusativus cum infinitivo, aquodconstraction is regularly applied. Abstract nouns of all kinds are adhibited and perhaps even formed ad hoc, as in the following example, in which the abstract is readily explained:Dubium hic est de medicinarum actuatione, nimirum quomodo medicinae a calore nostro ad actum deductae in nos agant(""Here, there is a doubt about the actuation of drugs, that is, how drugs brought to action by our warmth may act upon us"", p. 155).Despite its late publication, Oddi's commentary seems to have been popular.

Over centuries, the work was considered an original work written by Ptolemy. In the Middle Ages, it became an astrological ‘best-seller’: in the twelfth century only, it was translated at least six times, mainly in the Toledo and Sicily regions, with the two most influential translations having been produced by John of Seville and Plato of Tivoli. There are more than one hundred and fifty manuscripts of theCentiloquiumextant.In the Renaissance, the influence of theCentiloquiumremained strong, although some Renaissance scholars doubted its authenticity. Thus, in the sixteenth century,Girolamo Cardanoput forward the problem of theCentiloquium’s authorship indicating several discrepancies between it and Ptolemy’s other writings. Despite Cardano’s conclusion, the question of authorship remained in play until the end of the nineteenth century when the German scholar Franz Boll finally proved that the traditional authorship was wrong. As recent studies have shown, the real author was an Arab scholar Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri.
In the fifteenth century, new translations of theCentiloquiumwere produced. One of them belonged to a Greek scholar George of Trebizond, who was then at the court of the Aragonese kings in Naples. While he started to translate the text in 1454, George of Trebizond prepared three versions of the translation, with the last one dating to the second half of 1456. The translation was supplemented with a special commentary on theCentiloquiumand two astrological opuscula – theDe antisciisand theCur his temporibus astrologorum iudicia fallant– all dedicated to his patron Alfonso of Aragon and present in subsequent editions of George's translation of theCentiloquium.
In the dedication, George claims that astrology should be considered as a part of natural philosophy and its main aim is to help philosophy in exploring the world. George suggests discoveringnatura secreta(‘secret nature’) with the use of Ptolemy and ‘his teacher’ Aristotle, whose philosophical positions he draws together in the Commentary. George claims that it is extremely hard to explain the complexity of celestial operations, which formed the universe. To clarify his calculations, Ptolemy, according to George, wrote a special compendium entitled the Liber Fructus. Thus, he considers theCentiloquiumto be an astronomical and mathematical supplement to both theAlmagestand theTetrabiblos.
In theCentiloquium, George firmly rejects all astronomical novelties introduced, in his opinion, by Islamic astrologers, who misinterpreted and misunderstood Ptolemy. Thus, George's idea to translate Ptolemy may be explained as an attempt to confront the Greek astronomical tradition with the Arabic. The whole purpose in translating Ptolemy’s texts was devoted to the explanation of the 'real', that is, Greek, astronomy, transferred to the Latin world without major changes.",Lemay 1978;Monfasani 1976;Monfasani 1984;Rinaldi 1999,Ps.-Ptolemy‎(← links)Georgius Trapezuntius‎(← links)Commentarii in centum Claudii Ptolemaei sententias‎(← links)Apotelesmata astrologiae Christianae‎(← links),"Ps.-Ptolemy; Georgius Trapezuntius:In Ptolemaei centum aphorismos commentarius, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Ptolemaei_centum_aphorismos_commentarius(last revision: 03.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,OA,

Widely recognised as a practising astrologer composing numerous horoscopes and almanacks, at the same time, in part to increase his reputation, Cardano was involved in the heated contemporary debates on the status of astrology, in general, and the authority of theprinceps astrologorum, that is, Ptolemy. Starting from the fifteenth century, Ptolemy's calculations and interpretations of the universe had been questioned by astronomers (such as Peuerbach and Regiomontanus); on the other hand, in the field of astrology, several scholars sought to re-interpret Ptolemy's astrological system in the light of new findings. Unlike Pico della Mirandola, who firmly criticised Ptolemy and his followers for augmenting inconsistencies within the astrological tradition, Cardano clearly followed the trend supported by George of Trebizond and Giovanni Pontano, whose commentaries on (Pseudo-)Ptolemy'sCentiloquiumare of particular importance in this respect.The aim, to ""revive"" Ptolemy's legacy and provide a reliable interpretation of many obscure passages in his astrological opus magnum, theTetrabiblos, explains the foundational character of Cardano's commentary. The main body of the text has the following structure: a passage taken from theTetrabiblosand Cardano's notes on the passage. This way of structuring the argument allows to Cardano to go through the whole treatise and, as he believed, advocate astrology. Despite the idea to ""reform"" the grounds for astrological speculation, both Cardano's language and his array of sources are traditional. Thus, to prove the validity of astrology in medical matters, he relies on Hippocrates and Galen, both relatively known by the time. However, in some respect, Cardano's commentary seems to be progressive since it for the first time cast doubts in the authenticity of Ptolemy'sCentiloquium. By analysing several astrological practices introduced in the Islamic world, but yet described in theCentiloquium, Cardano concluded that the text could not have been written by Ptolemy. Nevertheless, Ptolemy's authorship of theCentiloquiumwas dismissed only in the nineteenth century.Cardano's commentary was reasonably successful, as proved by a second and a third edition.","Grafton 1999, 251–289Pompeo Faracovi 2012Akopyan 2018","Cardano, Girolamo‎(← links)","Cardano, Girolamo:In Ptolemaei de astrorum iudiciis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Ptolemaei_de_astrorum_iudiciis(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,OA,

However, this title refers in fact to another work bound into the same volume (cf.Chroboczek 2013).The edition of letters covered only 6 quarto pages. Brożek used the opportunity to have three epigrams on Copernicus printed on the two remaining pages of the sheet, which would have been left blank otherwise. The two epigrams on the first page praise Ptolemy and Copernicus (In Ptolemaeum et Copernicum duo naturae miraculaandAliud eiusdem argumenti), the third is titledCopernicus de se ipsoand provides a summary of his life which is obviously modelled on the famous epitaph of Vergil (Me genuit Torunna, Cracovia me arte polivit, / inter habet primos Varmia clara patres.""Torun gave birth to me, Cracow polished me in the arts, Warmia has me among the most eminent fathers"").Brożek's two epigrams on Ptolemy and Copernicus, the ""two miracles of nature"", are very similar to each other. Both are addresses to the river Nile in elegiac couplets and are built on the same premise: Like the Nile prides himself on Ptolemy'sAlmagest, so the Vistula can pride herself upon Copernicus's discovery that the earth is moving. The claim that Copernicus is equal in standing to Ptolemy is thus presented in terms of a competition between the Egyptian and the Polish river (poem 1, v. 5–6):Laude Copernici, qui Vistulae ad ostia terram / movit, adaequat se Vistula, Nile, tibi.(""Through the fame of Copernicus, who moved the earth at the mouth of Vistula, Vistula makes herself equal to you, o Nile.""). Copernicus's equality to Ptolemy is then spelled out in the closing lines of the second poem (v. 9–10): If the Nile hesitates to admit that Vistula is equal in fame because she does not have Ptolemy, he will see upon close inspection that Copernicus will perhaps be a Ptolemy, too:Quod si te nomen Ptolemaei detinet: istum / si bene pervideas, fors Ptolemaeus erit.In the end, Brożek never wrote his biography of Copernicus. However, Marcin Radymińksi's biography of Copernicus, which was realised in Cracow in the mid-17th century, but remained in manuscript, includes his epigrams: the three epigrams discussed here as well as further epigramscomparing Copernicus to Columbusorcelebrating Copernicus's observatory(cf.Kühne; Kirschner 2004, 164–5).","Bitzel 1997, 207–8,Kühne; Kirschner 2004,Chroboczek 2013","Brożek, Jan‎(← links)In duos συγχρόνους cosmographiae ocellos‎(← links)In turrim, quam Copernicus incolatu suo et opere revolutionum ibi confecto illustrem reddidit‎(← links)","Brożek, Jan:In Ptolemaeum et Copernicum duo naturae miracula, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Ptolemaeum_et_Copernicum_duo_naturae_miracula(last revision: 26.02.2021).","I'm not sure whether Chroboczek's argument that this is a separate leaflet really holds up – the folio numbers of the volume seem to be perfectly consistent (the ""Three Kraków Letters"" are on sheet D (quarto), following another text of sheet C (quarto).

The key argument in Kinner's evaluation of Hevelius' and Columbus' achievements seems to be usefulness (quodque rei caput est, inventis fructus utrisque / centuplus, v. 29–30).

Clavius provided an encyclopedic commentary with additional explanatory material, especially, but not exclusively for students and succeded in producing one of the most influential astronomical textbooks of the time: His commentary was reissued 18 times until 1618 (Valleriani 2017, 469–470) and read by many students of the Collegio Romano as well as of other Jesuit schools and natural philosophers outside the order.Galileo Galileiwas only one of its most famous readers.Clavius's main goal seems to have been to provide a greater amount of mathematical demonstration for the Ptolemaic world system and to defend it against various rising criticism. Copernicus's model, however, he accused to contradict common sense and passages from Scripture. In the course of the reissue of new editions of Clavius's commentary (seven, altogether), he reworked some aspects of it, including a more and more favourable position towards some Copernicus, especially his mathematical and astronomical skills: He included the astronomical results on the Earth's precession movement but rejected the physical explaination by Copernicus involving another movement of Earth. Instead, he gave his own reasons consistent with the Ptolemaic cosmology.
Also, Clavius did not keep his eyes closed to new observations: The novas of 1572, 1600 and 1604 were located in the sphere of fixed stars and thus contradicted Aristotle's claim of an unchanging celestial realm. In the last version even Galileo's discoveries are included: The phases of Venus and Jupiter are correctly identified to by of great significance for the development of astronomy.The first edition of his commentary was dedicated to Pope Pius V. Clavius's introduction provided information on the character, use and history of astronomy until his time. This was followed by Sacrobosco's text and an extensive commentary at the page bottom, including mathematical descriptions and explanations as well as numerous illustrations. Clavius does not only cite from other natural philosophical works, also ancient poetry is included in his list of authorial texts and cited, e.g. Claudian, Manilius's influential didactic poemAstronomicaor Lucan's historical eposBellum civile. Included are i.a. numerous illustrations, extensive tables with the coordinates of stellar constellations as well as coordinates for many cities.Clavius's work is an excellent example of a changing astronomical environment in the late 16th and early 17th century even among Ptolemaicists: New findings of Galileo and superior calculations by Copernicus could no longer be ignored and were acknowledged; on the other hand, geocentrism is fiercely defended. Abandoning aristotelism however, seemed to be much easier.","Thorndike 1949, 42;Valleriani 2017;Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 20, 148–150",Sphaera in usum scholarum‎(← links),"Clavius, Christoph:In Sphaeram Ioannis de Sacrobosco commentarius, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_Sphaeram_Ioannis_de_Sacrobosco_commentarius(last revision: 09.01.2023).",,MK,Yes,"JL, FB",

As a side product of this endeavour, Brożek wrote several epigrams in praise of Copernicus. He appendedsome of themto the three letters on Copernicus that he edited. Others - theepigrams on Copernicus and Columbusand the epigram on Copernicus's observation tower - were printed on single sheets.The epigramOn the Tower Which Copernicus Made Famous Because He Dwelled There and Finished His Work on the Revolutions Thereis 12 verses long and written in elegiac couplets. It opens with a priamel: colossal statues, marmor busts and pyramids shall glorify others - Copernicus's great mind lifts this tower up high (v. 1-6). From this tower, he saw the secret revolutions  of the planets and the earth and discovered that the sun stands still and the stars are fixed (v. 7-8). The gods admire him from above for his discoveries: his tower shall be counted among the wonders of the world (v. 9-12).After the last verse of the poem, there is a biblical motto in Latin and in Greek (καί γε σὺν τὸν αἰῶνα ἔδωκεν ἐν καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν/et mundum tradidit disputationi eorum,Ecclesiastes3.11). The motto is followed by the same astronomical date as in theColumbus epigrams, suggesting that the two sheets were printed together.In the end, Brożek never wrote his biography of Copernicus. However, his epigrams are featured in Marcin Radymińksi's biography of Copernicus, which was realised in Cracow in the mid-17th century, but remained in manuscript (cf.Kühne; Kirschner 2004, 164–5).",,"In Ptolemaeum et Copernicum duo naturae miracula‎(← links)Brożek, Jan‎(← links)In duos συγχρόνους cosmographiae ocellos‎(← links)","Brożek, Jan:In turrim, quam Copernicus incolatu suo et opere revolutionum ibi confecto illustrem reddidit, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/In_turrim,_quam_Copernicus_incolatu_suo_et_opere_revolutionum_ibi_confecto_illustrem_reddidit(last revision: 26.02.2021).",,IT,Yes,IT,"Jagiellonian Library, BJ St. Dr. 14100 III a"

As intimated already by its title (Inarime and Pithecusae being two ancient names of Ischia), the text uses the hot springs of Ischia as a focal point and principle of organisation. Book 1 contains a description of the island in general as well as of its baths. Book 2 narrates the origins and the history of medical baths and describes their various types. Book 3 considers the causes of the four qualities by which the waters of Ischia are distinguished: temperature, colour, smell and taste. Book 4 explains their medical virtues, book 5 prescribes how they should be used. The last book shows how to deal with harmful side effects and to remain healthy after recovery.The author makes good use of the classical devices of didactic epic such as, for example, invocations of Muses, catalogues and addresses to the reader. He writes in a lush, baroque style, making ample use of history, mythology and digressions of all kind. His most important model by far is Virgil's Georgics, from which not only many phrases and turns of thought, but also whole set pieces are imitated (cf., e.g., the sphragis at the end of the work.)The publication features many paratexts: The poem is preceded by a letter to the dedicatee, a panegyric poem to the same, a letter to the benevolent reader (mainly concerned with questions of style and arrangement), a synopsis of the work, and the imprimatur of the authorities; it is followed by seven indices (general, balneological, nosological, of places, of metamorphoses, of descriptions, and of authors); and, last not least, it is accompanied by an ample auto-commentary at the foot of each page. Moreover, the work as a whole and each book opens with a copper engraving.

"Brasavola, Antonio Musa","Antonii Musae Brasavoli, medici Ferrariensis, Index refertissimus in omnes Galeni libros, qui ex Iunctarum sexta editione extant, in quam indicem eorum operum inclusimus, quae postremo ad nos pervenere.",,1586,Venice,Giunti,16th century,"Dictionary/Lexicon, Other (see description), Encyclopedic work",Medicine,Index refertissimus in omnes Galeni libros(Google Books),833195,"In 1541, the Venetian branch of the printer dynasty of the Giunti brought out their first edition of the complete works of Galen in Latin. Until 1625, nine suchopera omniaeditions were produced. When the second edition came out in 1550, the Giunti requested the renowned doctor, botanist and university professor Antonio Musa Brasavola to add a full index to it. Starting from an index he already had compiled for his personal use, Brasavola produced the presentMost Crammed Index to All Books by Galen. In his task, he was helped by his young colleague Iacobus Antonius Bonus, as he explains in the dedication of the work to Ercole d'Este IV., in which the story of the whole enterprise is briefly told. When the index finally came out in 1556, preceded, in addition to the dedication, by a letter to those interested in medicine (medicinae studiosis) by Bonus, Brasavola had already died. For the sixth edition (1586), the index was expanded to encompass a number of additional Galenic works which had been included in the Giuntina in the meantime. Subsequently, it was reprinted unchanged except for the number of the edition on its title page. (Of the 1625 edition, a modern reprint was produced by Olms in 1975.)The index easily ranks among the most complete and extensive registers ever compiled for a single author. In its definitive version, it fills nearly 2200 columns on 1100 folio pages and contains a little under 150,000 alphabetically ordered entries. At least as noteworthy as these astonishing figures in themselves is the care devoted to each single entry. For a given word likefauces(""throat""), for instance, the passages in which Galen has something to say about the topic are not lumped together under one heading, but each passage (or a very small number of passages) gets a separate entry, which results in several dozenfaucesentries. In each of them, Galen's respective statement is first summarized, then the Galenic work(s), book(s), and chapter(s) as well as the corresponding volume(s), page(s) and section(s) in the Giuntina are given. A typical entry reads as follows (fol. 183v, left column):faucium venis strictiores sunt venae gutturis. de vict(us) rat(ione) in morb(is) acu(tis) com(mentariorum) 4o. 7a.138F.""Compared to the veins of the throat, the veins of the gorge are more tense. In book 4 of theCommentaries[on Hippocrates' work]On the Manner of Life in Acute Diseases. Vol. 7, p. 138F.""Brasavola'sIndex refertissimusno doubt greatly enhanced the usability of the Giuntina and helped to ensure its popularity and longevity. Beyond that, it was much more than an ordinary index strictly subservient to the text itemized by it, but amounted to an alphabetically ordered epitome of theCorpus Galenicumand to a kind of medical encyclopaedia in its own right. Bonus clearly was aware of this when he sketched the various uses to which the work could be put in his letter to themedicinae studiosis(last page):Nam sive vobis aegri curandi sint sive cum aliis de eorum vita ac morte disceptandum, sive publice rem medicam profiteamini seu de medica materia aliquid conscribere in animo habeatis, ita copiose, ita distincte, ita suo singula vobis ordine sese offerent, ut nihil praeterea requirendum.""For whether you have to cure patients or to discuss topics decisive for their life or death with others, whether you are teaching medicine in public or planning to write something about medical substances, the single subjects will present themselves to you in such abundance, so clearly distinguished from one another, so well-ordered, that you will not have to ask for anything more.""",,"Brasavola, Antonio Musa‎(← links)","Brasavola, Antonio Musa:Index refertissimus in omnes Galeni libros, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Index_refertissimus_in_omnes_Galeni_libros(last revision: 16.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Moreover, one rarely finds a bibliographer's purpose and planning set out as precisely and in so much detail as in the present case.The unpaginatedPraefatiodescribes the situation to which theBeginningsrespond: The mass of literature available in all fields of human knowledge has become a hindrance rather than a help because of the difficulty to find what one looks for. In this way, the progress of human knowledge is greatly hampered. Bibliographies usually fall into one of two categories, namelyliteraturam nominalem et realem(third page), which basically means alphabetical and thematic ones. The former are nice to have (pulchrum), but the latter, which lead to the things themselves, are essential. In medicine, many attempts at a good thematic bibliography have been made, 13 of which are enumerated, but all of them have resulted in patchwork only (fere non sunt nisi fragmenta, next-to-last page). That is why Ploucquet has decided to give it a new try.TheIntroductio(pp. I–XII), which is divided into several sections, informs about the genesis and character of the work. The idea goes back to Ploucquet's student years (Occasio et genesis operis, p. I). UnderFontes operis(pp. II–V), it is explained, among other things, that no quality criterium has been applied. Dubious and unimportant works have been admitted alongside good ones, Ploucquet's doubts being sometimes indicated by a question mark. By contrast, pharmaceutical and balneological works have been omitted. The works quoted are never corrected and supplemented, but their contents as well as reviews in journals are sometimes indicated. Next, it is described in detail how Ploucquet has collected his material and composed his bibliography, including artisanal details concerning the use of scissors and glue (Modus colligendi, pp. V–VII). The section titledLeges ordinationis(pp. VII–IX) explains that a thematic rather than a chronological order has been chosen. UnderSynthesis operis(pp. IX–XI), one learns that two classes of works have been set apart and prefixed to the rest: encyclopaedic works, whose consultation is silently presupposed hereafter, and less general, but nonetheless important works cited with the author's name and page number only. The body of the work is ordered thematically. Not only the major keywords but also their subdivisions follow each other in alphabetical order. The material regarding specific diseases, which account for the major part of the headings, is arranged according to a specific plan (see below). The next-to-last section,Operis perfectio(p. XI), explicitly states that despite its c. 130,000 entries, the work is incomplete and that it never can be completed:Ipsa operis natura ita comparata est, ut numquam absolvi possit.Supplements are planned to follow every other or every third year. The work may know a completely new edition after some 25 years and hopefully will be continued after Ploucquet's death. It is useful for medical practitioners, authors, and reviewers (Usus, pp. XI–XII).As announced in the introduction, the main part is mostly ordered by diseases and their subspecies. Under each heading, works on a number of aspects are given in more or less (but not completely) standardized order. The most important of these are the disease in general, its aetiology (causae), and therapy (therapia). The respective subsections can be subdivided further by keywords. At the bottom of the structural hierarchy, one finds the various titles, ordered alphabetically by the last name of author.In accordance with Ploucquet's plans, four tomes titledContinuatio et supplementaappeared in the years 1799–1803. Their contents were united with the original work, freshly layouted and published in four volumes under the new titleLiteratura medica digesta sive repertorium medicinae practicae, chirurgiae atque rei obstetriciaein 1808–1809. Another supplement to this new version (in whose preface the whole publication history is concisely explained) was published in 1814, the year of Ploucquet's death. His hope that his work would be continued by someone else thereafter remained unfulfilled.","Besterman 1955–1956, vol. 2, cols. 2498–99","Ploucquet, Wilhelm Gottfried‎(← links)","Ploucquet, Wilhelm Gottfried:Initia bibliothecae medico-practicae et chirurgicae realis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Initia_bibliothecae_medico-practicae_et_chirurgicae_realis(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It was written and printed at said university, where the author was professor of Greek and of theology. The dedication letter addresses it to Michael Meienburg, the mayor of Nordhausen (Thuringia). It is structured in three books, which are concerned with theoretical questions about physics (fol. 9r–102v), with the doctrine of principles (fol. 103r–178r), and with the elements (fol. 178v–206v) respectively. The subject is treated in the manner of a catechism: Questions concerning central aspects and being styled as subtitles are followed by the respective answers. However, the latter are so extensive that the reader soon loses sight of the dialogic aspect. The question-and-answer format thus is little more than a convenient way of structuring the account. Among other things, Melanchthon refutes the Copernican ideas of the movement of the earth and the heliocentric world system. Overall, he acts as an advocate of Aristotelian physics, using Aristotle as his most important authority, as well as other ancient, mainly Greek authors, and theological arguments. The work soon saw no less than 19 reprints until 1587, the second edition (Frankfurt 1550) adding notes and an extensive index. It became the fundament of the teaching of physics at many protestant universities in Germany, and its influence there made itself felt until the 18th century (Pozzo 1998, 279–284).",Bauer 1997Pozzo 1998Ludwig 2008(edition with German translation),"Melanchthon, Philipp‎(← links)Liber de anima‎(← links)Pozzo 1998‎(← links)Bellucci 1988‎(← links)","Melanchthon, Philipp:Initia doctrinae physicae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Initia_doctrinae_physicae(last revision: 13.02.2022).","If ""dictata in academia Vuitebergensi"" in the title is to be taken serious, this is a transcript of lectures given by Melanchthon ad Wittenberg.

"Moffett, Thomas","Insectorum sive minimorum animalium theatrum, olim ab Edoardo Wottono, Conrado Gesnero Thomaque Pennio inchoatum, tandem Thomae Moufeti Londinatis opera sumptibusque maximis concinnatum, auctum, perfectum et ad vivum expressis iconibus supra quingentis illustratum",,1634,London,Cotes,17th century,"Historia, Encyclopedic work","Biology, Medicine",Insectorum theatrum(Google Books),731628,"The gestation of thisTheater of Insects or Very Small Animalswas long and complex. The English physician Thomas Moffett based the work on material collected by Edward Wotton (1492–1555),Conrad Gessnerand Thomas Penny (1532–89). The book was ready for print in 1590, but Moffett found no printer. After his death, the manuscript remained with some of his friends, until it was handed over toThéodore de Mayerne, a physician from Geneva, by a pharmacist called Darnell. Mayerne had it published 30 years after Moffett's death with a dedication to another prominent doctor, William Paddy. The printing history is recorded on the first two pages of the dedication.How exactly Moffett himself got hold of his material and what he did to it – in other words, his role as editor and/or author – is not entirely clear, but he gives at least some hints at the beginning of his preface. He bought a number of letters or manuscripts (litterae) by the deceased Penny and combined their contents with what he apparently already possessed from Gessner and Wotton:Huius igitur et Gesneri Wottonique fragmentis ordine dispositis, addita orationis luce, qua Pennius caruit, historiam texui et pro meis viribus, quae scio quam sint exiguae, tandem absolvi.(""So I put Penny's, Gessner's and Wotton's fragments into good order, added some stylistic lustre, of which Penny was bereft, and composed a coherent account, which I managed to finish according to my abilities, of whose smallness I am well aware."") The rest of the preface is dedicated to a fervent physicotheological justification of entomology, a guiding theme of the entire work: Moffett was a devout Puritan, and he wanted to convince his prospective readers that his book was worth their time and money despite the low esteem in which insects were generally held. The preface is preceded by a useful table of contents (perhaps conceived as a substitute for an index, which is absent) and followed by a catalogue of some 400 authors used as sources.The work itself fills about 330 folio pages and is divided into two books comprising 29 and 42 chapters respectively. Book 1 mostly discusses insects in the present sense of the word, book 2, spiders, wormlike creatures and small water animals. As already in Aristotle and in premodern zoology in general, ""insect"" is thus used as a kind of default category encompassing most of what is not mammal, bird, reptile, amphibium or fish. Like in some other entomological works of the era such asUlisse Aldrovandi'sDe animalibus insectis libri septem(1602), the bees, as the most dignified and useful insects, take pride of place: the first seven chapters are dedicated to them. (They also figure prominently on the title page.) The single chapters are quite heterogeneous in structure and content. Some are dedicated to one kind of insect only, others to a certain class of insects (ch. 1.14, for instance, treats butterflies) or to several different animals (ch. 1.28, the scorpion, the ant and the flea). The length of a chapter varies from less than one to 19 pages. A fairly detailed chapter like the one on wasps (ch. 1.8, pp. 41–49) may start from a list of names in some 15 languages and a short discussion of these, before proceeding to outward appearance, character, varieties, lifespan, nutrition, usefulness, habitat and medical aspects. These headings are indicated by marginalia and fleshed out with generous quotations from Moffett's sources. However, the actual headings of different chapters vary greatly. As the full title boasts, the work contains over 500 woodcut illustrations, although most are quite small and they are added to the margins rather then presented on separate tables.Concerning Moffett's style, his pride in it was justified. His descriptions of the small animals and their behaviour bespeak a keen eye and are noteworthy for their clarity and precision. A kind of freshwater worm and its locomotion, for instance, is characterised as follows (ch. 2.42, p. 325):Cauda iis bifurca, qua se firmant ac sustentant, dum capite elevato locum invenerint, ubi reliquum figant corpus. Tum supra limum ac saxa incedunt et vibratili quodam modo sese arcuatim promovent.Their tail is forked. They use it to stand firmly, so that they can raise their head, until they find a place where to put the rest of their body. Then, they move over mud and stones, proceeding in a kind of swinging motion, in sweeps.Despite its belated publication, the ""Theater of Insects"" is among the first important encyclopedic works of its kind. Less comprehensive and visually less impressive than Aldrovandi's monumental tome, it is at the same time less rambling, more to the point and clearer. It earned the praise ofAlbrecht von Hallerand still strikes one as a considerable achievment today.","Bäumer 1991–1996, 382–387Pinon 1995, 114–115<""Moffet, Thomas"" inDictionary of National Biography, vol. 38, 101–03","Moffett, Thomas‎(← links)","Moffett, Thomas:Insectorum theatrum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Insectorum_theatrum(last revision: 25.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,
"Gassendi, Pierre","Institutio astronomica iuxta hypotheseis tam veterum quam Copernici et Tychonis, dictata a Petro Gassendo, regio matheseos professore. Eiusdem Oratio inauguralis iterato edita.",,1647,Paris,Heuqueville,17th century,"Textbook, Other (see description), Oration",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Institutio astronomica(Google Books),732894,"After Pierre Gassendi was appointed professor of mathematics at the Collège Royal in 1645, the first course he gave was an introduction to astronomy. When he was approached by the Parisian printer-publisher Louis de Heuqueville, he converted his lectures into the presentTextbook of Astronomy, the first work of its kind to openly discuss the merits and disadvantages of the Ptolemaic, Copernican, and Tychonian world systems. The work is dedicated to Alphonse-Louis du Plessis de Richelieu, the elder brother of Cardinal Richelieu. The letter of dedication (fols. a ii r– a iv v) tells of its gestation and announces the major novelty contained in it. The usual letter to the reader is replaced by an introductory section titledProoemialia(approximately ""matters to be explained beforehand"", pp. 1–6), where Astronomy is defined and some remarks on its historical development are made. At the end (p. 6), Gassendi justifies his decision to present three different world systems, but remains silent about his personal conviction (which must have been known to many contemporaries from his earlier work) that Copernicus was in fact right and his competitors wrong. Rather, the Ptolemaic system is presented as the most common by the phraseiuxta receptam vulgo sententiam(""according to the commonly approved opinion""), while the popularity of Copernicus' and Brahe's systems is acknowledged as well: They already have become very famous (quae percelebria iam evaserint) and attracted the favour of important astronomers (quorum utrumque nobiles fautores adipiscitur). The volume is concluded by a new edition of Gassendi's inaugural oration from 1645.The textbook's structure is easy to grasp from the neat table of contents inserted between dedication andprooemialia. The work comprises 222 quarto pages and is divided into three books. Book 1 deals with spherical astronomy according to Ptolemy, book 2, with theorical astronomy according to the same, and book 3, with the systems of Copernicus and Brahe. While the traditional division into spherical and theorical astronomy is thus maintained (as it is, for instance, in Maestlin'sEpitome astronomiaeand Kepler'sEpitome astronomiae Copernicanae), the last book presents a structural innovation. Within the first two books, novel material occurs as well. Chapter 1.19, for instance, is dedicated to refraction, ch. 2.12 to parallax, the following chapters (2.13, 2.14) to the distance of the celestial bodies from the earth and to their true size.Book 3 explains the two new world systems, expounds the motifs behind their invention, explains their advantages and responds to objections. As in the introductory parts, Gassendi does not lay his cards on the table. He even expressedly refuses to act as the advocate of any system, especially of the Copernican one:Neque enim nos alioquin sponsores vadesque ipsius praestamus(p. 155). Moreover, he presents both systems in indirect speech throughout, recording only the arguments of their proponents without making them his own. The advantages of the model of Copernicus are only acknowledged implicitly through the length at which it is explained (eleven chapters, as opposed to four for Brahe)  and through the conclusion of the work's respective section with four chapters in which the Copernicans convincingly refute all objections to their system (chs. 3.8–11). That Ptolemy must be wrong may be deduced by attentive readers from the combination of two passages from books 2 and 3 which allude to the fact that Venus and Mercury can be situated at greater distance from the earth than the sun (pp. 130–131, 214). The same readers will also have understood the implications of pp. 204–205, where Galilei's condemnation is discussed, for Gassendi's own stance. The subtle ways in which the Copernican system is presented as superior to the others in theInstitutio astronomicaare explained in detail byPantin 2012, 80–90.Gassendi is an impressive teacher. His account is well-structured and makes for pleasant reading. Unfamiliar terms likeadspectus(p. 134) are explained simply and precisely. For Greek words, Gassendi often comes up with self-made Latin loan translations. In many cases, a phenomenon's explanation is coupled with an account of the historical development of its treatment in astronomy (see e.g. the discussion of theclimata, pp. 48–51). Gassendi's Latin is carefully polished but never becomes intricate. He is unafraid of long periods, but these are so well-structured that they pose no serious challenge to the reader (p. 214). The clarity maintained in the third book despite the fact that most of it is in indirect speech represents a particular achievement. One encounters the usual diagrams, and figures are routinely given in the text, but there are no tables (as in Kepler'sEpitome astronomiae Copernicanae, for instance), no elaborate calculations and no geometrical proofs. This low degree of mathematisation renders the book accessible to beginners and amateurs. An educated, but non-expert audience also will have enjoyed the occasional insertion of some poetry. On p. 167, for instance, an observer's inability to ascertain whether he or the observed object is in motion is illustrated by Virgil,Aeneid3.72:Provehimur portu terraeque urbesque recedunt(""We sail out of the haven, and lands and cities recede"").Up to 1727, that is, for a full 80 years, theInstitutio astronomicawas reedited and reprinted a dozen times at home and abroad. In one edition (London 1653), it is combinded with Galilei'sSidereus nuntiusand Kepler'sDioptrice, which shows that it was seen as a contribution to a decidedly modern, post-Ptolemaic astronomy. A French adaptation appeared as well (Pantin 2012, 69–70). Despite the work's  origin in a course, its subsequent use in formal teaching is hard to pin down (something true of most early modern works commonly labeled as textbooks). However, it seems clear that at least in England, for instance at Cambridge, professors really based their teaching on it  (Pantin 2012, 80).","Gingerich 1990, 192Pantin 2012","Gassendi, Pierre‎(← links)","Gassendi, Pierre:Institutio astronomica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Institutio_astronomica(last revision: 19.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,
"Boerhaave, Herman",Institutiones medicae in usus annuae exercitationis domesticos digestae ab Hermanno Boerhaave,,1708,Leiden,Johannis vander Linden,18th century,Textbook,Medicine,Institutiones medicae(Google Books),746789,"On 250 octavo pages, theseMedical Instructionssummarize an introduction to medicine taught by  Herman Boerhaave at the University of Leiden. As the full title and the very short, but affectionate, dedication to his students make clear, the respective lecture course lasted one year and provided a first overview of the discipline. The book was intended to spare the students the labour of writing down everything said by Boerhaave and to help them avoid the errors creeping in in the process. The phraselineas ducit, intra quas annuus mihi vobiscum definitur labor(""it draws the lines by which my work with you during the year is circumscribed"") implies that Boerhaave actually said more in class than is contained in the book, which is confirmed by the posthumous, commented edition of the lecture course itself through Albrecht von Haller (Praelectiones academicae in proprias Institutiones rei medicae, 6 vols., Göttingen, 1739–44). Obviously, the students were supposed to buy a copy of theInstitutiones medicaeand to annotate it during the lectures.The work is divided into four sections titled, in Greek, ΠΡΟΛΕΓΟΜΕΝΑ (""Introduction"", pp. 1–9), ΦΥΣΙΟΛΟΓΙΚΗ (""Physiology"", pp. 9–139), ΠΑΘΟΛΟΓΙΑ (""Pathology"", pp. 140–214) and ΘΕΡΑΠΕΥΤΙΚΗ (""Therapeutics"", pp. 215–250). Boerhaave thus distances himself from the older quinquepartion of medicine into principles of nature, diagnosis, prognosis, dietetics and treatment (Cook 2006, 409–410). The single sections are divided further by subheadings; moreover, there is a running division into 1002 short paragraphs.Boerhaave's style is concise, terse and to the point. Sometimes the train of thought is advanced and the account enlivened by questions. Regarding the various kinds of food, for instance, the author asks:Cur homo a tam acribus, duris, acutis non magis laeditur? Docet nota oesophagi, stomachi, intestinorum compages adeo diversa a structura reliquorum viscerum.(""Why does man suffer no greater harm by so pointed, hard, sharp substances? The answer is given by the texture of oesophagus, stomach, bowels, which is very different from that of the other inner parts."") Apart from this catechismlike feature, no contact is made with the reader. Rather, fact after fact is stated in the third-person indicative. New subjects are usually introduced by stipulative definitions. This even goes for such seemingly self-evident notions asvitaorsanitas(§ 29). Also the technical terminology, including some Greek terms, is introduced in this way. Cross-references abound.Presumably due to their exhaustiveness, brevity and clarity, but also to the fame of their author, theInstitutiones medicaebecame a bestseller. They were reprinted all over Europe until 1775 at least . Moreover, the publication of the corresponding lecture course (see above) meant that later professors had a ready-made package at their disposal: they could simply repeat Boerhaave's lecture and recommend his textbook to their students.",,"Boerhaave, Herman‎(← links)Institutiones medicinae‎(← links)","Boerhaave, Herman:Institutiones medicae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Institutiones_medicae(last revision: 09.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

A later example of this subgenre is provided by Herman Boerhaave'sInstitutiones medicae.As befits the author's prominent position, the work features an elaborate array of introductory paratexts. Van Heurne dedicates it to the the influential merchant, politician, book collector and patron Heinrich Rantzau, who was Danish governor of Holstein at the time. The ensuing letter to the reader is written by Pieter Pauw, a former pupil of Heurne who has become professor at Leiden himself. Pauw explains that he was looking for a textbook for beginners but could not find anything suitable, as all the works he consulted were too longwinded, too obscure or written in an off-putting style. In this situation, he remembered an introductory lecture course of his former teacher and asked him for permission to print it. After some hesitation, van Heurne obliged, thoroughly revised his manuscript and gave it to Pauw. After Pauw's letter, eight epigrams and short elegies, three of them in Greek, extol van Heurne and his work. Appended to theInstitutiones medicaethemselves, there is aModus ratioque studendifor medical students, a guidebook similar to theBibliotheca medici eruditiand theManuductio ad medicinamprecedingDe scriptis medicis libri duo, as well as a subject index  comprising 18 pages. The combination of an introduction to the field itself and some guidance to the practical aspects of its study must have made van Heurne's book particularly attractive for freshmen.TheInstitutionesthemselves comprise 577 octavo pages and are divided into twelve books (a number suggesting completeness and comprehensiveness) of increasing length. The order of the books presents a variant of the Galenic division of medicine into five parts. Books 1–5 (De elementis,De temperamentis,De facultatibus[""On vital functions""],De humoribus,De procreatione hominis) cover physiology, the following three books (De morborum differentiis,De morborum causis,De symptomatis) pathology. Next comes semiotics (books 9–10,De urinis,De pulsibus et respiratione), followed by prognostics (book 11,De prognosi) and therapeutics (book 12,De methodo medendi).Pauw's aforementioned criticism of earlier textbooks primarily concerns their style. Van Heurne's own style is syntactically simple and lexically moderately classicizing. He is not afraid of collocations reminiscent of scholastic Latin such asfacultas pulsifica(""pulse-generating ability"", p. 379), but such terms of the technical language of medicine as would be obscure to beginners are used sparingly and always explained. Van Heurne's greatest strength is his ability to expound facts, notions and relationships in simple words. The cooperation of pulse and respiration in preserving an animal's life, for example, is set forth and their concomitant treatment justified as follows (p. 380):Cum eiusdem usus causa respiratio et pulsus dati sint animantibus, iure pulsibus respirationem subnectimus. Hoc solum differunt, quod hic extra arbitrii nostri potestatem, illa fere libera sit. Differunt in instrumento, numero motuum et facultate. In usu et fine conveniunt.Since respiration and pulses are given to living beings for the same use, I rightly attach the respiration to the pulses. They only differ in that the former is outside the power of our will, the latter quite free. They differ in their organ, number of movements and capacity. In their use and end, they join forces.The grammatical and stylistic looseness which is evident in this example presumably testifies to the oral origin of the work (highlighted already by the expressionexceptae ex dictantis eius orein the full title). Van Heurne switches from the pluralpulsibusto the singularhic, usesliberain the sense ofnostri liberi arbitrii, and repeatsdifferuntwithout any stylistic point, just to add some supplementary thoughts. However, non of this impedes the easy readability of theInstitutiones.Van Heurne's reputation and the virtues of his treatment earned the book a remarkable success. It was republished the following year and five more times after the author's death, in 1609, 1611, 1627, 1638, and 1666.",,"Heurne, Johan van‎(← links)","Heurne, Johan van:Institutiones medicinae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Institutiones_medicinae(last revision: 09.01.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

After some time, analogous works began to be composed on various subfields of the discipline as well. The presentInstructions in Legal Medicineare one of the thematically more exotic examples of this kind, as they deal with a branch of medical knowledge which emerged only in the 17th century. Their author Hermann Friedrich Teichmeyer was a professor of medicine (and experimental philosophy) at the University of Jena and published the workfor the benefit of his auditory, as noted towards the bottom of the title page.After a short dedication to the author's overlords, the Dukes of Saxony, the preface informs the reader that the work originated as a lecture manuscript based on which Teichmeyer had already given several courses on the subject. Now, he has polished it for publication:Offero tibi, honoratissime lector, Institutiones meas medicinae legalis in usum auditorum ante elaboratas et praelectionibus, quibus eas illustravi, saepius iteratis ansam praebentes[the print has an ungrammaticalpraebentibus], ad hanc, quae publicum videre non veretur, formam tandem deductas.After the main text, the work is concluded by a table of contents, a long subject index, and a rudimentary bibliography (index auctorum).The main text comprises 256 pages and is structured in 25 chapters, which are subdivided into shorter segments consisting of questions and answers: as many textbooks of its time, the work formally presents itself as a catechism. In terms of content, it covers all kinds of subjects which may require a physician's expertise in court, with a strong emphasis on familiy law. The first chapter discusses the different ages of life so far as they are important in legal matters. Next comes a long section (chs. 2–16) comprising more than half of the book and concerned with aspects of marriage and offspring like primogeniture, abdominal delivery, virginity, pregnancy, birth, and impotence. Chs. 17–18 treat the simulation and dissimulation of illnesses, chs. 19, the plague. Poisoning and the inspection of corpses are discussed in chs. 20–21. This is followed by a discussion of lethal wounds (chs. 22–23) and infanticide (ch. 24). The final chapter concerns itself with torture and physical punishment (ch. 25).Teichmeyer is well-read in his field and not shy to show it. Quoting scores of physicians and jurists, he particularly relies on the early modern classic of legal medicine, theQuaestiones medico-legales(1621–1651) by the Roman physician and jurist Paul Zacchias. However, Teichmeyer does not follow him, or any other authority, blindly, quite the opposite. He is fond of discussing cases in which his predecessors dissent from one another. At the end, he either gives his own opinion or leaves the matter open. On the question of primogeniture in the case of twins, which in the case of a ruler's offspring can create tricky succession problems, he notes (p. 12):Quaestio nulla est, in cuius decisione magis varient doctores quam haec, quis nempe gemellorum prior natus haberi debeat, si forte obstetricum incuria aliove simili casu id ignoretur. Alii utrumque, alii neutrum, alii praestantiorem admittunt, alii electioni parentum, alii procerum decisioni in successione imperii huius dubii resolutionem committunt, alii ad sortem confugiunt.""There is no question whose decision is more contested among academic teachers than the following, namely which of two twins should be judged firstborn, if this is perchance unknown due to the carelessness ot the midwives or some similar accident. Some favour both, some none, some him who looks better and stronger, some relinquish the resolution of this doubt regarding the succession to the throne to the parents' choice, some to the decision of the nobles, some take refuge with drawing lots.""Although Teichmeyer freely uses medical and juridical terminology when necessary, his Latin is grammatically classical and not hard to read, as evident from this quotation. On occasion, its elegance its obscured by long strings of citations inserted into the running text (there are no footnotes). Sometimes, a short passage is translated into German or the whole account switches to that language for a few sentences for no clear reason (e.g. pp. 235–240). In terms of content, the work contains much interesting information about the mentality of doctors and jurists in the early German Enlightenment. Female practitioners like midwives, for instance, are generally viewed with suspicion and disdain, as in the above example. About sexual matters, Teichmeyer talks without the least restraint, as in chapter 4,De virginitate, where he openly discusses the contested existence of the hymen and the methods to confirm or refute alleged virginity. In the final chapter, one has the impression that he would like to see torture abolished altogether, like many of his colleagues at the time, although he is not outspoken about the matter, since torture was still practiced in the Duchy of Saxony (it was banned only in 1770). At least, he tries to restrict the severity of torture and to exclude as many groups of people as possible from it.",,"Teichmeyer, Hermann Friedrich‎(← links)","Teichmeyer, Hermann Friedrich:Institutiones medicinae legalis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Institutiones_medicinae_legalis(last revision: 09.08.2021).","Ch.

In second chapter, the first partprotheoriaexplains the logical structure of Euclid's ""Elements"" so that the reader knows what to make of ""theorems"", ""propositions"", ""problems"" or ""proofs"". This is due to geometry being so strongly tied to the presentation by Euclid in the 16th century.In all chapters one finds the same sub-structure: The notions are introduced and explained by questions and answers (Quid est theorema?).

Teachers of astronomy reacted comparatively quickly to these enormous challenges – first, as one would have expected, in England – but their reactions differed widely. In 1702,David Gregoryproduced the first introduction to Newtonian astronomy, theAstronomiae physicae et geometricae elementa, which were quite advanced and took Newtonian physics fully into account. Sixteen years later, Gregory's pupil and successor as Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, John Keill, followed suit with a somewhat less technical book, theIntroduction to True Astronomy or Astronomical Lectures. As its title indicates, this work was based on a lecture course given by Keill.After a dedication to James Brydges, first Duke of Chandos, thepraefatiois for the better part concerned with praise of astronomy and remarks on its history, which culminates in the achievements of Newton and Gregory (pp. I–XIII). However, Keill thinks Gregory's book, which mixes the description of astronomical phenomena with the analysis of their physical causes, to be too difficult for students. He therefore promises to leave out physics and to restrict himself to the movements of the celestial bodies and the resulting phenomena. The preface ends with some user instructions: It is explained how students may employ Keill's book in tandem with his lectures (which he intends to repeat), what previous knowledge they need, and which parts they may skip, if they find them too demanding (pp. XIII–XV). The volume is concluded by anIndex rerum et terminorum, which implies that it is intended not only as a textbook, but as a reference work as well.The main part comprises some 500 quarto pages. It is subdivided into 30 lectures (see appendix), arranged in an order whose rationale is hard to grasp. What is visible at one glance is the fact that the  bipartition into spherical and planetary astronomy, a defining characteristic of the earlier textbook tradition, has gone. As promised in the preface, most of Keill's account is understandable for beginners. There is no physics, and most mathematics is elementary. (Exceptions can be found in chs. XIV, which presents a new method of calculating solar eclipses, and in chs. XXIV and XXV, where partial areas of ellipses are computed. Inexperienced readers are warned of these disproportionally technical parts and some similar passages in the preface, pp. XIV–XV.) The price of this comparative simplicity, of course, is that theIntroduction to True Astronomycannot really be called a Newtonian textbook. Truly Newtonian traits such as the postulation of a world full of suns and without a sphere of fixed stars (pp. 42–43) or the calculations in ch. XXV are few and far between. Most mentions of Newton's name are just honorary and decorative (e.g. pp. 27, 363). In the index, even an entry for gravity is missing. It is only consistent that Keill advises readers to continue with Gregory's more advanced textbook after having digested his own (preface, p. XV).Keill's Latin is clear, and he has a gift for explaining complex issues in simple words. His lucid  style is helped by the customary diagrams and by marginalia, which keep the reader oriented. On occasion, Keill also tries to enthuse his readers for his subject and to fill them with awe and wonder, painting impressive vistas and making use the high style (genus grande). In ch. III, for example, he provides a guided tour through the Universe, applying the technique of the space-travelling observer, as one could call it, which was perhaps introduced into astronomical textbooks in the final book ofGregory's work, there being calledastronomia comparativa: The reader is asked to position himself at various points within the Universe and to imagine how it would look from there – for instance, from the very centre of the sun (p. 23):Spectator itaque solis centrum tenens et caelum intuens superficiem eius sphaericam, cavam, oculo concentricam innumerisque stellis, quas fixas dicimus, undique refertam videbit.(""So when standing in the centre of the sun and looking at the sky, the observer will perceive its surface as spherical, hollow, having his own eye as the centre and being filled with innumerable stars of the kind we call 'fixed'."")Keill's introduction to Newtonian astronomy was a great success, not only in England, but on the continent as well. It was republished in Latin, sometimes together with its physical counterpart, theIntroductio ad veram physicam(1715). Moreover, there appeared translations into English, Dutch and French. In some form or other, the work remained in print until the end of the 18th century.APPENDIX: List of the 30 Single LecturesI. De motu visibili seu apparenteII.

"Euler, Leonhard",Introductio in analysin infinitorum,,1748,Lausanne,Bousquet,18th century,Textbook,Mathematics,Introductio in analysin infinitorum(e-rara),906120,"This textbook is seminal for the development of mathematics, and in particular to the discipline of ""analysis"", for several reasons:For the first time, the function (functio) is the central object of interest, as Euler lays out in thepraefatioand which becomes clear by the organisation of the work. This constitutes a huge paradigm shift in differential calculus from geometrically interpreted curves to the rules how variables depend on each other. Tellingly, the first tome which rolls out the fundamentals on functions does completely without a single diagram.The book contains one epoch making result after the other: Definitions and relations of Euler's number and the natural logarithm, the complex exponential, the relation of the latter with trigonomentric functions, their representations as series and products and applications to various problems in- and outside pure mathematics. This demonstrates the central role of Euler's number ""e"" and the exponential function exin analysis.The textbook format was very suitable to propagate Euler's ideas. Built on didactic principles, the work is easily comprehensible and became the most important and most studied book on analysis of the 18th century.Contents1Structure and Content1.1Tome I: ""On Functions of Variable Quantities""1.2Tome II: ""Theory of Curved Lines, with an Appendix on Surfaces""2Style and ImpactStructure and ContentThe work is organized in two tomes (quarto books) of some 400 pages each, where the first one treats notions and results on elementary functions and their various representations. The second tome is on analytic geometry and the first methods of the beginning discipline of differential geometry.Tome I: ""On Functions of Variable Quantities""The first tome starts with a frontispiece entitled ""Analyse des infiniment-petits"", the title of a textbook on differential calculus by l'Hôpital. Then comes the titlepage proper, with a small picture bearing the printer's (Marc-Michel Bousquet) mottoLatius sub aegide lucebit. The dedication letter to the scientist Jean Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan is also by Bousquet. After these preliminaries, Euler jumpsin medias reswith his preface, declaring the function to be the central object of analysis and laying out the plan and contents of the two tomes. This part is rounded off with anindex capitumof both tomes.The following eighteen chapters present a theory of elementary functions and their results. The chapters themselves are subdivided in 382 consecutively numbered paragraphs which alleviates references within the book. We pick out only some of the content.In chapter 1, the notion of a function is introduced in the form of what is called an ""analytic function"" today. Euler requests an ""analytic expression"" of the numbers and variables (Functio quantitatis variabilis, est expressio analytica quomodocunque composito ex illa quantitate variabili, et numeri seu quantitatibus constantibus).The second chapter deals with factorisation of algebraic and a partial fraction decomposition of rational functions using the fundamental theorem of algebra, a result which Euler was not able to show (and which was clarified byGausslater). However, this lack of mathematical rigour is typical for theIntroductio.In chapter 4, Euler makes the bold claim that all functions could be represented as an infinite power series and tries to convince the reader by some examples. He also uses the binomial series found byNewton(§71) but gives no derivation or proof.In chapter 6, logarithms are computed by rekursive root extractions and some applications to music theory (§110), population growth or debt management are given in order to underline the advantages of using logarithms in practical calculations.In chapter 7, Euler derives power series for the exponential functions and logarithms and demonstrates their significance for the determination of log2, log3, ... , log10 whose first 25 digits are determined with ease by this method. The only flaw is the problematic use of ""infinitely small"" and ""infinitely large"" numbers with which many results are derived fast and elegantly (but not rigorously, which gave rise to criticism).Chapter 8 on trigonometric functions starts with a definition of sine and cosine in the unit circle and using radians, a novel and lasting definition. He introduces the greek letter π for the half circumference of the unit circle, presents Euler's formula on the relationship of the complex exponential and trigonometric functions. As an application, Euler uses these series in order to calculate many digits of π (.Chapter 9 derives a product representation of the sine function. With this and what is later called ""Riemann's Zeta function"" (topic of chapter 10), Euler findsWallis'sproduct representationof π as a byproduct in chapter 11 (§185) and easily calculates log π.After results on recursive series (chapter 13) and partitions (chapter 16), chapter 18 opens even a completely new field: continued fractions.Tome II: ""Theory of Curved Lines, with an Appendix on Surfaces""The second part contains analytic geometry (description and classification of algebraic and transcendental curves including the classical conic sections and other well known examples) and differential geometry (finding tangents and curvatures of curves) in 22 chapters and 540 consecutively numbered paragraphs. In contrast to the first tome, the margins bear references to 40 tables of figures depicting the curves mentioned in the text which is hardly comprehensible without these pictures. At the end one finds a note for the bookbinder (in French, Latin, Italian and German) who is advised to bind the 40 copperplate etchings to the first tome, as it is shorter and furthermore, this would allow one to study both pictures and text at the same time.Style and ImpactGuided by the genre of textbook, Euler writes in a clear and comprehensible style. Mathematical rigor is sometimes dropped in the favor of a simpler presentation (or because a rigorous proof was not (yet) and hand). Sometimes claims which could not be proved were just corroborated by several convincing and relatively general examples.The impact in analysis was already mentioned above, and was even stronger if one considers all three parts of the analytic trilogy of textbooks:Introductio in analysin infinitorum(1748),Institutiones calculi differentialis(1755) andInstitutiones calculi integralis(three tomes 1768-70). Euler coins terminology, symbols, and especially the paradigm of functions in analysis. Most of this is done in the first tome of theIntroductio.But all these incredible results revealed at the same time a huge problem in infinitesimal calculus: The missing foundations. Euler's reckoning with infinitely small and large numers were common in the 18th century, yet not exact. Although hinted to in some cases, Euler makes also no convergence analysis of his power series. Finally, the definition of a function was not sustainable. Already in theInstitutiones, and inspired by the problem of an oscillating chord, Euler had to change his notion of function to the more or less modern one of a unique mapping.Only Cauchy, Weierstraß, Dirichlet and others finally tamed infinity in analysis until some 100 years later.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 4, 476–484Edwards 1979, chapter 10.Euler; Walter 1983(reprint of the 1885 German translation by Maser; esp. introduction by W.

Scheffer heaps fulsome praise on Conring at many occasions, and it seems obvious that the disputation and the publication were conceived, among other things, as an advertisement of the latter's expertise and teaching.Scheffer dedicates the work to several patrons, to whom he also addresses himself in its preface. After a table of contents and an epigram in praise of Scheffer, theIntroductiofalls into 13 chapters filling 240 quarto pages. The chapters are partly dedicated to preliminary matters (medicine in general; medical schools; history of medicine and medical literature, chs. I–III), partly to the traditional five parts of medicine (chs. IV–VII, XIII) and further aspects, some of which reflect recent developments (chs. IIX-XII: simples; minerals and animals; botany; pharmacology and chemistry; surgery). Each chapter is subdivided into several paragraphs (calledtheses, as customary in disputation prints). Most start from a theoretical overview of the respective issue, illustrated by some examples, and concludes with abibliographie raisonnéeof the most important writers in the field, from Greeks and Arabs to medieval and early modern authors. Both parts can also be fused, as in ch. 7, where the main aspects of therapy and the respective authorities are discussed jointly. To some degree, the work anticipates  the structure of thehistoriae literariaeof the later 17th and 18th centuries, such as Morhof'sPolyhistor.TheIntroductiois clearly structured, its train of thought is coherent and frequently made explicit, and Scheffer writes a fluent, neat, and plain Latin. An impression of these qualities can be given on the basis of the initial sentences of ch. IIX (p. 152):Ut itaque de simplicibus medicamentis agamus, operae pretium est nonnulla in genere praemittere, quae ad universum illud studium scitu ac observatu necessaria sunt. Diffusum enim illud est nec levem requirit industriam. Appellamus autem simplicia medicamenta omnia illa sanitatis recuperandae, quaecumque sine ulla artificis ope sola natura produxit, ut perinde sit ac si nativa medicamenta nuncupentur.Let us now discuss simple medicines. It is worthwhile to start from some general remarks about this discipline as a whole and must necessarily be known and heeded. For this discipline is extensive and needs no superficial assiduity. We call simple medicines all those substances serving to recover one's health which nature alone has produced without any help of a craftsman, so that it is the same as if they would be called original medicines.Conring's and Scheffer's manual must have proven helpful to students and perhaps also to experienced physicians who wanted quick information and literature on some particular aspect of their craft. The book enjoyed considerable and lasting popularity over many decades.

The invitation is announced on the title page and followed by a short apologetic text of ca. 5 pages defending anatomy against wide-spread prejudice.The text opens with a priamel: the other branches of medicine are appreciated and revered – in contrast, anatomy is hated by most, even by some physicians. The author takes on the belief that anatomy is a „dirty“ thing, which persists in spite of the cleanliness of the actual anatomical practice (e.g. anatomists use instruments rather than their hands and wash their hands and change their clothes after a dissection). He amits there are cases of abuse (he cites using a human skull as a wine cup, vivisections and dissections of infectious bodies). However, this does not mean that anatomy cannot be useful or has to be horrifying: the author provides a detailed list of measures to avoid fear or disgust in anatomical dissections (e.g. to wash the body, to not show the entire, to cover the head with a veil, to remove the intestines and to staunch the flow of blood from the major blood vessels). At the end, the invitation of the title page is reiterated: the public dissection of the female body will demonstrate that there is nothing dirty about anatomy. In the last lines, we find an indication of the intended audience (the prorector, the ducal councillors, the leading men of the university and of the city of Rostock, as well as all university-educated citizens of all ranks) and the date and time of the event (23 February 1753, 4 p.m.). The leaflet closes with atessera anatomica(a password, or ticket, for the public dissection):Natura nil turpis in se continet(""Nature does not contain anything disgraceful"").Invitations were, of course, ephemeral prints with a limited circulation. But the present example offers an interesting glimpse into how Latin could be used in a local context in order to delineate an academic audience (and exclude non-Latinate audiences). It also shows that invitations could be outlets for discussing more general issues of scientific culture and attitudes towards scientific practices, putting a specific event in a wider context. In the case of this leaflet from Rostock, the intention is perhaps twofold: to present Detharding's public dissection as useful and legitimate, and to dispel any fears the invitees might have about attending the event. The public dissection of 1753 is the sixth recorded for Detharding (cf.Schumacher; Wischhusen 1970, 71) as well as the last of seventeen recorded for 18th-century Rostock (cf. ibid., 176-77).","Schumacher; Wischhusen 1970, esp. 69–72 (on Georg Christoph Detharding) and 172–77 (on public dissections in Rostock)","Detharding, Georg Christoph‎(← links)","Detharding, Georg Christoph:Invitatio ad anatomiam publicam, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Invitatio_ad_anatomiam_publicam(last revision: 20.01.2022).","complete list of measures: wash the body, shave body hair, cover the head, not show the entire body at once, remove intestines, tie off major blood vessels to prevent the flow of blood, cover the smell with spirit of wine and perfume (or incense; the Latin word issuffitibus), not show genitals, when showing muscles, avoid showing the whole body without skin",MK,Yes,IT,

B2v):Io, Europa, Ganymedes puer atque Calistolascivo nimium perplacuere Iovi.""Io, Europa, the boy Ganymede and Callisto took the fancy of lustful Jupiter excessively.""Marius’s solution to the naming problem was to resort to poetry, in particular to Ovid’sMetamorphoses, and to attribute the name of four famous love interests of Jupiter – Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto – to the four satellites of Jupiter. The distich then has the function of a summary, marking the end of the discussion in prose.After the distich, interestingly, Marius informs us that the poem (hoc figmentum) and the names (propriorum nominum impositio) originated from a meeting withJohannes Keplerin Regensburg in October 1613, whom he jokingly calls the godfather (compater) of the four stars (fol. B2v).That the distich might also be intended to serve as a mnemonic verse is indicated by the fact that the four satellites are fitted into the hexameter in the correct order, accepting some minor metrical slips: here, the second syllable ofGanymedesis long instead of short, while the first syllable ofCal(l)istois short instead of long.

First, the anonymous author determines Sacrobosco'sfloruitfrom his work and relates that he was from England, but came to Paris to study, where he spent his remaining life and published theSphaeraand theComputus ecclesiasticus. The author ends by briefly describing Sacrobosco's tomb in the monastery of Saint-Mathurin in Paris and quoting Sacrobosco's epitaph.The scarceness of reliable information on Sacrobosco is emphasised throughout the short text (e.g.De patria eius nihil aliud habemus, quam quod veluti per manus a maioribus traditum accepimus, or:Obiit illic, cum opusculum de sphaera et computum ecclesiasticum edidisset, sed quoto aetatis anno, id non traditur).

Its contents may be summarized as follows. After having announced his theme, Noceti begins by contrasting the correct explanation of the rainbow, based on the reflection and refraction of sunlight in raindrops, with older, false explanations such as chthonic exhalations or the concave form of some clouds (1-69). He then sets out the fundamentals of Newtonian optics (reflexion, refraction, composite nature of sunlight, different angles of refraction for different colours, 70-172), before turning to the rainbow itself. In meticulous detail, the beam path within a single drop of water is analysed: The beam is refracted when it enters the drop, reflected from the drop’s back side and refracted a second time when it exits the drop (173-242). The resulting angle of refraction varies between 40° for blue and 42° for red (243-289). This is confirmed by Experience – Experience, which will expand the boundaries of human knowledge further and further in the future, as promised in a digression (290-345). Next, Noceti moves back from the microscopic to the macroscopic level and shows how the mechanisms he has described do indeed lead to the appearance of a rainbow (346-388). To the scientific explanation, a mythological one is added, invented by Noceti himself; it traces the rainbow’s origin back to an unhappy love story between the nymph Iris and a certain Xanthus, who is finally changed into the homonymous river near Troy (389-444). The poem concludes with a shorter discussion of the secondary rainbow, caused by that part of the sunlight which is reflected not once but twice within the single drops (445-516).As many scientific didactic epics of its day, Iris seriously attemps to enable the reader to understand the phenomenon in question. In doing so, the poem makes generous use of the whole didactic toolkit of the Lucretian tradition (e.g., clear structure, careful explanation of unfamiliar terminology, visualisation through metaphors and similes, close contact with the reader). In accordance with its Lucretian attitude, the poem's language also draws heavily not only on Virgil, but also on his Epicurean predecessor.First printed in 1731 in Venice, the text was substantially enlarged and furnished with a commentary by the great Jesuit scientist (and didactic poet)Ruđer Josip Boškovićin the Roman edition of 1747, on which this description is based. Two years after, it was taken over in slightly reduced form and without the commentary into the great collection of didactic epics edited by François Oudin,Poemata didascalica Latina, Paris 1749 (vol. 2, 204-223). It was reprinted together with the rest of this collection as late as 1813.","Tautschnig 2017,Tautschnig 2020","Poemata didascalica‎(← links)Noceti, Carlo‎(← links)Naiden 1952‎(← links)De obscuritate philosophiae ac de repertis Isaaci Newtoni‎(← links)Dissertatio physica de iride‎(← links)Anti-Newtonianismus‎(← links)Optica‎(← links)","Noceti, Carlo:Iris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Iris(last revision: 19.09.2022).","Oudin im share folder.Die Anm. sagen zu Beginn (p. 19), das Gedicht sei 1729 im Collegio Romano vom Autor selbst vorgetragen und wenig später in Venedg „in collectione opusculorum Albritana“ gedruckt worden.Die Anm. sind noch genauer anzusehen.Das Widmungsschreiben an einen Bernardino Giraudio signaturae iustititae XIIviro enthält leider nicht mehr als einige Gemeinplätze über die unwiderstehliche Anziehungskraft der Naturwissenschaft und das übliche Adressatenlob.",IT,Yes,,

Composed for the later comitia of 1711, the poem, which originally would have been printed on a single sheet of paper, seems to be preserved only in a small collection ofCarmina comitialia Cantabrigiensia, which was edited by Vincent Bourne, a fellow of Trinity College and ""leading Latin poet and practitioner of the genre"" (Fara; Money 2004, 554), and printed in London in 1721.TheIriswas printed seven years after the publication of Newton’sOpticksin 1704. However, Newton's theory of colour and light had been a subject of tripos verses as early as 1680, at a time where it was still controversial, with a poem titledNewtoniana hypothesis recte explicat rationes colorumby Thomas Man of Jesus College (cf.Fara; Money 2004, 555). In the 1711 poemIris, Newton is mentioned neither in the text nor in the title, but Newton's discovery that the spectral colours exist within white light and become visible through reflection can be grasped within the poem. Moreover, the anonymous poet implicitly draws an contrast between the learned man and the farmer, who admires the rainbow because he does not understand that it owes its colours to the sun and his own perception.The 52 hexameters of theIristouch upon a variety of aspects: the rainbow’s origin from rain and sunlight, the refraction of white light into the colours of the rainbow (Newton’s discovery about the nature of light), the continuous circular shape of the rainbow, the rainbow as a purely optical phenomenon, not a real entity, and the paler secondary rainbow, which has the colours in inverted order. Some features of the physics of the rainbow are merely described, without giving an explanation (e.g. the secondary rainbow), some are explained with varying degrees of detail, e.g. the most detailed account is dedicated to the shape of the rainbow, while the origin of the colours is explained rather sketchily.However, the colours of the rainbow are the focus of the poem, which opens with the rainbow goddess Iris’s colourful, harlot-like make-up, which is painted by Apollo (the god of the sun) onto the sky as his canvas, creating, as is later revealed, a splendid optical trick (versuti fallacia splendida Phoebi, v. 30). The imagery of painting and colouring is also taken over into the witty punchline at the end (v. 48–52): why does the poet even try to depict Iris’s colours, if Apollo, who is both the god of the sun and poetry, jealously denies him poetic powers for this topic, as Apollo alone wants to depict his Iris [i.e make the colourful rainbow appear on the sky]?At quid te, Iri, meo depingere carmine conor,cum tibi nulla novos possint afferre colorescarmina?

As the long title indicates, the content of this introduction to botany stems from Jungius’s teachings in privatecollegia, emended and extended by the author himself and subsequently revised and edited by Johannes Vagetius after Jungius’s death. At the back of the title page, are the famous verses on the lilies on the field from the Gospel of Matthew (5.28–29) in Greek and Latin. This is followed by the dedication to four members of the Senate of Hamburg and the respective letter by the editor Vagetius dated 28 August 1678, in which he highlights the importance of plants for humankind. Moreover, – Vagetius states – the identification and correct description especially of medicinal drugs is crucial and Jungius’s work provides not only a good guide to the characteristics (differentiae) of plants but also a sound set of terms for these characteristics. Jungius’s terminology thus enables scholars to write down their observations so that a save identification of plants will still be possible after some centuries ([…] inventis apta imposuit nomina, id denique effecit, ut describi observationum istarum ductu planta quaelibet ita possit, ut post quotcumque saecula ex descriptione ista sine errore agnoscere eam liceat.; fol. )o( 3v).The following page reveals another interesting information. It is stated that works like theIsagogeusually containencomiaby other eminent scholars, but not in this case. Instead, the fact that Werner Rolfinck had already integrated the text of the Jungius’sIsagogein his own botanical workDe vegetabilibus, plantis, suffruticibus. fruticibus et arboribus in genere(book II, sectio IV) is said to be proof enough of the importance of the content. There is, moreover, atabula comparationisbetween the paragraphs in Jungius’sIsagogeand Rolfinck’sDe vegetabilibus, followed by the table of content of theIsagoge.
Jungius’s work itself consists mostly of short definitions of parts of plants in twenty-eight chapters ordered from general to special, subdivided into parts that serve growth (augmentatio) and parts that serve reproduction (‘’generatio’’). Jungius’ introduced quite a number of new terms. There is no really coherent text.
After Jungius’sIsagogefollows a detailed exposition of the editorial process together with readings in the autograph including an alphabetical index of plant names (Monenda), a list of emendations (Emendanda), and errata. Jungius’sIsagogeproved to be very influential and many of his terms are still valid today (Morton 1981, 173).","Morton 1981, 168-173.","Jungius, Joachim‎(← links)","Jungius, Joachim:Isagoge Phytoscopica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Isagoge_Phytoscopica(last revision: 10.01.2022).",,DB,Yes,DB,

The body text comprises a bare 24 octavo pages in large print. The inspiration for this miniature format apparently comes from Petrus Ramus, of whom Scribonius was a declared follower, as his laterTriumphus logicae Rameae(1583) shows.The work is dedicated to a certain Meinhard Knyphausen from Frisia, a friend and former pupil of the author, who had taught logic at Marburg for some time. The dedication starts from a praise of astronomy as a way to approach God who has made the heavens. If many contemporaries despise this divine discipline, the blame rests with its teachers who present it in such a crabbed way that nobody can understand it. Scribonius will give a clear and distinct presentation which does justice to the nature of the subject, without obfuscating matters by the introduction of geometry or arithmetics.Scribonius indeed keeps his promise. He renounces all mathematics and only presents a skeleton, so to speak, of cosmological, astronomical and astrological knowledge without any explanations of why things are the way they are. After a few introductory remarks, the text is broken down into 15 short chapters dealing with the structure of the Universe as a whole, the major circles such as the equator, day, night and the seasons, the minor circles (that is, the tropics and polar circles), the zones, the houses, the rising and setting of the stars, the fixed stars, the planets, and eclipses. Each chapter basically consists of a string of one-sentence-definitions in simple Latin such asMeridianus est circulus mobilis per loci cuiuslibet verticem et mundi polos ductus(""The meridian is a moveable circle running through the zenith of any given place and the celestial poles"", p. 5). The weight carried by each single sentence is underlined by the layout, as it is always printed as a self-contained mini-paragraph. Sometimes, further remarks or a few mnemonic verses (pp. 15, 17, 18) are added in italics and in smaller font.There is no indication that the book was written with any concrete, institutionalised didactic setting in mind. The audience of beginners it apparently targets remains unspecified. On the other hand, the extreme brevity presumably implies that the booklet was cheap enough to be bought by many students and that its contents needed to be explained in greater detail in class. In any case, the simultaneous publication of the work in Frankfurt and in Lemgo seems to indicate a certain demand for such an elementary introduction that could be bought, read and understood by a broad range of people.",,"Scribonius, Wilhelm Adolf‎(← links)","Scribonius, Wilhelm Adolf:Isagoge sphaerica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Isagoge_sphaerica(last revision: 09.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

"Kircher, Athanasius","Iter cometae anni 1664 a 14 Decembris usque ad 30 Romae observatum. Ad serenissimum principem Augustum, ducem Brunsvicium et Luneburgensem",,[1665],not indicated,not indicated,17th century,"Report, Other (see description)",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Iter cometae anni 1664(WDB)German version(UB Goethe Universität Frankfurt a. M.),918559,"In this Latin broadsheet, the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher reports his observation of the comet of 1664 in Rome. Kircher sent his report together with a chart of the comet's path to Duke Augustus of Brunswick-Lüneburg, one of the most intellectual rulers of his time. The text of the report indicates that through his learned gift to Augustus, Kircher hoped to exchange data about the comet with astronomers outside Italy. Indeed, it seems that Augustus facilitated this exchange by having Kircher's manuscript report and chart printed in the form of an easily distributable single-sheet print.We can trace the publication process of the report in Kircher's letters. According to the broadsheet, Kircher observed the comet between 14 and 30 December 1664 and finished his report on 3 January 1665. On 7 February 1665, Kircher sent the material on the comet to Augustus's book agent Johann Georg Anckel (cf.Harms; Schilling 1985, no. I.199a). In a letter to Augustus from21 February 1665, Kircher writes that he trusts the duke has received his observation on the comet. A little more than a month later, on27 March 1665, Kircher writes again to Augustus, this time to thank him for publishing the observation. As Kircher tells it, the publication came as a surprise to him and made him feel ashamed (summo meo rubore), as he had written the text ""on the side and in unpolished style"" (obiter et impolito stylo).The broadsheet was printed in two versions, one with a Latin and one with a German text, probably in parallel or in close succession. The Latin text seems to be the original, as is suggested by a note (apparently in Augustus's own hand) in the Latin broadsheet, concerning an orthographical deviation from the ""autograph""(presumably Kircher's manuscript) (cf.Harms; Schilling 1985, no. I.199a). In addition, the supplementation of contextual information in the German text suggests that it is a translation from the Latin (see below).The Latin broadsheet consists of a chart of the comet's path with dated positions against the background of the constellations hydra, crater and corvus, and a succinct Latin text of 23 lines. There is some truth to Kircher's characterization of his text as ""unpolished"" (see above), especially regarding the lack of a stylistically adorned introduction. Instead, the text startsin medias res:Sex potissimum conditiones in hoc noviter detecto cometa considerari possunt, situs, motus, forma, lumen, locus, caudae directio.(""Chiefly, there are six properties that can be examined in this recently detected comet: position [against the background of the constellations], movement, form, light, place [regarding the planetary orbits], and the direction of the comet tail."") Kircher reports on each of the six points in a couple of lines. At the end, he refrains from providing astrological interpretation of the comet.On the one hand, Kircher shares information in his broadsheet, on the other, he is implicitly asking for information from the other side of the Alps. In point 5, he states that the comet is supralunar, as it has been visible everywhere in Italy. The exact place of the comet, however, will become clearer once he receives observations from theultramontani, because it is necessary to know the parallax for that.The German broadsheet is very close to the Latin version. Only in the introduction and the ending on astrological interpretation, the German text departs a bit from the original text. In the first lines, the Latinin hoc noviter detecto cometais supplemented by information on the place and date (according to the Julian and Gregorian calendar) of the observation, resulting in: ""[b]ey diesem Cometen oder Schwantz-Stern / so neulicher Zeit als den 4/14 Decembris des vorigen Jahrs alhie zu Rom sich allererst sehen lassen"". In point 5,supra lunamis rendered as ""über dem Licht"" (""above the light""), perhaps because the translator misreadlunamaslumen.Duke Augustus was not the only one to receive Kircher's observation of the comet: Kircher had sent an almost identical report to his fellow JesuitAlbert von Curtz. Curtz passed the report on to Johann Ernst von Rautenstein in Regensburg, Rautenstein sent it,like other observations of the comet, toStanisław Lubienieckiin Hamburg, and Lubieniecki had it printed a few years later in his monumentalTheatrum cometicum(1668), pp.210–11. TheTheatrum cometicumalso includes a letter from 18 March 1665, in which Lubienecki tells Kircher that he owns a copy of his observation (iter summa cura a te observatum), but without the chart of the comet's path (p.747). In the same letter, Lubienecki informs Kircher about observations of the comet as seen from the other side of the Alps. Thus, Kircher's quest for data on the comet of 1664 from outside Italy was indeed successful.","Harms; Schilling 1985, no.

It is clear from the matching book titles that the texts are intimately linked. They also share the same protagonists, the human Theodidactus and the angel Cosmiel. While the topic ofEcstatic Journeyis the cosmos, the topic of its sequel is the earth (geocosmos). Both books consist of a series of dialogues, one of which tells the story of the eponymous journey: to the planets and stars in the first case, below the surface of the sea and the earth in the second case.TheSecond Ecstatic Journeyconsists of three dialogues. The short first dialogue serves as a prelude to the work: Theodidactus – still under the impressions of his journey through the universe – falls asleep in a garden and meets Hydriel (a new character), who teaches him about water and makes him eager to see what is belowground (p. 1–37). The second dialogue then features the return of Cosmiel, who talks to Theodidactus about the earth first (p. 38–125), before he guides him through the subterranean world in the third dialogue (p. 126–227). The order of theEcstatic Journey, which began with the voyage into the skies, is thus inverted.As in theEcstatic Journey, a first-person narrative from Theodidactus’s perspective introduces and supplements the direct dialogue. The literary style is florid, full of vivid, multi-sensory descriptions and emphatic outbursts about the wonders of the subterranean world.

The two short works may count as one: they were published together, are of the same make, and the second is anticipated at the end of the first, as the trip to Kent ends with the planning of the excursion to Hampsted Heath (p. 10).The reports, which are bare of any paratexts, are mostly given in the first person plural, as Johnson speaks on behalf of all his fellow apothecaries, and show a structure familiar from other botanizing reports and guides (cf. Francesco Calzori'sIter Baldi, for instance): a narrative of the trip itself, including the route taken, the circumstances encountered, and the experiences made, is regularly interrupted by lists of plants found and collected. The latter comprise some 360 kinds – mostly flowers and herbs – although Johnson takes care not to repeat himself. Their names are given as short polynomials likePimpinella sanguisorba minor(""Lesser styptic pimpinella"", p. 9); sometimes an indication of the name giver, such asMatt(ioli)orBauhini, is added. The habitats are usually indicated in general terms (on the way from A to B, in the fields at C), but Johnson can be more specific on occasion, as in the case of his very first 'plant' (p. 1), aLichen e diversorii muro avulsus(""lichen plucked from the wall of the inn"" [sc. at Gravesend]). The travelogue parts are written in casual and sometimes incorrect Latin – as an apothecary, Johnson presumably had not the best education in that language – but bristle with lively detail: a thunderstorm threatening the party on the Tames (described in mock-heroic fashion in the words ofAeneid1.88–91), the sight of the royal fleet near Gravesend (p. 4), a pastor's hospitality (p. 5), the splendors of a castle built by Edward III (p. 6), the torments of Tantalus experienced during a thirsty walk by the salty sea (p. 7), the variously prepared lamb (agnum diversimodo paratum, p. 10) consumed after the party's return to London, and so on. In sum, the excursions seem to have been pleasure trips in enjoyable company as much as botanical expeditions. At the end, however, it is the latter aspect that is emphasized: it has been his aim, Johnson declares, to celebrate the Company's toils and expenses in the name of botany (quantum in sumptibus, quantum in laboribus ad rei herbariae studium promovendum fuimus, p. 13). And this is only the beginning of greater things to come:Sed huius anni labores sunt tamquem praeludia aliis sequentibus annis exantlandis, quibus propitius sit Deus. Amen.Johnson kept his word. In 1632, 1634, and 1641, he published three similar, but more elaborated accounts of fieldtrips, which include not only simple lists, but long alphabetical catalogues of plants as well.

The protagonist is looking for answers about Descartes' doctrines and presented with opinions against and in favour of Cartesius concerning astronomical, cosmological, physical, biological, and medicinal questions, while he travels to the world of Descartes, which functions according to the laws expressed in his works. It begins with an instruction for the protagonist on the teachings of Cartesius, given by an anonymous scholar. The protagonist learns that the philosopher is not dead, as the world beliefs, but that he simply separated his soul from his body, and the former is residing somewhere in space. The work is clearly inspired by satirical works relating dream journeys, often entitledSomnium, famous examples being Justus Lipsius' and Petrus Nannius'Somnia. The author mentions another important, ancient model, Lucian, in his preface. The motive of the dream journey is, however, creatively adapted in this text, as the protagonist does not fall asleep and travel to themundus Cartesii, but inhales the vapour of a herb, which separates his mind from his body - perfectly in accordance with Cartesian thought - so that the former can depart on his journey, while the latter is staying behind. The elderly sage as well as the spirit of Cartesius' trusted friend Marin Mersenne are, then, his guides to an undefined space among the stars, where the philosopher himself resides, constructing his world according to his beliefs. Before reaching this world, they stop on the moon, the properties and regions of which are described in detail. There, they meet with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, as well as Pierre Gassendi and other anti-Cartesians. Then, they travel on and meet Descartes himself, who is curious about his standing in the scholarly world and disappointed that most of his works are still prohibited at certain universities.When describing the world of Descartes, the focus of attention is on his mechanistic opinions, concerning human and animal bodies, but also the world and cosmos. The author is especially ironical and critical towards the philosopher's vortex theory, which tried to explain the phenomenon of gravity, which was not yet discovered at the time. Descartes postulated innumerablevorticesswirling through the cosmos and producing the forces which moved the heavenly bodies. This is ridiculed harshly by Daniel. 
After his return from the journey, the protagonist, affected not only by his experiences, but also by the separation of his soul and body for a time, declares himself a Cartesian.The French novel was not only translated this once, but appeared in an English version in London in 1692, and a Latin version in Vienna in two parts in 1720 and 1721, which was ascribed to Ignatius Choler, but was actually a plagiarized version of the translation described here. Numerous mentions show that the work was widely read, especially among the Jesuit community.

It consists of two dialogues. The first dialogue tells the story of an exstatic voyage through the universe (p. 30–288). The protagonist is Theodidactus, a fictional character who is guided from planet to planet by the angel Cosmiel. Together, they visit the moon, Venus, Mercury, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and, finally, the sphere of the fixed stars. The voyage is presented as a first-person narrative from Theodidactus’s perspective, but for the most part, it takes the form of a direct dialogue, which is interspersed with first-person narration and description. In the second dialogue,De providentia Dei in mundi opificio elucescente(On the Providence of God Shining Forth in the Workmanship of the World), Theodidactus and Cosmiel discuss the cosmos in a more systematic way, without the narrative elements of the first dialogue. Expanding on the first dialogue, this ""essay in dialogue form"" (Glomski 2015, 228) is structured in chapters on topics like the creation of the world, its size, the order of the celestial bodies, or their distance to each other (p. 289–443).Cosmiel – quite literally the authority on the cosmos – acts as a teacher for Theodidactus, who still holds some outdated, Aristotelian views that need to be discarded. Through Cosmiel, Kircher advocates for the new astronomy, following the Tychonic model, describing the planets according to the telescopic obversations of the previous decades, and occasionally playing with heterodox ideas.In the preface, Kircher writes that he chose the form of a dialogue to discuss recent astronomical discoveries in an entertaining format. As the models for his allegorical tale, he cites Hermes Trismegistus, Plato, and Lucian, but in a more specific sense, he could also build on Neo-Latin literary traditions: in the wake of the first observations with the telescope, the fictional voyage through the stars had been used as a device to present a universe shaped by the new discoveries inJohannes Kepler'sSomniumandLibert Froidmont'sSomnium sive peregrinatio caelestis.Compared to these two earlier texts, theItinerarium exstaticumis much longer and more fleshed out. Kircher writes in a florid Baroque style, with vivid, multi-sensory descriptions of the planets: A good example is when Cosmiel and Theodidactus approach the planet Jupiter (p. 205–6): Theodidactus first marvels at the four moons which appear as a full moon, half moon, a gibbous moon, and sickle-shaped respectively and feels the strong current of the aether caused by the moons; he smells the refreshing scent of Jupiter, which is sweeter than amber and musk, sees the splendid light of the huge planet and, after landing on Jupiter's highest mountains, notes that Venus compares to Jupiter in size as a chicken egg compares to an ostrich egg. In addition, there are many emotional outbursts about the greatness of God’s creation throughout the dialogue.TheItinerarium exstaticumattracted the interest of readers and apparently sold out quickly, although it met with some criticism (cf.Siebert 2006, 25–44). In 1660, Kircher's work was reedited asIter extaticum caelesteby his studentKaspar Schottin Würzburg, with added introductions, commentaries and images. Schott's edition also included theIter extaticum II, Kircher's second work of fictional literature. In this format, the two travel dialogues were printed again in 1671. One of the readers of theIter extaticumwasChristiaan Huygens, who critisised it in the second book of his ownKosmotheoros.",Siebert 2006;Glomski 2013;Glomski 2015,"ΚΟΣΜΟΘΕΩΡΟΣ (Kosmotheoros)‎(← links)Kircher, Athanasius‎(← links)Iter extaticum II‎(← links)Dialogus inter terricolam et lunicolam‎(← links)Uranophilus caelestis peregrinus‎(← links)","Kircher, Athanasius:Itinerarium exstaticum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Itinerarium_exstaticum(last revision: 20.02.2023).","In Schott's preface (1660), he mentions that the book sold out and in consequence, not many copies made it to Germany; and that the text is based on a dream (which Kircher told Schott about), in which Kircher travelled to the planets under the guidance of his guardian angel.The objection against some Aristotelian ideas is made clear quite early in their voyage, after Theodidactus learned that the moon consisted of four elements like the earth (p. 54–5):Theodidactus.Scias, domine mi, me a puero multa in peripatetica schola de sphaera ignis inaudivisse, quam tamen nec supra nec infra lunam vidi, nec eam expertus sum: si enim alicubi ignea sphaera lateret, utique illam summo meo cruciatu in itineris nostri decursu sentissem.Cosmiel. Erras sane summopere, si Aristotelem de iis rebus, quae ad supremorum corporum naturam pertinent, omnia vera locutum esse tibi persuadeas; siquidem uti nihil eorum, quae tibi postea monstraturus sum, intellectu suo penetravit, ita mirum non est, si etiam circa sphaeram ignis hallucinatus sit.Theodidactus.You should know, my lord, that since childhood, I heard a lot in the peripatetic school about the sphere of fire, but I did not see it above or below the moon, nor did I experience it: for if there was a sphere of fire hidden somewhere, I would have felt it in excruciating pain on the descent of our journey.Cosmiel. You are utterly wrong, if you convince yourself that everything that Aristotle said about these things which concern the nature of the highest bodies, was right: for just as he did not penetrate with his mind any of the things which I am going to show you later, so it is no wonder if he also erred about the sphere of fire.",JL,Yes,IT,

Horrocks' manuscripts had circulated among numerous members of England's natural philosophical elite since the young man's death in 1641. They were first acquired by Horrocks' friend and co-observer of the famous 1639 transit of Venus, the Broughton merchant William Crabtree. From here they went to John Worthington of Emmanuel College, Cambrigde and later Samuel Hartlib, on whose generosity they began to circulate in Europe. Later still, founding fellow of the Royal Society Paul Neil acquired a copy of Horrocks'Venus in sole visawhich eventually made it to Hevelius in Gdánsk for publication.Wallis was working on his edition of Horrocks' work by 1665. This is made up principally of Horrocks' extended defence of Keplerian astronomy, which is entitled theAstronomia Kepleriana(pp. 1–239). This tract is made up, in turn, of sevendisputationes— which function here rather like books,libriin other contemporary works — on various aspects of Kepler's cosmology and its consequences. Each of thesedisputationesis divided into various chapters. There follow excerpts on topics of science from Horrocks' intensive epistolary exchange with Crabtree (241–338). These Wallis translated out of English into Latin, presumably for international consumption on the continent. The last section of work directly from Horrocks are his records from astronomical observation. First come those made from Toxteth (339–389) and then those from Much Hoole (390–403). The most important of this second group, Horrocks' observation and report on the 1639 transit of Venus, the first recorded, does not appear in the volume, as this work was intended to be published by John Flamsteed in a separate work. For whatever reason, this did not happen and Hevelius' remained the only early modern edition of the text.
The next section of Wallis' volume on Horrocks contains a copy of Crabtree’s available observations from the years surrounding Horrocks’ own astronomical activity (405–440). The next section of the work prints a dissertation of John Flamsteed's titldDe inaequalitate dierum solarium(441–464). The book's final section contains Flamsteed’s elaboration of new theory on the calculation of the moon’s position that Horrocks described to his friend Crabtree in a letter from 1638. These ideas were in turn described to William Gascoigne by Crabtree in a further letter of 1642. Flamsteed first reproduces Crabtree's version of Horrocks' theory for Gascoigne before expanding it himself into a series of tables and an explanatory note (467–496). Horrocks' theory described the vagaries of the moon’s movements so accurately that it was not improved until Mayer's lunar tables of 1753.",Applebaum 2012Wilson 1987,"Horrocks, Jeremiah‎(← links)Wallis, John‎(← links)Jeremiae Horrocii opera posthuma(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Horrocks, Jeremiah; Wallis, John:Jeremiae Horroccii opera posthuma, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Jeremiae_Horroccii_opera_posthuma(last revision: 20.11.2021).",,WB,Yes,WB,

In this engraving ofJohannes Kepler, however, the likeness too was found lacking. Kepler’s friendMatthias Berneggerhad sent the engraving to Wilhelm Schickard in Tübingen, who in turn gave it to Lansius so that he would write an epigram on it. However, neither Schickard nor Lansius thought the picture looked very much like Kepler (cf. Schickard's letter to Bernegger, 2nd May, 1621, no. 913 inCaspar 1959), and Lansius did not conceal this fact in his poem. In three elegiac couplets, he attacked the portrait for its lacking resemblance with Kepler:Keppleri quae nomen habet, cur peccat imago?Quae tanto errori causa subesse potest?Scilicet est terrae Keppleri regula cursus,per vim hic sculptoris traxerat erro manum.Terra utinam numquam currat semperque quiescat,quo sic Keppleri peccet imago minus!""Why is the image, which bears Kepler’s name, off the mark? What can be the cause for such a great error? It is the movement of the earth, Kepler’s rule: through its force, this planet had moved the hand of the engraver. If only the earth would never move and always rest, so that this way, Kepler’s image would be less off the mark!""Thus, the poem exploits the contemporary debate about a moving earth to comic effect in order to explain how the picture of Kepler turned out so bad – the mistake (error) is caused by the fact that the earth is a planet (erro). As the earth is moving and does not stand still, the hand of the engraver is not able to draw the picture perfectly (the moving earth is equated here to something like a moving chariot).Because of its curious combination of text and image, Schickard expected the portrait to find many buyers. One of them was Stephanus Lansius, a student in Tübingen, whosealbum amicorum(held in the Oberösterreichische Landesbibliothek) contains the engraving together with an autograph of Johannes Kepler.","Caspar 1959, no. 913 (Schickard's letter to Bernegger),Frank 1955(on Stephanus Lansius'salbum amicorum)","Lansius, Thomas‎(← links)","Lansius, Thomas:Keppleri quae nomen habet (author portrait), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Keppleri_quae_nomen_habet_(author_portrait)(last revision: 22.02.2022).",Case study in dissertation.,IT,,IT,

The work was sent to Prague to be printed in Europe for Stansel’s colleagues in the Old World. It is dedicated to the nobleman Ignaz Karl, Count Sternberg, whom the author addresses as patron and contains also an address to the “venerated European astronomers”. The main part is presented in two parts, the first about the comet of 1664, which Stansel had observed in December, from his residence in Salvador da Bahia, Brasil, where the author was stationed as a Jesuit missionary (pp. I-C). After a short introduction of how Stansel came to observe the comet of 1664, his observations and interpretations he made based on those are presented, structured neatly in chapters and sub-chapters (propositiones) of varying length. Five chapters illuminate in detail all data the author gathered in several observations over numerous days: I: apparent location, latitude, longitude, declination and movement of the comet; II: the variety of its motion; III: its location in the universe; IV: somecuriosathe author observed; V: length of the comet’s head and tail.The second part (Legatus uranicus II) presents similar observations and data about the comet of the comet of 1665 (pp. CI-CXX). This part is much shorter and only comprises two chapters, detailing the comet’s emergence, location, phases and disappearance (I) as well as a list of chronological observations about its longitude, latitude and declination (II).

This section, as well as the whole work, reflects the author’s deep patriotism and reverence for his birth country.The style of the report is varied: unsurprisingly, the dedication and letter to the European astronomers are lively show the author’s literary ambition. Similar in tone and style and quite engaging are sections, where Stansel narrates how he came to make his observations of the comets.

"Goldbach, Christian",[no title],,1730,,,18th century,Letter,Mathematics,"Letter to Euler, 20/31 July 1730",915096,"In 1727, Christian Goldbach andLeonhard Euler, based at Moscow and Saint Petersburg at the time, initiated a regular mathematical correspondence that lasted until Goldbach's death in 1764. Their epistolary exchange is to a small part in German with embedded passages in Latin, but mostly entirely in Latin. The letters constitute an open and lively discussion of both parties' current mathematical work. Each scientist presents results and conjectures of his own and comments on the contributions of his partner in previous letters. The correspondents jump without ado from one subject to the next, just as in a real ongoing conversation. The discussion is conducted in a stylistically casual, lexically highly technical Latin. The modi are used quite freely (in the present example cf., e.g.,haud satis intelligo, cur Fermatius affirmavit…, p. 33). Expressions likeinter se primi(""relatively prime""),approximatio(""approximation"") andnumerus trigonalis(""triangular number"") abound. The running text is interspersed with many equations and other formulaic expressions.The present letter constitutes a typical specimen of the correspondence as a whole. Goldbach first discusses Fermat numbers and confirms that they must all be relatively prime, as Euler had stated in an earlier letter (ut dicis). At the same time, he doubts that a proof of the conjecture that the Fermat numbers are all absolutely prime will be easy to find (in fact, the conjecture turned out to be false). Next, Goldbach candidly admits that a theorem found by him and debunked by Euler is indeed not true: The smallest divisor of a number equating a square plus one is not always itself a square plus one. How easily one can be mistaken about divisors makes him doubt Fermat's aforementioned conjecture even more. He then goes on to wonder if Fermat had an algorithm for the partition of any given number in four square numbers to prove his respective assumption (which is indeed true). Next, a numerical error in a previous letter is corrected and various methods to approximate π are discussed. Goldberg asks Euler to indicate further findings in this field to him, should any come to his knowledge. Regarding the proof of Goldberg's theorem that no triangular number except 1 is a fourth power, Euler may ask Daniel Bernoulli (also at Saint Petersburg at the time), to whom Goldberg has explained it in a letter. Finally, Goldberg gently teases Euler with a new problem: If only the last two digits of a number are given, how can one add another number to  it so that the result is in all cases no power whatsoever. This problem is so simple that Euler would scorn it, Goldbach says, if he would also give the method to find the respective number and the proof. He therefore postpones the solution until his next letter.The version given under ""Digital copy"" (where one has to follow the links ""Correspondence"" and ""Christian Goldbach"") is the one published by Euler's later secretary P.H. Fuss, from which all references to personal matters are excised. This is regrettable, but also shows that the publication practice that can be observed in theEpistolae ad Albertum Hallerumfrom the late 18th century continued far into the 19th.","Fuss 1843, 32–34","Goldbach, Christian‎(← links)","Goldbach, Christian:Letter to Euler, 20/31 July 1730, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Letter_to_Euler,_20/31_July_1730(last revision: 09.02.2022).","The letter is certainly also in the Goldbach correspondence in Euler'sOpera omnia, which are not at Innsbruck nor accessible online.",MK,Yes,MK,

Tuus omni officio.",,[1629],,,17th century,Letter,,"Letter to Mersenne, March 1629(Early Modern Letters Online)",not available,"For some time, the Dutch philosopher and scientist Isaac Beeckman and the French Minim Friar, scientist and networker Marin Mersenne apparently exchanged letters on a fairly regular basis. Twelve letters from Beeckman to Mersenne and two from Mersenne to Beeckman are known from the period 1626–1633. Some (but not the present one) can be found in volumes 2 and 3 of the modern edition of Mersenne's correspondence (De Waard et al. 1932–1988). Both men had strong acoustic and musicological interests, and the better part of their correspondence is dedicated to questions from this field. However, other scientific topics are not neglected either. The present letter by Beeckman, the second one in terms of chronology, is a typical specimen of this correspondence. Its friendly tone, the high scientific level, the frankness with which dissent is declared and discussed, the tacit agreement not to let religious matters (Beeckman was a Calvinist, Mersenne a catholic) interfere with such discussions, the casual way in which various topics are strung together and the clear and relaxed style all recur in most other letters.The epistle answers a previous one by Mersenne, lost today, in which the French clergyman had referred to their common acquaintance René Descartes and asked Beeckman about the reasons for the euphony of certain chords. Having addressed Mersenne in flattering terms (""most learned man"", ""splendid mathematician"") in the salutation, Beeckman begins with a paragraph in which he alludes to his question (unfortunately in rather vague terms), recalls an earlier exchange of ideas with Descartes about the respective subject and relates a recent visit of the philosopher. – He then takes issue with an assertion by Mersenne to be able to measure the exact frequency of a vibrating string (At miror, quo pacto dicas te posse in nervo testudinis numerum excursuum et recursuum in dato tempore assignare). Beeckman, who has always contented himself with determining the ratio (proportionem) between two frequencies, thinks such a measurement impossible for a number of reasons which he enumerates in some detail. A remark concerning the problems posed by the air drag to timekeeping with the help of a pendulum (a method initiated around 1600 by Galilei) leads to an aside about the free fall: Beeckmann (correctly) thinks that free falling bodies accelerate only up to a certain point due to the air resistance. He once has figured out a way of determining this point. – In a third and final section, Beeckman confronts his correspondent with a musicological riddle in turn: Why do church congregations always, everywhere and in the same way depart from the musical notation in singing certain psalms? To make clear his point, he even writes down a note example for Mersenne, ""since you are unacquainted with the psalms of the reformed church"" (cum psalmis reformatorum non assueveris). Beeckman concludes with a valediction and the request that Mersenne may inform him about any new discovery or invention he comes across in Paris.",,"Beeckman, Isaac‎(← links)","Beeckman, Isaac:Letter to Mersenne, March 1629, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Letter_to_Mersenne,_March_1629(last revision: 09.02.2022).",,MK,,MK,

That the author caters to various groups of readers also becomes evident from a comparison between the title page hand and the preface. The former promotes the work as useful for medical students and well-known doctors (tum medicinam addiscentibus, tum Paeoniae arti nomen dantibus), who will be helped in their understanding of difficult Galenic as well as iatrochemical writings (ad scripta tam Galenica quam chymica obscuriora facilius capessenda). The preface, by contrast, targets pharmacists, lamenting the sluggishness of bad representatives of the craft and explaining that good ones use to present their findings in deliberately obscure terminology taken from Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Latin, Turkish, Wallachian (Wallachio idiomate; meaning unclear, perhaps Welsh?) or German. By means of the present work, Müller von Löwenstein wants to aid his colleagues with the resulting problems.The lexicon itself falls in three parts of decreasing length. Part one (pp. 1–259) is a Latin-German dictionary of simples, most of them plants, a few minerals. In accordance with the preface, however, the Latin side covers everything occurring in a Latin text, regardless of the language from which a term is actually taken. Usually, many 'Latin' terms correspond to one German expression, which is why two or three columns are reserved for the Latin words. Unfortunately, this makes the lexicon quite difficult to search, and the respective problems are aggravated by the fact that in this as in the other parts, the alphabetisation usually extends to the first two letters only. Part two (pp. 260–295) is a German-Latin dictionary, which by and large deals with the the same simples but has a much plainer structure, because the number of Latin terms is greatly reduced.  The third and last part (pp. 295–312) is in Latin only and comprises four sections: a dictionary of diseases (pp. 295–304), one of medical measures and weights (pp. 304–307), a list of respective symbols and abbreviations (p. 307), and an intriguing catalogue of chymical symbols (pp. 308–312).Simultaneously with the edition discussed in the present entry, a German edition appeared at the same place and with the same publisher – another measure to maximize the prospective readership. However, the linguistic difference between the two editions only extends to the introductory paratexts. Otherwise, they are completely identical. The German version includes a dedication to the Estates of Lower Austria which is absent from its Latin counterpart. On its title page, pharmacists, who used to have less Latin than physicians, are highlighted as the main audience: the book is said to benefit ""Allen der Artzney Zugethanen / absonderlich denen Apotheckern"". The German preface is more prolix than the Latin one but spares the reader some learned allusions. A good example of the latter phenomenon can be found on its first page: The Latin text expresses the notion that not all so-called pharmacists are truly worthy of this name with the wordspauci Bacchi, sed multi thyrsigeri(""few are initiated to the Bacchic mysteries, but many bear the thyrsus"", after Plato,Phaedo69c). The German version by contrast says that ""nicht alle / die lange Messer tragen gute Köche seyn"" (""not all who have long knives are good cooks"").",,"Müller von Löwenstein, Friedrich‎(← links)","Müller von Löwenstein, Friedrich:Lexicon medico-galeno-chymico-pharmaceuticum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lexicon_medico-galeno-chymico-pharmaceuticum(last revision: 06.10.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Already in 1693, a new, apparently unchanged edition was produced, which is the subject of the present description. It is a rather bulky, but nonetheless handy little volume, comprising over 600 pages in what seems to be a sedecimo format.The lexicon is preceded by a letter of dedication to Nicolas-Joseph Foucault, a royal counsellor and high official in the Normandy, and by a note to the reader, which contains interesting, but somewhat mysterious information regarding the work's gestation and purpose: It is said to be the fruit of Callard de LaDucquerie's teaching at Caens, where his students asked him to give a lecture course on the etymology of medical terms (omnes communibus votis lexicon medicum etymologicum efflagitarunt). Later, the professor prepared the manuscript of this course for print, again at the instigation of the students. What lies behind this enthusiasm for medical etymology at Caen remains unclear. Did the students or Callard de LaDucquerie himself suppose that medical terminology is easier to remember if one knows from which words and notions the single expressions are derived? In any case, the resulting dictionary seems to be quite unique in this respect.After a Privilège du Roy (which provides the date of the first edition), the work itself comprises 372 pages. The c. 3000 lemmas, which are presented in alphabetical order, mostly concern anatomy, diseases,materia medica, and chymistry, but also plants and animals as such, clothing and other things hardly related to medicine. A typical entry gives the lemma word in italicized Latin letters, regardless of its Latin or Greek origin, followed by a transliteration in Greek letters in the case of Greek words. The etymology is formulaically introduced bya(""from""). Finally, the meaning is explained in a simple phrase commenced by or includingest(""is""). Sometimes, a French equivalent is given at the end. The entry on the plane tree (p. 274) may serve as an example:Platanus, πλάτανος, a πλατύς, latus. Arbor est late patens ramis et spatiosam faciens umbram. Gal. plane.Platanus, πλάτανος,  from πλατύς, ""broad"". It is a tree whose branches spread widely and create a vast shadow. French ""plane"".To the etymological dictionary, the author has added another, a little shorter one (239 pp.) lexicon of particularly difficult words (obscuriores voces), which is only briefly mentioned on the title page, but passed over in silence in the paratexts. Some 4000 hard expressions are listed and explained, but not etymologized.Whatever it was that attracted readers to this dictionary which looks quite strange to modern eyes, its success was not restricted to the first and second editions. It was issued twice more, without any substantial changes, in 1702 and 1724.",,"Callard de LaDucquerie, Jean Baptiste‎(← links)Lexicon medium etymologicum(redirect page) ‎(← links)Vocabulorum medicinalium epitoma‎(← links)","Callard de LaDucquerie, Jean Baptiste:Lexicon medicum etymologicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lexicon_medicum_etymologicum(last revision: 06.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

(The preface also is an interesting source regarding the problems arising for medical students from their lack of terminological knowledge in general.)

In these works, Latin and the vernaculars are combined in various ways (Haßler 1998, 323–24). Latin may be just one language among several others (as in Esteban de Terrero y Pando'sDiccionario Castellano con las voces de ciencias y artes y sus correspondientes en las tres lenguas Francesa, Latina y Italiana, 1786–93), but it can also be the description language and/or define the alphabetic order of the entries. The paratexts may be written in Latin or in a vernacular as well.The Hamburg polymath and travelogue author Philipp Andreas Nemnich was also a tireless lexicographer. Besides numerous dictionaries of economy and commerce, he published two scientific lexica as well. HisAllgemeines Polyglottenlexicon der Naturgeschichte(1793–98) is a multi-volume work whose description language is German but whose lemmata are ordered according to the respective Latin designations. In Nemnich's slim single-volumeLexicon nosologicum polyglotton(Multi-Language Lexicon of Diseases), the role of Latin is even more important. Not only does it take centre stage within the lemmata, the paratexts are in Latin as well. Admittedly, these paratexts are quite reduced: They only comprise a few title pages opening the lexicon as a whole and its several sections (see below) and two ellogia which dedicate the work to a professor of medicine at Marburg who suggested theutilissimum opus(""most useful work"") and to a Hamburg doctor and personal friend.In general, the work is very simply structured and easy to consult. It falls into ten sections. The first and most extensive one provides a list of Latin entries for diseases, their symptoms and various other medical phenomena, followed by one or several translations into German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. The very first entry reads:ABORTUS; AbortioGerm.Unzeitige niederkunft, Umschlag.Belg.Bisbaaring, Miskraam.Dan.Föridlig nedkomst, Omslag.Suec.Misfall.Angl.Miscarriage.Gall.Fausse-couche.Ital.Sconciatura.Hisp.Aborto, Mal parto.Lusit.Movito.The main lemmata such as this are interspersed with a greater number of smaller ones, which give purely (Greco-)Latin synonyms, such as ""E x o p h t h a l m i a. Oculorum procidentia"", or redirect the reader to other lemmata. In the remaining nine sections, medical terms from each of the vernaculars are translated into Latin. In this way, writers as well as readers of medical Latin are well served. (In earlier times, by contrast, medical lexica basically provided assistance for the perusal of the classics, and it was tacitly assumed that people would somehow learn to write medical Latin in this way as well.) However, the users of Nemnich's work must already possess some medical expertise, since the author refrains from giving any explanations in full sentences or even definitory circumlocutions.

At the end, there are a few pages of errata.The work is interesting in at least three respects.i. It is unusually comprehensive, not only because of its high number of entries, but also because of their disciplinary spread. Besides pharmaceutical objects and notions, zoological, botanical, mineralogical, (al)chemical and medical ones are covered as well. Moreover, terms in natural language are supplemented by symbols. The author has culled this vast material from a great number of scientific works, esp. from many earlier dictionaries. In the Latin-German lexicon, he regularly names his sources in the single entries.ii. Sommerhoff has produced a comparatively early example of a scientific lexicon that is truly bilingual and in which the relationship of the two languages is more or less symmetrical: Not only are terms from one language translated into another, the lemmata are also alphabetised according to Latinandthe vernacular, as already mentioned. The Latin-German part admittedly is more extensive than the German-Latin one, and in fact most of its entries are purely Latin without any German translation. On the other hand, however, even the paratexts are bilingual. Besides the abovementioned poems, the second lexicon has a German title page. Apparently, Sommerhoff was catering for readers (who would use the first part) and writers of pharmacological Latin (who would look up words in the second) alike. Perhaps he also wanted to reassure users with little Latin with the help of some additional vernacular material. In pharmacology, which was only at the fringe of academia in early modern times, such an approach was probably welcomed by many (see iii). On the other hand, chances that the book would sell beyond German speaking lands as well were much reduced in this way (although most of the first lexicon could in theory be used without any knowledge of German).iii. In the paratexts, it is declared that the book has been written for pharmaceutical apprentices  who have not mastered the technical nomenclature yet (Paeoniae artis filios, ""the sons of the art of Paian"", as Sommerhoff unctuously calls them in his Latin preface). That many future pharmacists had little Latin is credible. As mentioned in the letter to Sommerhoff,Ole Borchhad writtenan entire bookon the pronunciation of pharmacological Latin for beginners in 1670. Nonetheless, in view of the first lexicon it may be doubted that ignorant youngsters were indeed the primary readership. Perhaps Sommerhoff simply makes use of an understatement common in many scientific and scholarly publications, which are actually quite advanced but present themselves as preliminary and introductory.",,"Sommerhoff, Johann Christoph‎(← links)","Sommerhoff, Johann Christoph:Lexicon pharmaceutico-chymicum Latino-Germanicum et Germanico-Latinum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lexicon_pharmaceutico-chymicum_Latino-Germanicum_et_Germanico-Latinum(last revision: 06.10.2021).","On Borch's lexicon of pharmocological pronunciation:Postquam enim Borrichius observaverat artis pharmaceuticae tirones ut plurimum ob Latinae linguae ignorantiam in vocabulorum pronunciatione haesitare, librum 1670 in quarto in lucem misit, cui titulus: ""Lingua pharmacopaeorum sive de accurata vocabulorum in pharmacopoliis usitatorum pronunciatione"".Many names of plants and animals are already given in a proto-Linnean binomial nomenclature, i.e. subst. + adj.

The work is dedicated to Sebastianus Theodoricus, the rector of the University of Wittemberg as is stated in a letter addressed to him. Apart from this letter, there is a liminary poem byJoachim Camerariusin 27 hendecasyllabic verses, in which Camerarius states that he enjoyed reading Selnecker’s poem very much although he was very occupied with work at that time. He compares it to Eobanus Hessus's poetic abilities who is also directly invoked.The didactic poem itself is titledPhysiologia seu exposition septem rerum naturalium, ut medici vocant. It begins with a proem in which the poet invokes Apollo and Thalia, then addresses the reader, and in the end the dedicatee Sebastianus Theodoricus. Then follows a passage in which the title is explained: there are threeordinesof medicine: theordo rerum naturalium, i.e. the things that compose the body in a natural, correct, and healthy way, then there is theordo rerum non naturalium, i.e. things that can change the constitution of the body, and finally theordo rerum praeter/contra naturam, i.e. things that do harm to our body and often lead to death. The poet states that he only deals with the firstordo. As already indicated in the title, there are seven of theseres naturalesbelonging to theordo rerum naturalium. These are treated in as many chapters that are divided into subsections.
The first chapter (de quatuor elementis) introduces the four elements, the second (de temperamentis) the elementary qualities and mixtures of these qualities. The third chapter (de humoribus) treats the four humours and the respective characters and illnesses that derive from an unequal distribution of these humours in the body. Chapter four (de membris et partibus corporis) is the longest chapter and deals with anatomy. It starts with theprincipes partes corporis, the main parts of the body. The first part is the head with its different organs (e.g. brain, eyes, ears, nose), followed by the heart and its functions, lungs, trachea, tongue, internal organs of the abdomen, reproductive organs, and finally different tissues such as bones, nerves, skin, ligaments, flesh, etc.
The next chapter (de potentiis, virtutibus sive facultatibus, quae gubernant corpus nostrum) discusses the “physiology” of the human body (e.g. nutrition, reproduction, senses, locomotion), including emotions and mental abilities. The two last chapters are shorter and deal with conscious and unconscious acts (de actionibus, operationibus sive functionibus) as well as the so-calledspiritus(de spiritibus.) The poem ends with a shortconclusio. There are marginalia throughout the poem that provide technical terms in Latin and Greek. The poet often times invokes God as creator of the world and the human body and also offers some “guidance” in terms of morality, especially in the passages on reproduction.",,"Selnecker, Nikolaus‎(← links)","Selnecker, Nikolaus:Libellus de partibus corporis humani, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Libellus_de_partibus_corporis_humani(last revision: 28.06.2021).",,,Yes,DB,

In 1857 Italian historian of science Baldassarre Boncompagni published the oldest available version, a manuscript from 1225, together with Leonardo's other collected works.Leonardo, often known by the nameFibonacci, dedicated the book to Michael Scotus, who seems to have had an earlier version of the manuscript and recommended him to Frederick II. In a short autobiography he describes his journeys to Bugia (Bougie, Algeria) and how he learned ""the art of the nine Indian numerals from an extraordinary master"". Fibonacci travelled not only to northern Africa but also to Egypt, Byzantium, Sicily and the Provence where he was able to accumulate a lot of knowledge. But, he writes, all methods he learned were almost wrong (quasi errorem) compared to the way of Indian reckoning.The book is organized in 15 chapters (filling some 450 pages in Boncompagni's edition) which prove the comprehensive knowledge of Leonardo in the field of algebra and arithmetics. One can find four large parts of topics and contents:Part 1(chapters 1-7) presents the Hindu-Arabic numerals, basic calculations and fractions. The first chapter starts rightaway with the introduction of the ""nine Indian numerals"" and the sign ""0"" which the arabs callzephyrum, which are announced to be able to represent any number. Then the chapters on multiplication, addition, subtraction (extratione minorum numerorium de maioribus) and division follow. In the latter, Leonardo introduces fractions (‘’rupti’’) and other similarly written constructions, in particular a notion for ascending fractions he had learned from Arabic sources, (Vogel 1982). Later this method appears mostly in Italian writings with the exception ofWidmann’sAlgorithmus minutiarum vulgarium. The first part is concluded by two chapters on reckoning with fractions.Part 2(chapters 8-11) is concerned with practical problems of merchants like measure and currency conversions, calculation of profits, interest rates and questions how to fairly divide profits among several partners who had invested different sums in a business. In these chapters the notion for ascending fractions is used heavily in order to represent units and several subunits of various quantities (typically mass or price). This comes handy if many different mass and currency systems are used in parallel.Part 3(chapters 12 and 13) is the longest and contains a huge amount of word problems with long traditions from Greek antiquity, or that go back to Arabic, Hindu or even Chinese sources. Among the one finds problem of perfect numbers next to thefamous rabbit problemwhich results to the sequence, today known as the ""Fibonacci sequence"". There are a huge amount of different problems and solutions often tailored to the specific problem. Among them, there is the ""method"" of algebra (regulae rectae) and the method of double false position (often known asregula falsi, here it is calledregula elchatayn, a latinization of an Arabic expression). There are also problems which do not have a solution, unless - Fibonacci says - one accepts a ""debit"" as one. Such problems are calledunconveniens,insolubilis, orincongruum.Part 4(chapters 14 and 15) is the most theoretical one, contains references to Euclid, deals with the typical Arabic ""geometrical algebra"", proportions, the Pythagorean theorem and quadratic equations. Some of the names for variables and their powers are typical:res, radixfor the unknown,census,quadratusfor the square;numerusfor the constant. But also the later less usedpars(for another unknown),aver(for the square) anddenariusordragmaappear.Although Fibonacci's work was not the only one acquainting the Latin West with the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, it definitely played an important role in algebraic and arithmetical developments on the Italian peninsula until the appearance of Luca Pacioli andGirolamo Cardano.

By means of its presenteditio princepsunder the titleLiber completus in iudiciis astrorum(Exhaustive Book on the Judgments of the Stars), this encyclopaedic account of astrology became available to the Latin-speaking world. How the work was latinized and printed can more or less be reconstructed from some paratextual remarks in the edition itself. A kind of preface following directly upon theincipiton fol. 1r states that a man calledYhuda filius Musce(presumably Jehuda ben Moses Cohen, who also was involved in the gestation of theAlfonsine Tables) translated the work from Arabic into Castilian (hispanicum idioma). The Castilian version was latinized byAegidius de Tebaldis Parmensis, aulae imperialis notarius, una cum Petro de Regio, ipsius aulae protonotario. Like Jehuda, Aegidius and Petrus are known to have been attached to the court of Alfonso X. The body of the translation thus goes back to 13th century Spain. (Indeed, the text is attested in a number of late medieval manuscripts, for instanceCod. Guelf. 12.7 Aug. 2° from Wolfenbüttel.) Thesubscriptio(see Full title) claims that for the present edition the text was ""well revised and with true effort corrected by Bartholomaeus de Alten de Nusia, a German, a most excellent doctor of the arts and of medicine"". How far this revision went and if it entitles Bartholomaeus to co-authorship of the translation would require a thorough comparison of the edition with the extant manuscripts.The book is dedicated by the printer Erhard Ratdolt to Johann II von Werdenberg, bishop of Augsburg, whom he knows to be interested in astrology (siderali scientiae studiosum te non mediocriter noverim). The dedication is followed by a detailed table of contents, which is introduced by a short overview of the work's structure in running text and comprises more than five pages. On the last page, one finds the aforementionedsubscriptio. The work itself comprises 300 folio pages, printed in two columns in a blackletter font with numerous abbreviations. After some prefatory matter, which inter alia contains the above information about the work's authorship, the text itself falls into eight books, all of which are subdivided into chapters. Following an introductory explanation of some fundamentals (book 1, chs. 1–11), the first three books give an overview of the information to be gained from each of the twelve houses. Books 4–5 discuss natal astrology, that is, the construction of horoscopes. The subject of book 6 is the influences of the single planets during various timespans specifically allotted to them. Book 7 is dedicated to theelectiones, the most appropriate moments for various undertakings. In the last book, the individual approach taken so far is supplemented by an overview of mundane astrology.The translation is at times quite easy to read on account of its formulaic syntax. In particular, one often finds long strings of sentences beginning withet si …formulating an astrological condition, whose effect is then detailed in the apodosis. On the other hand, some aspects of the Latin cause difficulties. A number of technical terms likealcelcadeny(explained asdominus anni, ""lord of the year"", fol. 95r),algebutar, orhylechare taken over from the Arabic originial. The language also is unclassical in terms of non-technical vocabulary (e.g.uxorari, ""to marry"";prolongare, ""to extend""), syntax (suusinstead ofeius, indicative in indirect questions), and idiomacy. Some of the respective peculiarities go beyond the standard characteristics of late medieval Latin and seem to indicate that the Arabic original and the Castilian intermediary were translated very literally. A particularly conspicuous trait is the frequent replacement ofdebyinwhich is in evidence already in the title.TheLiber completusproved fairly successful.

Such textbooks made it possible to select from Aristotle's contents, to add new material and to gear the treatment to specific audiences and circumstances. Melanchthon, thepraeceptor Germaniae, was among the first important textbook authors (cf. hisInitia doctrinae physicae).TheLiber de anima(""Book about the Soul""), which builds on Aristotle's homonymous work, was first published in 1540 in Strasboug under the slightly different titleCommentarius de anima. The edition Wittenberg 1553, on which the present description is based, has been thoroughly revised by the author in the light of the findings documented in VesaliusDe humani corporis fabrica(cf. the title'srecognitus ab auctore Ph. M.;Eckart 1998, 195–198). The Wittenberg edition is dedicated to Hieronymus Baumgartner the younger.In terms of form, the work's c. 350 octavo pages are divided into unnumbered chapters of convenient length (a few pages each), whose titles often formulate a question. TheBook on the Soultherefore reminds one somewhat of a catechism without being one in the strict sense of the word. The high number of terms and quotations given in Greek presumably indicates that Melanchthon presupposed his students to have some knowledge of this language and wanted to incite them to learn more.With regard to content, Melanchthon supplements the Aristotelian theory of the soul with the respective Christian notions:Recito autem doctrinam in academiis usitatam et confero Ecclesiae sententias, as he puts it in the dedication (fol. A4r). The most interesting feature, however, is the ample space dedicated not to the soul itself, but to the body which it inhabits. A long section on the human body and its various parts is inserted at fol. 14v–83r, and anatomical and medical issues play an important role throughout the work. The dedication justifies this procedure with the argument that the close relationship between body and soul implies that a proper understanding of the latter cannot be gained without some knowledge of the former. As his sources, Melanchthon mentions not only Galen, but also the modern writers Leonhart Fuchs and Andreas Vesalius as well as his personal friends Jacob Milich and Caspar Peucer (fol. A5r; on the help he got from physicians,Eckart 1998, 192). Moreover, an elegy of some 120 lines by Johann Stigel, which follows the dedication and is titledDe utilitate doctrinae de fabricatione humani corporis, also emphasizes how important a good understanding of the human body is. TheLiber de animathereby becomes an early example of the tendency of philosophical textbooks to integrate modern science in the traditional Aristotelian framework, a trend which became more and more pronounced over time (Schmitt 1988, 802–803).Melanchthon's textbook on the soul was a great success. It was reprinted until the end of the 16th century, commented upon, and rewritten in the form of tables. In protestant universities like Wittenberg, Jena, or Greifswald, it became the subject of classes at the arts faculty and even at the medical faculty, where professors used it as a propaedeutics to anatomy (Helm 1997, 189–190).The digital copy of the edition Wittenberg 1553 seems to illustrate a student's initial enthusiasm for the subject as well as its quick slacking off. While the first six or seven pages are overcrowded with notes, less and less annotations can be found later on. Nonetheless, theLiber de animawas a bestseller for several decades. It was prescribed as textbook at several protestant universities (Eckart 1998, 199) and reprinted nearly thirty times between 1553 and 1595.","Schmitt 1988, 797–798Helm 1997Eckart 1998, 192–199","Melanchthon, Philipp‎(← links)Bretschneider 1846‎(← links)","Melanchthon, Philipp:Liber de anima, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Liber_de_anima(last revision: 09.08.2021).",A4vExistimo ad academiarum consuetudinem recte institutam esse formam huius operis…,MK,Yes,MK,

Editus opera Ioannis Thomae Freigii, una cum eiusdem praefatione",,1578,Basel,Henricpetri,16th century,"Monograph, Tables and charts, Compendia","Mathematics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography, Geography/Cartography, Other (see description)",Liber de epochis(MDZ)Alternativ link:Google Books,731627,"In the course of the 16th century, a philological and an astronomical strand of historical chronology, both of which had been inherited from antiquity and the Middle Ages, merged. The combination of a humanist and a natural scientific approach greatly furthered the development of the discipline at large (Grafton 1991, esp. 129–31). One prominent exponent of this momentous trend was the Lutheran theologian, mathematician and historian Paul Crusius. However, his contribution to the subject, theLiber de epochis, appeared only posthumously, six years after his demise and presumably more than eleven years after its composition (on p. 5, Crusius speeks of a partial eclipse of 28 March 1567 – presumably the one of 9 April 1567greg – as something still in the future).The work is preceded by an instructive preface by its editor, the philosopher and jurist Johann Thomas Freigius: To achieve historical knowledge, one needs expertise in geography on the one hand and chronology on the other. These are the left and the right eye respectively of history, so to speak. Of special importance in chronology is the doctrine of the epochs (epochae). Epochs are important events in world history, whose dates provide a solid fundament for historical chronology at large, if they can be ascertained precisely. Crusius's book, which has reached Freigius via a friend, provides the best available overview of the subject.By way of introduction, Crusius fixes the date of the crucifixion, the most important epoch of all (pp. 1–7). After that, he divides his short treatise (150 octavo pages) in two parts devoted to ""astronomical"" (pp. 8–80) and ""ecclesiastical"" (pp. 80–150) epochs respectively. The former are ascertainable only with the help of astronomical data, while the latter can be computed on the basis of historical, non-astronomical sources. All in all, some thirty epochs are discussed. The first astronomical epochs are those which can be derived from Ptolemy, while the ecclesiastical epochs start from the creation of the world (orbis conditi).Crusius performs no astronomical calculations himself, but relies on data given inPtolemy, al-Battani,Copernicus, the Alfonsine and thePrutenic Tablesand other sources. He is familiar not only (of course) with the computus, but also with several ancient calendars, and he reads Hebrew and Arabic. His book is characterised by a reader-friendly style and a certain didacticism (although there is no hint that he used it as a textbooksensu strictoin his mathematical courses at the University of Jena). For instance, Crusius explains that he introduces the termsepochae astronomicaeandepochae ecclesiasticae""for the sake of teaching"" (docendi gratia, p. 7). Occasionally, general assertions are clarified by means of sample calculations. Crusius also provides simple recipes for the conversion of dates of one calendar into another, for example from the Islamic to the Julian calendar (pp. 42–43):Duplum annorum Alhigera divide per annos 67, quod provenit, subtrahe ab annis Alhigera propositis, et relinquentur his congruentes anni Iuliani.(""Divide twice the years of the Hijra by 67 years, subtract the result from the years of the Hijra, and the remainder will be the corresponding Julian years."") Some data sets (for instance, the Passover dates for the years around the time of the crucifixion, between pp. 4 and 5) are presented in the form of charts. Sources and subheadings are indicatedin margine. The language is simple, the train of thought clear, the exposition lucid.The work should originally have been followed by a treatise on synchronisms (p. 149; cf. also the subdivision of the field of chronology into epochs synchronisms in Freigius' introduction), but this treatise never appeared. Nonetheless, theLiber de epochisapparently exerted a decisive influence onJoseph Scaligerand suggested to him the composition of books 5–6 of hisDe emendatione temporum(1583) in the form in which we now have them (Grafton 1991, 131–33). In fact, Crusius was prior to Scaliger in recognizing the significance of (mostly lunar) eclipses for establishing a reliable chronology, havingApian'slist of lunar eclipses in hisAstronomicum Caesareum(1540) already at his disposal. Picking the ""right"" eclipse, however, needed a careful reading of the sources and a vast knowledge of calendars and their peculiarities. While Scaliger'sDe emendatione temporumturned out to be the more influential work, theLiber de epochisrepresents the true pioneering work in technical chronology.","Grafton 1983–1993, vol. 2, 109–139Nothaft 2012, 267–68","Crusius, Paul‎(← links)De emendatione temporum‎(← links)","Crusius, Paul:Liber de epochis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Liber_de_epochis(last revision: 06.02.2022).","The book is short and handy, but it seems to contain much proper research done by the author.",MK,Yes,MK,

Better than on the title page, the book's contents are described in a second, fuller version of the title on page 3, which readsDe libris propriis eorumque ordine et usu ac de mirabilibus operibus in arte medica per ipsum factis(""On His Own Books, Their Order and Use, and on the Wonderful Successes Achieved be Him in the Medical Art""). In fact, after an introductory address to the dedicatee, in which Cardano styles the book as a kind of defense against his many detractors (pp. 3–8), the work falls into two parts, one mainly bibliographical, the other biographical.Part one (pp. 8–87) lists, numbers and characterises fifty works written by Cardano up to 1554, when the manuscript was finished (p. 191), inserting them into a rudimentary account of the author's life in chronological order. Although Cardano invokes prestigious predecessors, namely Galen and Erasmus, for what he is doing, the points discussed for most works (e.g. title, incipit, length, contents, usefulness, intended readership) are chiefly inspired by the medievalaccessus ad auctores(Maclean 2004, 13–16). Published and unpublished works are enumerated alongside abandoned projects. The reader witnesses Cardano at work, incessantly drafting, writing, rewriting and incorporating works into one another. Thefata libellorumare sometimes convoluted and occasionally comical, as in the case of work no. 9 (p. 13), on which Cardano notes:Alium de pituita inchoavi, cui coniunctum fuit opus de re venerea; sed ambo hi libri corrupti sunt urina felis(""I began another book on saliva, to which was linked a work on sex; but both books were destroyed by cat's piss""). For important works such as theLiber de fato(pp. 14–21), a table of contents is given. Towards the end of this first part, Cardano'sopera omniaso far are summarised in a catalogue (pp. 80–82) and distributed into fiveclasses(mathematics, natural history, medicine, ethics andextra ordinem, i.e. not attributable) in another (pp. 84–86).The second part, which is not clearly separated from the first one, but may be said to comprise pages 87–191 (followed by a handful of additions and insertions on pp. 191–192), is a kind of justification of Cardano's way of life:Propositum enim nobis ab initio fuerat rationem nostri instituti reddere, as he puts it on page 116. The core of this part comprises Cardano's miraculous healings of forsaken patients, which are listed and numbered in the same way as the books (pp. 121–48). This section is followed  by brilliant forecasts of the course of illnesses, social successes and other topics.How far this book was written and published for clear-cut strategical reasons and how far it just expresses Cardano's idiosyncratic personality is hard to tell (cf.Maclean 2004, 22–23). At the beginning (pp. 7–8), the author anticipates that he may be perceived as vainglorious, and the modern reader indeed gets this impression from his self-depiction as a tireless genius, inspired by a personalnumen, who constantly stuns his patients and fellow doctors by his miraculous abilities. On the other hand, by posing as a victim of envy and slander, Cardano smartly justifies his self-praise, and theLiber de libris propriismay have considerably inhanced his fame among the members of the Europeanres publica litteraria. The work could have inspiredConrad Gessner'sDe libris a se editis epistola(written 1562, published 1566). Over one hundred years later, this and two other versions of Cardano's autobibliography followedDe propria vitaas an introduction to hisOpera omnia(1663).",Maclean 2004,"Cardano, Girolamo‎(← links)De libris a se editis epistola‎(← links)","Cardano, Girolamo:Liber de libris propriis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Liber_de_libris_propriis(last revision: 18.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It was written by Cardano towards the end of his life, but published only a hundred years later. It has won fame as the first text to explain the fundamentals of probability calculation and combinatorics. Probability is introduced as the ratio of favourable to possible cases (which is later called the ""classical definition of probability"" and attributed to Laplace) and the law of large numbers is formulated for the first time. The probability that an event will happenntimes in a row is correctly determined as the n-th power of the probability of that event (implicitly assuming independent trials).All considerations are based on questions of gambling, especially of dice and card games, something Cardano had great experience with as a professional and compulsive gambler. This experience also manifests itself in the fact that gambling not just a pretense for pure mathematics in the ""Liber de ludo aleae"" – quite the contrary. While most of the strictly speaking mathematical aspects are discussed in chs. 11–16, the rest of the work deals with a broad gamut of other gambling-related topics.  For example, the reader learns much about the technical and historical aspects, the morals, sociology and psychology of gambling (e.g., chs. 3–6, 8, 10, 21, 29–31).Although this is considered to be one of the first mathematical texts on probability, its publication came after the influential correspondence ofFermatand Pascal, which is usually defined as the birth of the mathematical field of probability theory.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 3, 66Tamborini 2006","Ars coniectandi‎(← links)Cardano, Girolamo‎(← links)De ratiociniis in ludo aleae‎(← links)","Cardano, Girolamo:Liber de ludo aleae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Liber_de_ludo_aleae(last revision: 02.12.2021).",,WB,Yes,"WB, FB",

In fact, the work was already published as a self-dependent volume before its inclusion into theNova Actaof the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.The text starts from a prefatory section (pp. 103–115) in which the author highlights the importance of studying each single species when dealing with species-poor regions, comments on the current state of lichenology, which is marked by much disagreement (unsurprisingly so, given the complexity of lichens, symbiotic organisms made up of algae and fungi), and explains his methods of research and presentation (treatment of genera, species, and varieties, handling of synonyms, character of diagnoses, botanical collections used). This is followed by a more specific introduction to the subject of lichens in the north (pp. 116–122), dedicated to the difficult demarcation of the arctic region and the peculiarities of its lichen flora (occurrence en masse, specific species, species occurring in certain habitats only) and concluded by a personal declaration of the author's love of the north. In the main part (pp. 123–390), Fries lists and describes 97 numerated genera of lichens. Each genus along with its species is discussed on a couple of pages. First, the genus itself is described, and general questions such as its status as a genus are discussed, taking into account the pertinent literature. Then, the single species are tackled: their appearance is described, current synonyms are given, their spread and habitat is sketched, and it is explained how they can be distinguished from similar species. In some cases, pertinent research questions, for instance, the respective species' generic affiliation, are discussed, and the reproductive organs and spores are described with the help of a microscope. The work is concluded by an index listing all names of the genera and species discussed (pp. 391–398). There are no images, a deficiency perhaps due to the sheer difficulty of producing telling depictions of lichens.There probably are few Latin works featuring such stark stylistic contrasts as the present one.  The introductory parts are written in classical periods and at least partly in a version of the high style (genus grande) infused with 19th century Romanticism. The stubborn existence of lichens in the hostile environment of the polar regions, for instance, is described in lofty terms as a battle between life and death (p. 104):Grave certamen ubi pugnatur, quis est spectantium, quin defixis oculis intentoque animo attonitus adstet? Cum inter mortem ipsam et vitam, vivam naturam et materiam mortuam sive elementis saevientibus obnoxiam, seditiosam, turbulentam certatur pugna, nonne pari modo necesse est fiat?Where a momentous battle is fought out, who among the viewers does not stand nearby like spellbound with his eyes glued and his mind focussed on it? When a battle is fought out between death itself and life, living nature and matter that is dead or exposed to the raging elements, rebellious and frenzied, is it not inevitable that the same should happen?On the other hand, the descriptive main part is extremely technical, testifying to the development of botanical Latin into an idiom sui generis in the post-Linnean period, much reduced syntactically but supremely rich in its terminology and quite opaque to outsiders (Stearn 1992). Pannaria rubiginosa, for instance, is described as follows (p. 172):Thallo membranaceo, suborbiculari, livido-glauco, ambitu laciniato-multifido, hypothallo indeterminato, spongioso, coeruleo-nigricanti; apotheciis subplanis, rubrofuscis, margine thallode incurvato crenato.Of parchmentlike, nearly circular, greyish-blue-green thallus with ragged, much-cleft margin and formless, spongy, dark blue-blackish hypothallus; of nearly plane, reddish-dark fruiting bodies with a thallus-like, bent, crenate margin.That the style and terminology of such descriptions persist to the present day despite the demise of Latin in botany may be seen froma modern description of the same species.About a decade after the present publication, the author, who had become a recognized luminary in the meantime, integrated its contents into his opus magnum, theLichenographia Scandinavica(1871–74).",,"Fries, Theodor Magnus‎(← links)","Fries, Theodor Magnus:Lichenes arctoi Europae Groenlandiaeque, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lichenes_arctoi_Europae_Groenlandiaeque(last revision: 21.04.2021).","motto from Linnaeus commending study of lichensWhat does the abbr.

Both interests appear combined in hisLanguage of the Pharmacists or On the Correct Pronunciation of the Words Commonly Used in Pharmacies, a lexicon published in 1670 with a dedication to Christian V of Denmark, whose personal doctor Borch was, and an approbation by his old teacher and friend Rasmus Bartholin.In his quite extended preface to the reader, Borch explains that the work was prompted by some meetings of pharmacists and physicians in Copenhagen, where, besides more important issues, questions of pronunciation were also discussed. As he goes on to explain, the main problem in this respect is the quantity and the stress of the next-to-last syllable, the so-calledpenultima. According to the rules of the Latin language, this syllable is stressed if it is long, otherwise, the third from last syllable is stressed instead. The application of this principle to loanwords from other languages such as Greek and Arabic poses some tricky problems.The lexicon is fully alphabetised and comprises a little over 80 quarto pages and 400 entries. In most cases, the only aspect discussed is the one mentioned in the introduction, viz., the quantity and stress of thepenultima. If possible, the quantity is illustrated by an example from poetry. Expressions of Greek origin are also quoted in their original form, because the Greek alphabet distinguishes some long and short vowels written with the same character in the Latin alphabet. Arguments from analogy with other, better known Latin words are common as well. Nothing is said about the meaning of a given term. The modest number of entries is due to the fact that only difficult cases are discussed, while bisyllabic words and words whosepenultimais marked as long by a diphthong or a cluster of consonants are left out. Moreover, several similar cases are often enumerated under one single heading. For this reason, theaentries are the most extensive, while later ones tend to become progressively shorter. A typical short entry reads (nontrivial abbreviations expanded; some additions in square brackets):Sinapi, penult(ima) prod(ucitur), quia Dioscoridi l. 2 c. 184 σίνηπι: Seque lacessenti fletum factura sinapis.

Columell(a), b. 10: ""and thesinapis[scanned u – u] which makes the one who grinds it weep."" Vindicianus [a late antique medical writer], l. 37 has wrongly shortened the next-to-last [syllable].It is not surprising that pharmacists, many of whom had no academic background, were sometimes baffled and embarassed by pronunciation problems. Similar difficulties are common in present-day science and scholarship as well. What is astonishing from a modern point of view is that the matter was taken so seriously that a leading 17th century scientist could devote a separate book to it. This is a telling indication how deeply early modern science was embedded in a humanist and antiquarian background.",,"Lexicon pharmaceutico-chymicum Latino-Germanicum et Germanico-Latinum‎(← links)Borch, Ole‎(← links)","Borch, Ole:Lingua pharmacopoeorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lingua_pharmacopoeorum(last revision: 06.10.2021).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

In the latter, Winther excuses possible lacunae in his work with his insufficient sources, explains that the book has cost him ten years to write, promises a similar work on Danish medicine and science (presumably theBibliotheca Danorum medica, 1832) and expresses his thanks to several friends and colleagues for their help. The ensuing table of contents runs to six pages. The work concludes with anIndex auctorumand four pages ofcorrigenda.In the body of the book, the Danish literature on natural history (for this is the de facto meaning of the title'sscientiae rerum naturalium) is presented on 233 octavo pages. It basically falls into three parts listing works of a general nature (pp. 1–32), zoological (pp. 33–146), and botanical works (pp. 147–233) respectively. The criterion of inclusion is not the content, but the place of publication of the respective works. Self-contained books are enumerated alongside articles in periodicals. The most common language of the works enumerated is Danish, followed by Latin and German.For the rest, theHandbookis most notable for three things: the disjointed, strangly punctuated, often hardly understandable Latin of its introductory parts (an example is appended below); the confusing structure of the bibliography proper (which becomes evident as soon as one tries to distinguish the different levels of classification in the table of contents); and the high number of typos.APPENDIX: A PARAGRAPH FROM THE FIRST PAGE OF THEPRAEMONENDASi quae omissa deprehenderit literaturae gnarus – id quod Norvegicam et Holsaticam qvae attinent – accidisse possibile est – monere liceat, in me volente non esse qvaerendam hujus omissionis causam, tribui vero, debere cognoscendi fontibus ex qvibus hauriendi fuit materia qvaeqve minus suppeditarunt – (ex parte, quae generosissimo J.

In the slender work of 96 pages, Beringer discussed the origin of figured stones in the light of the excavation of about two hundred spectacular figured stones in Würzburg, which featured – in a quite simple relievo – not only various plants and animals, but also suns, moons, stars, comets, and even the name of god in Hebrew letters: theLithographia Wirceburgensisis famous in the history of science because the figured stones of Würzburg turned out to be fakes (the so-called ""Würzburger Lügensteine""). Indeed, in his dissertation, Beringer already claims that these particular figured stones might be works of art and argues for their natural origin instead.TheLithographiawas printed as a dissertation, which was a convenient form of publication for early modern university professors because the respondent had to pay for the print. Consequently, Beringer's work is surrounded by a dedication letter by the respondent Georg Ludwig Hueber to the prince-bishop of Würzburg Christoph Franz von Hutten at the beginning and Hueber's 50 medical corollaries at the end. A second edition of 1767 removed those characteristic elements of the dissertation and altered the title page so that it mentioned only Beringer as the author.Beringer'sLithographiaitself is neatly structured into a proem and 14 short chapters. 21 images present the various plants, animals, and other incredible things which were carved into the stones. The first seven images are inserted into the text to support Beringer's argument, while the remaining fourteen follow at the end of the dissertation. 14 chapter headings in larger font provide a summary of the content of each chapter and make the book easily navigable for the reader. The proem is interesting as it constructs a complementarity between the investigators of the heavens and the investigators of the earth, which are equally delightful and useful, especially as they both reveal god's greatness, which is the main purpose of the natural science (scientia naturalis). The author goes on to praise thelithologiand their object of study, the figured stones, which had been found in all German parts except Franconia, an otherwise blessed region; now, however, the richest and perhaps most delightful treasure of figured stones in Germany has been discovered there (the focus on the natural wealth and glory of the region places Beringer's text in the literary tradition of regional mineralogies, cf.Cooper 2007, 101–9).The panegyric proemium is informed by a grand rhetorical style and full of rhetorical figures like alliterations, anaphoras, parallelisms, chiasms and many more. Exuberant enumerations of things to be seen on the figured stones of Würzburg (close to fifty different animals, plants, or other things), some of which are elaborated into mini-descriptions, add to the vividness of the text (p. 7). Rhetoricised, long periods also pervade the 14 following chapters, and rhetorical figures are used as a means to persuade the reader (e.g. the rhetorical questions, combined with anaphoras on p. 63). At the end of the book, Beringer promises a subsequent edition with more images, better order and new and very rare stones of exotic figures. However, this edition was never realised, after the stones were proven to be a prank by colleagues of the professor. Perhaps it is due to the dubious state of the figured stones already at the time of the first print that Beringer lets his dissertation end with the wordveritas, ""truth"" (ut dissertatio tum prima, tum altera amica sit sine felle et aloe inquisitio veritatis, p. 96).","Jahn; Woolf 1963(English translation and commentary);Cooper 2007, 101–9","De crocodilo in lapide scissili expresso‎(← links)Beringer, Johann Bartholomäus Adam‎(← links)","Beringer, Johann Bartholomäus Adam; Hueber, Georg Ludwig:Lithographia Wirceburgensis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lithographia_Wirceburgensis(last revision: 20.11.2021).","Ch. 1 might be another interesting vindication of lithology.The order of the dedication letter in the digital copy is as follows: p. 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, 5, 9","WB, MK, JL",Yes,IT,

They are presented using anatomical termini, but also paraphrasing them or choosing other, more poetic words. The description is full of rhetorical flourish: pathos, rhetorical questions, figures of speech and more. The different poems imitate ancient works in form and style: The hexametrical poems show language and motifs from epic poetry and mythological exaltation; the Catullan ode treats the subject of the ears and the sense of hearing in a much more playful way; the elegies are full of pathos and grandiloquence. At the same time, the poet makes sure to display a wealth of up-to-date anatomical knowledge about the human body parts described.","Hofmann 2003, p. 346.","Nodari, Antonio‎(← links)","Nodari, Antonio:Lusus poeticus anatomicus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Lusus_poeticus_anatomicus(last revision: 18.08.2021).",,JL,Yes,JL,

Part two is about acoustics in an equally broad sense as in the case of optics in part I. Schott deals with the anatomy of the human ear and the organs producing sound, the propagation of sound, voices of animals, the echo, healing through sounds, music and harmonics, etc.
Part three deals with “mathematics”. In it Schott discusses gravitation, mechanics, scales, hydrostatics,aerotechnicaas well as arithmetic and geometry.
In the last part, Schott presents “physical” subjects. To him, these are topics like invisible inks and cryptography, pyrotechnics, magnetic phenomena, certain medical treatments, divination, and palmistry.Each part contains a detailed table of content in the beginning.

The neologismGalenico-chymicusdeclares that the author does not take sides in the controversy between traditional physicians and Paracelsians and that his book caters to both groups. As indicated by the last sentence of the full title, medical laymen looking for a guide to self-treatment are targeted as well.TheHandbookis introduced by a dedication to the authorities of Gdańsk, eight laudatory epigrams by friends and colleagues, in which the work's brevity is singled out for special praise (e.g.sic artem longam tu facis esse brevem, end of third poem), and a letter to the reader. In the last, the author explains that his book originated from a collection of notes for his personal use (first page:mihi potius ipsi scripserim et annotaverim), that he only presents a small selection of time-tested and commonly accepted drugs, and that the reader has to use his own expertise to apply them correctly.The single drugs are assigned to 13 sections devoted to different body parts and arrangeda capite ad calcem. Each of them is subdivided into simple and composite, warming and cooling, externally and internally applicable medications. Simples are further classified according to parts of plants, composite medications are subdivided into various types such as juices, syrups, oils, or pills. Under each of the resulting headings, the respective drugs – up to two dozen or so – are enumerated in the form of a simple list.

The lectures of Isaac Barrow, the first holder of the Lucasian chair of mathematics, are an early exception, although even in this case the initiative was not taken by the professor himself, but by his pupils (one of whom wasIsaac Newton).While Barrow's optical and geometrical lectures were published soon after they had been delivered, the present series of introductory lectures to mathematics for freshmen, six from the academic year 1663/64 and two from the following (see p. 111), appeared posthumously in 1683. After a longOratio praefatoria, there follow eight lectures, each of which comprises some 20 pages. They do not deal with mathematics strictly speaking and hardly contain any formulas, calculations and diagrams, but are dedicated to the theory of mathematics instead. The account starts from the expression ""mathematics"" and the discipline's subject (I), proceeds to its subdivision (II), more specifically to the relationship between geometry and arithmetics (III), discusses the nature, power and certainty of the mathematical proof (IV–VI) and concludes with an overview of the principles of mathematical reasoning (VII–VIII).
The presentation of mathematics follow very traditional lines. For example, in his chapter on the relationship of geometry and algebra, the new analytic geometry is not really acknowledged and the fusion of the traditionally separated fields almost denied.Although Barrow repeatedly protests his inability as a speaker (e.g. p.  111), his exposition features an appealing mix of rhetorical polish, learning and didacticism. His numerous Greek quotations (esp. from Aristotle) not only serve his argument but also showcase his erudition and flatter his audience by presuming theirs to be similar. Barrow takes great care to keep his listeners and readers oriented about the progress of his reasoning by way of transitions such as the following:Nunc ἀνασκευαστικῶς agendi partes obveniunt incumbitque nobis τὸ ἐξ ἐναντίας, mathematici ratiocinii certitudinem et praestantiam impugnantium impetus sustinere, captionibus occurrere, tricas expedire.

Let's get started"", p. 75). This is particularly evident at the beginning and in the conclusion of alectio, which regularly contain a reminder of the preceding talk and a preview of the following one respectively. Sometimes, the entire subject matter covered so far is recapitulated (e.g. p. 112). Occasionally, Barrow addresses his listeners directly, for example in order to anticipate their reactions and state of mind. In doing so, he usually comes across as very modest:Sed vereor, ne collationis huius prolixius et crassius institutae pigere vos incipiat(""But I am afraid that this discussion has been too garrulous and not subtle enough: it may begin to annoy you"", p. 74).TheLectiones mathematicaeare the first of a three-part series of Lucasian lectures.

Faulhaber presents instruments for surveying and metrology and explains how to use them.Despite the short main text, the book is endowed with a lavish paratextual apparatus: The title page, the poemliber invidoand a dedication to a nobleman by Remmelin are additions of the translated version. The following dedication to Wilhelm Schnöd, a member of Ulm's senate, by Faulhaber, the preface, an epigram (by Remmelin), a shortAnagrammatismusand another longer poem by Johann Conrad Merck belong already to the original work, where also the poems and anagrams are written in Latin. Only on page 17, the main text starts with an instrument for surveying towers and estates which is carried out by simple trigonometric calculations using tables of sine, cosine and tangent. The latter is still a relatively new notion in that time introduced byFinckin hisGeometria rotundiin 1583. Also, Faulhaber cites Christoff Rudolff,Michael Stifeland the Pythagorean theorem referring to ""Euclid, I 47"". The next instrument he attributes toGalileo Galileiand is a special compass which, for example, can be used to determine the side lengths of cubes made of one pound of lead, gold, iron and other materials. The last description of the first treatise teaches how to use a device for drawing perspective images.The second treatiseUsus instrumenti cuiusdam Belgae [...]is much shorter and describes another surveying instrument. The method presented boils down to drawing to scale a situation and measuring the requested lengths in the drawing.Many steps or ways how the instruments could be used are only hinted at, Faulhaber advertising private lessons where he would be happy to share his secret knowledge (p. 52).Appended to the works one finds two subscripts. One by Wilhelm Schnöd and two other authors, and a short one by a notary public (notarius publicus) who confirms with his sign the faithful translation of the work into Latin.One can only catch a glimpse on Faulhaber's usual fondness for numerology noticing the inscriptionDoMInVs tIbI prospICIeton the title page (the capital letters add up to 1610, the publication year).

The work is dedicated it to Karl Nützel, the adolescent son  of a Nuremberg patrician, to whom it might be of help in his studies. At the time of the first print, Karl was 14 years old, but is praised in the dedication for his learning and intelligence, which he showed already at the age of nine. A letter to the reader explains Sturm's previous plan to produce only one volume of the textbook and the inability to do so because of the wide spectrum of the subject. Thus, Sturm printed volume one containing a survey of more elementary subjects such as arithmetic and algebra (starting from Hindu-Arabic numerals, the decimal system and basic reckoning), geometry and trigonometry, architecture (military and civil), as well as statics and mechanics. Volume two was printed two years later and was concerned with mathematical disciplines not yet treated in the previous book, i.e. optics, including extensive discussion ofJacopo Zabarella'scamera obscura(De visu, published as books XXV and XXVI ofDe rebus naturalibus, 1590), astronomy, defending theCopernicanworld viewand rejecting astrology, chronology, horology as well aseclipsiographia, which is concerned with eclipses of the sun and moon, its description and prediction. A preface explains that the author had been inspired to compose the textbook for the use at school after counselling the Duke of Württemberg, Friedrich Karl, whether a solid mathematical education should be introduced in all gymnasia and what the lesson content should be. After sending an official letter to the Duke, the textbook is Sturm's more comprehensive answer to the question, as it gives advice and information for pupils and teachers. Sturm translated the letter itself into Latin and added it to the preface, as it contained detailed advice on what to teach pupils in the respective grades. Sturm recommends his books as an addition to Johann Christoph WagenseilsPera librorum iuvenilium, five volumes containing all the knowledge for adolescents.Both volumes contain extensive knowledge on the subjects treated, laid out in different sections and chapters. An introductory chapter answers general questions on the nature of mathematics, its disciplines and division, and its scope. Each chapter is preceded by a subtitle explaining the problem at hand. Most of the sections are laid out with numerous questions and answers in form of a catechism. This is common in scientific textbooks of the early modern time (cf.Quaesitorum et responsionum mathematicae disciplinae chilias,Epitome astronomiae,Arithmetices erotemata puerilia,Quaestiones et responsa ex arithmetica vulgari, algebra et geometria, etc.).

Sturm's work proved widely successful. A second, extended and corrected edition was printed already in 1702, a third in 1711. The work was translated into German in 1705 and knew multiple later editions in this language. An English translation was produced in 1708/9.

These lectures, lasting for two years, are covered and were published in the textbookMathesis universalis. This notion was probably more prominently shaped by Descartes or Leibniz who understood mathematics as a universal language of science. For Wallis, however, it was purely mathematical. Considering algebra as generalized arithmetic, the variables wereuniversalas they could assume any number (Rampelt 2019, 96).The extended title reveals Wallis's agenda: He presented the rules of arithmetic and algebra next to each other in order to stress their analogies; and he offered a historical and philological approach to mathematics.This becomes even more evident by a look on the chapters.After the titlepage, adedicatioto Gerard Langbain (the elder), Henry Wilkinson , John Wilkins and Jonathan Goddard, and a list of 'errata', the reader finds 45 chapters whose mathematical content cover numbers, fractions, arithmetic operations, notations and operations of algebraic expressions, sequences and logarithms. One the one hand, this ""reflects the weak state of mathematical learning at universities"" (Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 14, 149), on the other hand the work reveals the mathematical and didactical skills of its author who created a completely new approach in teaching mathematics for (almost) beginners.Thus, the first chapters do not start with the introduction of numbers and basic operations but are rather a metaphysical discussion of the aims of mathematics (chapter 1), of the relationship of geometry and arithmetic (chapter 2), on the certainty of mathematical proofs (chapter 3). Wallis picks up a debate initiated byPiccolominiin hisCommentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarumbut without knowledge of the primary source but refering to theLogicaof Martin Smiglecius. In contrast to the originally subtle distinction of so calledpotissimaeproofs analyzing the syllogisms in game, Wallis's contribution to the debate was a complete redefinition of mathematical, or more generally, scientific proof (Mancosu 1992, 252). In turn, this provokedThomas Hobbesto write his dialogueExaminatio et emendatioagainst Wallis's theses.Chapters 4 to 12 are on numbers, starting with a discussion ofunitas,numerusandnullitas. This is followed by presenting the numbers created from unity, and their Latin, Greek and Hebrew names. But also algebraic notions of the unknown (radix), its square (quadratum) and cube (cubus) can already be found at this early stage. Chapter 6 is dedicated to the etymology of numerals in various languages and is certainly more philological than mathematical. Chapter 7 is a historic one, for it deals with Greek and Hebrew number notation, and so is 8, presenting the Roman numbers. In chapter 9, theziphras saracenicas, the Hindu-Arabic numerals, are introduced, including a historic background. The next chapter presents the decimal place value system including decimal fractions (separated by a hook rather than a point or comma). Going even a step further, in chapter 11 one finds the number 27 written in various place-value systems (base 10, 60, 3 and 4). For the positions Wallis employs the notion of ascending and descending ""degrees"" (gradus) which he correctly combines with the degrees of polynomials. So, this serves as a kind of motivation for the general rules of algebra and algebraic notation. Comparing different algebraic notations (Cossists, Viète, Oughtred, Descartes) he identifies the way of writing powers with base and exponent (e.g. a³ instead of A cub.) as most useful, as the degree is visible. Atablemakes this advantage very clear. Chapter 12 is a short introduction of fractions and algebraic fractions.The next part (chapters 13–22) is dedicated to the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Always, the basic operations are taught for numbers (in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system) and extended to algebraic expressions. Two separate chapters are dedicated to applications of the operations.This covers about half of the book. The second half mostly deals with arithmetic and geometric sequences and their connection via logarithms, with the exception of chapter 23 (where some propositions of Euclid'sElementsare proved using algebra - once again demonstrating superiority of arithmetic over geometry) and the last chapters dealing with the ""rule of three"", or ""golden rule"" (regula aurea, chapters 37–40) and arithmetic with fractions (chapters 41–44) and algebraic fractions, thus covering mostly mathematics which is nowadays mostly taught at middle school (apart from logarithms). In chapter 31, Wallis introduces the notion of an ""exponent"" of a power which has become a terminus technicus up to now.Two parts are notable: Alatin poem, and thestory of the chessboard and a doubling of rice grains– entirely in Arabic! This original story takes about five pages, is then translated into Latin and finally the mathematical problem is solved.With this textbook Wallis not only wanted to teach what we understand as basic mathematics nowadays, but to give a deeper understanding of the relationships between arithmetic and algebra. And, for Wallis, arithmetic and algebra are the basic tools of mathematics, in particular, geometry. This textbook is supposed to provide students with these tools. 
Wallis proves to have an excellent knowledge of languages, history of mathematics and especially algebraic notations of the time and combines them brilliantly and with great overview and mathematical sense, which, together with various applications, anecdotes, stories and poems form an exceptional textbook.","Beeley 2013Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 14, 148–149Mancosu 1992, esp. 251–255Rampelt 2019, esp. 89–101 and 170–175","Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum‎(← links)Wallis, John‎(← links)Examinatio et emendatio‎(← links)","Wallis, John:Mathesis universalis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Mathesis_universalis(last revision: 14.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,

This reader-friendly structure, in which any questions prompted by the main text are promptly answered, is backed by a clear, well-readable Latin. On p. 238 of the second tome, in the first paragraph of chapter five, the subject of potentially harmful medications is introduced as follows:Dari in medicamentorum classe res venenatas, quae et perniciem corpori inferre et causam mortis praebere possint, mirum forsan videri poterit.That among medications there are poisonous substances, which may even destroy the body and cause death, can perhaps appear astonishing.Any confusion that could arise from the mildly paradoxical nature of this sentence, to which Hoffmann draws the reader's attention himself, is immediately removed in thescholion, where he explains that the power of a drug can cause harm as well as good and goes on to highlight the dangers of drug addiction (pharmacomania).","Maclean 2021, 262–267",De atheo convincendo ex artificiosissima machinae humanae structura‎(← links),"Hoffmann, Friedrich:Medicina rationalis systematica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Medicina_rationalis_systematica(last revision: 21.02.2022).",tome 3: no index,MK,Yes,MK,

The author of the presentTheoretical Medicine Summarized in Theses, who was professor of theoretical medicine at Basel, had his students dispute once a month about the subjects treated in his classes, in which he lectured on the canonical works of Hippocrates and Galen on physiology, pathology, and semiotics (an activity calleddiexodica enarratio, ""extensive explanation"", in the title). The written dissertations that formed the fundament of the monthly disputations (see in generalFriedenthal; Marti; Seidel 2021) were printed. After 25 years, Stupanus collected and reworked 119 of these dissertations, arranged them thematically, and republished them as one massive volume of over 800 quarto pages.The print starts from some introductory paratexts: a dedication by the printer to the author's colleagueJohannes Siglitius, another one by the author to all the former dedicatees of the single dissertations, an ode in Alcaic stanzas and an epigram in praise of the author, and a note on his citation practice. The volume is concluded by a thorough index of subjects.The dissertations form groups of up to ten items. Each group corresponds to a course in which one or several classical texts were read and is introduced by a separate title page indicating, inter alia, the year of the respective course and disputations as well as the original dedicatees and respondents. All dissertations forming part to the same course feature a running theses count. In addition, each dissertation is also structured by subtitles. The single groups are in turn ordered according to the three parts of medicine named in the title, physiology (pp. 1–317), pathology (pp. 318–568), and semiotics (pp. 569–822). In sum, a coherent overview of theoretical medicine is thus provided, starting from Galen's basic remarks inDe sectis ad tirones(pp. 1–47) and concluding with the discussion of symptoms of diseases of the procreational organs in book 6 of hisDe locis affectis(pp. 783–822).The dissertations, which run to 5–10 pages on average, provide a coherent text, whose compartmentalized subdivision into theses of a few lines makes it easy to understand. Many theses end with a citation of the classical text from which the respective statement has been taken. Greek quotations, some of them quite extensive, are often inserted in the original but usually translated as well. Stupanus' own Latin is clear and simple, and his train of thought reflects the didacticism of his lectures. Recapitulations and announcements, for instance, are frequent, as on pp. 339–340:Quae hactenus docuimus, eo pertinent omnia, ut demonstretur, quid sit morbus, quid sanitas, item quod tria sint prima summaque genera morborum. Deinceps vero docendum erit, quaenam sint praecipuae cuiusque propositorum trium generum differentiae cum simplices tum compositae.All I have taught so far aims at clarifying what disease and what health is and that there are three first and most general kinds of diseases. Subsequently, however, I will have to teach which are the most important subspecies of each of the three kinds presented, simple [defined by one feature] as well as compound [defined by several features] ones.The resulting encyclopaedia was presumably used in different ways. Practicing physicians could consult it as a work of reference thanks to its index.

The work starts from a short dedication to the senators of Hamburg and a one-page letter to the reader. In the latter, the author stresses the imperfection of all work of man including the present one, which he nonetheless believes to be useful on account of its very brevity. Depending on his readers' judgement, he will or will not go on to publish further works of his composed over the last 30 years. Both introductory pieces are written in a precious style peppered with rare expressions likearrhabo(""pledge"") and rhyming phrases likeHumus, fumus, vana et profana cuncta quae ab homine(""Dust and smoke, vain and profane are all things human"").The work itself comprises six spreads plus one single page of Ramist tables (seePhysilogices medicinae partis tabulae). The first spread is dedicated to medicine at large, the other five to the five parts of the discipline according to Galen: physiology, dietetics, semiotics, pharmaceutics, and therapeutics. Each spread confronts Galenic and 'Hermetic' (Paracelsian) medicine, which are detailed and analysed on the left and right page respectively. The relationship between these two approaches remains unexplained, but they seem to be understood as complementary rather than antagonistic. The single page at the end is devoted tomedicina specialis, the practical application of the universal truths of medical theory in the treatment of individual patients. In the right lower corner of each (double) page, one finds a short separate section concerned with theusus(""utilization"") of the information displayed. Most of the respective recommendations are truly medical, but some, strangely, are rhetorical. The information on therapeutics, for instance, may be used for anamplificatio pathetica(""emotional expansion"") regarding the multitude of diseases infesting the human body. The Ramist tables themselves are a complex and artful testimony to the author's and the printer's skills, combining horizontal brackets for the basic subdivision of Galenic and Paracelsian medicine with vertical ones for the subdivision of each variety. Every part of medicine may be subdivided on up to eight or nine levels, the single subdivisions comprising between two and 17 options. Moving first downwards, then rightwards from bracket to bracket, the reader obtains numerous different statements, which are basically complete and correct in terms of syntax. Starting from the top of the semiotics page, for instance, one may find the following (double slashes stand for brackets, single slashes for different possibilities on the same level):Semeiotica integrae adversaeve valetudinis indicia docens // Galenica describens indicia in // specie a // pulsu cuius // differentiae a // arteria, unde est vel // durus / mollis / mediocris.""Semioticics, which teaches the signs of good or bad health. // The Galenic [variety], which describes the signs from // the pulse, whose // different peculiarities [result] from // the artery, wherefrom it is // hard / soft / middle.""ThePhilosophical Cutis of interest as an attempt at combining and reconciling the two hostile strands of Galenic and Paracelsian medicine, but especially as an ambitious formal experiment with Ramist tables in scientific publishing.

In the end, this probably was a bit too much, resulting in a virtuosotour de forcein Ramist subdivision rather than in a useful didactic or mnemotechnic tool.

The next year, the publisher of theHistoria vitisreissued an extended version of the medical collection as the first and eponymous part of a new book in which it was followed by two similar collections and the story of a stillbirth by other physicians and by a tabular outline of the nature of the human body by Dodoens himself. The book was introduced by a dedication to the archbishop-elector of Mainz, Daniel Brendel von Homburg, a letter to the reader, a table of contents, copious indices (authors quoted, Hippocratic aphorisms discussed, important topics and words) and a list of errata.Remberts observations are the fruit of forty years of experience as a practising doctor, as he explains on the second-last page of the introductory letter to the reader:Scripsimus idcirco et nonnulla de admirandis nec passim obviis affectibus, quos supra quadraginta annos, quibus in artis exercitio versamur, observatos habemus.As the letter further details, this and similar collections aim at extending the range of medical experience – therefore the focus on rare and strange cases – so that further medical rules may be established by inductive reasoning in the future (nam artem experientia facit exemplo monstrante viam, third-last page).The observations number 53 and fill pp. 1–128, a little over one fourth of the entire volume. They are roughly arrangeda capite ad pedes, starting with a case of cerebral concussion and ending with a boy whose feet fell off due to gangrene. In between, one finds, inter alia, a case of rabies (De hydrophobia, ch. 12), a stone in the lungs (De calculo pulmonis, ch. 23) and a case of scurvy (De scorbuto, ch. 33). Many observations exhibit a tripartite structure: They start from some general remarks, describe a pertinent case and finally give an explanation of what had happened. Often, however, the discussion of the case is transferred to a separate appendix titledScholion.The report proper most often takes the form of a short narration of the disease process. Dodoens rarely makes use of the first person singular or gives any indication that he was in fact an eyewitness to the case described. Nonetheless, his accounts abound with graphic detail. He describes not only the bodily symptoms, but sometimes also the emotional state of his patients and pities their sufferings. For instance, his account of the gangrenous boy (ch. 53, p. 128) concludes:Sic tandem miser puer mutilatis ac amissis membris periit.(""Thus the wretched boy had his limbs truncated, lost them and finally perished."")TheMedicinalium observationum exempla rarawere republished at least once more (Harderwijk: Hendricksz, 1585).

The University of Marburg, whose highest-ranking professor of medicine Baldinger had been, commissioned Friedrich Creuzer, its professor of Greek, eloquence, and poetics (who would soon become a famous classicist and historian of religion in Heidelberg), to produce an obituary.Creuzer’sCommemoration of Ernst Gottfried Baldingerfeatures no paratexts apart from the informative title page. It falls into two parts: a biography of the deceased (pp. 3–32) and a bibliography of his works (pp. 33–42).The biography starts from a praise of medicine in general (pp. 3–6). In its main part, Baldinger's family of origin, birth, early education, academic training, service as a military doctor in the Prussian army during the Seven Years' War, career as practicing doctor and university professor in Jena, Göttingen, and Marburg, mertis for the latter university, two marriages, family life, last years, and death are discussed in chronological order (pp. 6–26). This account is followed by a sketch of Baldinger's appearance, intellectual profile, habits, and character (pp. 26–32). As for the content of the biography, it is noteworthy that it  does not leave out problematic aspects of the biographee's life and character despite its generally laudatory approach. For instance, tensions between Baldinger and his father, who had destined his son for a career as a clergyman (pp. 9, 11–12), Baldinger's external neglect in later years (p. 26–7), his sharp tongue (he is calledvehementer dicax, pp. 27–8), and his addiction to drink (p. 29) and fame (p. 31) are openly addressed. Such remarks may be explained by an enlightened disdain of dishonest 'hagiography' (cf.Korenjak; Schaffenrath; Šubarić; Töchterle 2012, 949–50 for a comparable example) as well as by the model of Suetonius' biographies, which freely mix praise with blame (by contrast, Creuzer departs from Suetonius in placing the biographee's death before, not after, the sketch of his personality). In terms of style, theCommemorationis written in elaborate, polished periods which match the dignity of the occasion without becoming pompous or obscure. Creuzer's Latin is fluent and easy to read.The bibliography lists Baldinger's copious and multi-faceted, partly Latin, partly German production from his doctoral dissertation (1760) to a characterization of the mineral water of Dinkhold (1801), including translations and later editions. However, Baldinger's contributions to academic journals are only mentioned summarily at the end.Creuzer's obituary provides the most complete account ever produced of Baldinger's life and works.Later biographical sketchesof the eminent doctor are clearly indebted to it.",,"Creuzer, Friedrich‎(← links)","Creuzer, Friedrich:Memoria Ernesti Godofredi Baldingeri, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Memoria_Ernesti_Godofredi_Baldingeri(last revision: 06.11.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Witte criticises, however, Melchior’s Calvinist approach in the preface of his first volume on theologians (p. 17 f.). Other than Melchior, Witte did not compile different sources and created his own version of the memorial writings if he could find a good source that he could print without changes. If he could not find a good one, he would write a vita out of the information he could gather elsewhere. Moreover, he translated German funeral speeches into Latin.

With these letters, Gassendi revealed himself as a supporter of the Copernican system. Based on Johannes Kepler'sAdmonitio ad astronomosof 1629, in which the astronomer had predicted dates for the solar transitions of Mercury and Venus in the year 1631, Gassendi set out to prove Kepler's predictions and rules, not with acamera obscura, as Kepler had intended, but with the help of a telescope.The work lacks any paratexts. It begins with the first letter to Gassendi's friend, Wilhelm Schickard, professor of Hebrew at the University of Tübingen and newly appointed professor of astronomy, reporting his observation of the solar transition of Mercury on 7 November 1631 in Paris and presenting it as a great discovery, as no one before him had managed to see the planet in the way he had. After a playful introduction to the topic, the report follows shortly and displays a technical style. Gassendi describes his wait for the transition of Mercury for three full days, and the problematic weather conditions on the respective days. Using a telescope to focus the sun's rays, Gassendi studied a small spot, which he did not recognize to be Mercury immediately because of his surprisingly small size, exceedingly smaller than Kepler's predictions. After identifying it as Mercury, Gassendi determined its size as 20 seconds of arc and concluded that its distance to the sun as well as the distances of bodies in the universe had to be greater than hitherto imagined. 
Furthermore, he discussed problems with apparent sizes and what could influence variations of those, as well as with parallaxes. Apart from a praise of the methods and beliefs of Kepler, the letter includes anapologiaof Epicurus, who had also voiced the heavily criticized opinion that heavenly bodies may be smaller than they appear because the respective body itself cannot be distinguished clearly from the light they emit.
The letter is followed by a postscript about the lunar eclipse of the following day. 
The second letter in the volume reports Gassendi's attempt to similarly observe the solar transition of Venus at the beginning of December of the same year. However, the event did not, as predicted by Kepler, happen during the European day, but during the night, so it was impossible for Gassendi to observe from Paris. Still, he sends Schickard a detailed report of his failed experiment. Appended after the second, shorter letter, is an extract from a letter to Kepler dating from 1630, as well as anAuctuariumaddressed toSchickard, on observations of various astronomical phenomena.
Gassendi's discovery that Mercury was considerably smaller than astronomers had believed so far was met with surprise, especially as numerous astronomers had similarly, but unsuccessfully tried to observe the transit of the planet on this day. Schickard, whoanswered Gassendi in printthe very same year, was not convinced that Gassendi's observations were correct in this respect.","Joy 1987, 106–110Van Helden 1976","Gassendi, Pierre‎(← links)De Mercurio in sole viso‎(← links)Mercurius in sole visus Gedani‎(← links)De Mercurio sub sole viso‎(← links)","Gassendi, Pierre:Mercurius in sole visus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Mercurius_in_sole_visus(last revision: 27.07.2021).",,JL,Yes,JL,

This phenomenon had already been visible in Europe in 1631, andPierre Gassendihad shared the results of his observation in a printedletter, while Hevelius like many of his colleagues all over the continent had not been able to see it due to unfortuitous weather conditions. The second transit in Hevelius' lifetime, which had happened in 1651, was not visible in Europe at all. The astronomer therefore diligently prepared himself for the third event, which he successfully observed and presented to his colleagues in his work of 110 pages. It is dedicated to Ismael Boulliau, astronomer and secretary to the French ambassador in Holland, with whom he had been in contact (cf. Hevelius'Selenographia). After a lively defence of astronomy, Hevelius presents his observations and thoughts leading up to the solar transit, including the respective tables as well as his drawings of the events: a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse in 1659, a solar eclipse in 1661 as well as observations of the other planets. He explains how he carefully studied the different ephemerides of Mercury, the Danish, Alphonsine, Rudolfine, Lansbergian tables and those of the addressee Boulliau, to calculate the exact time of the event. Hevelius found them, however, contradictory, so he diligently observed the heavens over several days, so as not to miss seeing Mercury in the sun. Mixing engaging narrative with the presentation of technical data, as well as tables and drawings, Hevelius shows how he carefully studied the heavens, until on the third of May he succeeded in identifying an appearing small shadow as Mercury. He concludes that Mercury indeed had to be decidedly smaller than Tycho Brahe's calculations, and even Gassendi's observation of 1631. The author relates his observation and conclusions as a mix of lively narrative, including his emphatic outburst when he perceived Mercury, engaging instruction for his reader, frequently addressed as ""Astrophilus"", tables, charts and drawings of the events he observed.

In both versions, the book is dedicated to all people interested in the study of nature.In a short, two-page letter to the reader, Merian provides a stylized account about her life-long interest in the study of insects, which she has pursued since youth to the point that she preferred the observations and drawing of insects to the company of other people (quamobrem humana plane deserens consortia unice his vacavi observationibus). While she had the possibility to see insects from the New World in the Netherlands, she wanted to find out about their development and metamorphosis and thus undertook a research journey to Suriname herself. According to the letter, she drew all of the plants and animalsad vivum, exept a few about which she had only heard from the local population.The 60 engravings occupy one page each and depict the insects in their various stages of development in an stylized arrangement, but with great naturalistic detail and according to their natural size, on the plants on which Merian observed them. Each engraving is accompanied by a short Latin explanatory text which varies in length between half a page and a page. The Latin texts are easily readable and describe first the plants (e.g. pine apples, cocoa, and passion fruit), then the insects depicted on them and their metamorphosis (sometimes, this also includes microscopic observations). Names of plants and insects are usually given in the vernacular, and Merian does not attempt to coin new names for new plants herself (however, the Latin names are still indicated in the notes by the botanist Caspar Commelin). The observation of the insects is often presented as a first-person narrative, in which Merian informs the reader when she found the insect in question and how and when it developed into another form. The descriptions are short, but rich in detail and very vivid (e.g. Merian describes how cockroaches can slip through tiny cracks into a house, or how the branches of the pomelo tree nearly break under its fruits). Furthermore, the beauty of the insects, especially the butterflies, is repeatedly praised within the texts.In the 18th century, Merian'sMetamorphosis insectorum Surinamensiumwas edited four more times. The first two editions contained the Latin text: in 1719, a slightly expanded edition appeared again in two different versions, Latin and Dutch, while in 1726, the Latin text was reprinted side-to-side with a French translation in the same volume.","van Delft; Mulder 2017(facsimile of the first edition with German translation)Harmon; Gross 2007, 78–80","Historia naturalis de quadrupedibus‎(← links)Merian, Maria Sibylla‎(← links)","Merian, Maria Sibylla:Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Metamorphosis_insectorum_Surinamensium(last revision: 23.02.2022).","Upon her return, she is urged to publish the results of her research (a literary topos), as her work of images is thought to be “the best and most beautiful among the works ever drawn in America (primum et pulcherrimum ex operibus umquam in America pictis).On the length of explications:Easque extendere longius facilis mihi res fuisset; attamen cum hodie orbis adeo sit delicatus neque ipsos inter eruditos conveniat, observationibus simplicter inhaerere meis, hisque materiam suppeditare volui, unde posset unusquisque, prout libuerit, considerationes instituere illasque secundum beneplacitum applicare.(model: Bidloo'sAnatomia).",DB,Yes,IT,

It was dedicated to Emperor Joseph I by Johann Bernhard Caelestin von Rödern, a young nobleman, on the occasion of a public disputation about the whole of philosophy that marked the end of his philosophical studies in Linz.In the dedicatory letter and the preface to the reader, von Röder und Reinzer respectively insist on the existence of a correlation between the effects of meteorology and forces and events in the realm of politics. The main body of the text is divided into 12 sections (dissertationes) structured in accordance with meteorological events in relation to their origin. Thus, the compendium starts with adissertatioon the very science of meteorology, which is followed by several dissertations on celestial effects, while the last two parts are devoted to earthquakes, volcanoes, and other subterranean things. To every major meteorological effect, Reinzer claims, a certain political virtue, action, or policy corresponds. To prove his point, Reinzer abundantly refers to both ancient authorities (for instance, by quoting ancient, both Greek and Latin poetry concerned with meteorology) and Renaissance and early modern scholars. For the most part, his account relies on the contemporary understanding of meteorological effects and largely draws onAthanasius Kircher. Also, Reinzer supplements his argument with numerous (and beautiful) illustrations, which combine various meteorological events (such as volcanoes, rains, snow etc) and episodes of political life.The fiftyConclusiones ex universa philosophiaactually defended by von Rödern fill the very last page.

This method allowed for an investigation of algebraic equations based on their roots. Inspired by a problem of Pappus'sMathematical collection, Fermat assumes two distinct roots, finds relations and in one step divides by their (nonzero!) difference. As the roots coincide in the case of a maximum or minimum, Fermat obtains his result by setting the difference to zero in the end. Assuming that the roots are different first and consider them equal afterwards is a logical contradiction which Fermat hide behind the term of adequality (adaequalitas), which he had borrowed from Diophantus, a useful antique authority.Fermat was very reluctant to publish his mathematical inventions but around 1636 Parisian mathematicians convinced him to lay open his method. His concession were the first two pages of this work. Constituting more or less the manuscript version which circulated in Paris these two pages leave the reader with more questions than answers. This lack in clarity was deliberate in order to mask the ideas.Turning to these first two pages themselves, Fermat first presents an ""algorithmic outline"" of his method, hardly helpful for anyone who would like to apply it to a practical problem. Then comes an application of this method, namely for finding tangents to given curves which is reduced to the extreme value problem. This is carried out for the parabola, a case whose solution was already well-known and this time, and in this special case a general algorithm is not covered. However, Fermat claims that his method is absolutely general and applies to any curve, a point which he clearly missed to make on these two pages.This is in part better on the following pages, which are compiled to this ten-page work in theOpera varia. Their genesis is different, but they have eventually been put together with the first two pages. Among them is a paragraph on finding the center of gravity of a paraboloid, and the solutions of various tangent problems, in particular of the conchoid of Nicomedes.Fermat's mathematical notation is a mixture of Greek-style reasoning and Viéte's way of denoting algebraic terms (capital letters for variables). In a kind of confusing manner he uses the letters A and E both for unknowns and for points in diagrams at the same time. Also the treatment of curves is still old-fashioned: The parabola is described by Apollonios'ssymptomarather than by a curve equation in the style of Analytic Geometry to which Fermat shifted later in his life.This method on finding maxima and minima of a function and the application on tangents was in the core of a mathematical dispute betweenDescartesand Fermat. Descartes, proudly defending hisGeometry, criticized Fermat's contradictory method of adequality but finally had to admit in 1638, that his methods rested on the same assumptions (Dictionary of Scientific Biography 1970–1986, vol. 4, 571).","Mahoney 1994143-169Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 4, 569–571","Fermat, Pierre de‎(← links)De aequationum localium transmutatione et emendatione‎(← links)Nova methodus pro maximis et minimis‎(← links)Nova stereometria doliorum‎(← links)","Fermat, Pierre de:Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Methodus_ad_disquirendam_maximam_et_minimam(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,,Yes,FB,

It is part of a compendium of Newton'sOperaedited and translated by Johann Castillion, who also added avita of Newton. A quick comparison of the Latin manuscript and the Latin translation makes clear that Castillion could not have known the original. The manuscript was assembled around 1671, when Newton collected his investigations in calculus. His first publishing attempts remained unsuccessful and later he abandoned the idea to publish it. When it appeared in 1736 however, its content was far from being revolutionary as it certainly would have been in 1671. The results were already well known and had been disseminated in the mathematical community.Inspired byvan Schooten'sedition ofDescartes'sGeometrywithHeuraet'streatise on rectificationappended as well as byWallis'sArithmetica infinitorum, young Newton dedicated himself to the ""analytic art"". His main discovery there was the binomial series for real exponents and series would be his first main method. The other one was the ""method of fluxions"", a notion of velocity. He considered points (x,y) (""fluents"") flowing in space driven by their fluxions.The first part consists of a polished version of an early work by Newton which is usually referred to asDe Analysi. There he explains how to reduce various algebraic rational and surd expressions to series. Then the method of fluxions is presented. In contrast to the manuscript, wheremis the fluxion of the fluentxandnofy, the 1736 English and 1744 Latin version use the more intuitive ""dot notation"" which Newton only invented in 1691:ẋbeing the fluxion ofx;ẏofyetc.The main part however is structured in twelve problems which contain the most important questions of calculus:Problem 1 treats how to obtain the fluxions from given fluents (""differentiation"").Problem 2 is dedicated to finding the fluents from given fluxions (""indefinite integration"").In problem 3maximaandminimaof curves are investigated with the help of fluxions.Problem 4 deals with the task how to find tangents of given curves.Problems 5 and 6 are dedicated to curvature;Problems 7 to 9 contain questions of quadrature. Newton uses the results of problem 2, thus the fundamental theorem of calculus. He solves integrals by the method of substitution and provides a comprehensive table of indefinite integrals for practical purposes. Onp. 150Newton uses his Binomial theorem to calculate the area of a circle. This establishes a very elegant new method for finding many digits of Pi (Newton obtains 16 digits easily).Problems 10 to 12 finally are concerned with the rectification of curves.Newton's reluctance to publish the results prevented the treatise to become a decisive moment in the history of mathematics. Dropping some results for example in the second letter toLeibnizand on other occasions made his methods known in the mathematical community, but rather fragmentarily. When it was published, Leibniz, the Bernoullis and others had already solved the major part of the presented problems. Nevertheless, it was exactly this Latin translation of the first printed edition which made most of the following continental European mathematicians familiar with Newton's methods.","Anthony 1960, 17–23Edwards 1979, 209–222Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 10, 44–50Whiteside 1967–1981, vol.

In this paper, published in the Royal Society’sPhilosophical Transactions, Halley sets out his method for the calculation, including an influential diagram of the transit and its measurement (the first page of the digitised document linked here), as well as a number of suggestions for the best places from which to observe the phenomenon.Having introduced his idea and his experience with the transit of Mercury (454–457), Halley moves directly into a  presentation of his method (457–460). On the basis of this description he now updates the estimated contemporary parallax to 17 minutes (460). Using this new estimate he enters a more detailed discussion of the method using the example of an observation in London on the 25th May 1761 (Halley uses the ‘Old Style’ Julian calendar as standard at this time in England) (461–463). He then discusses the imagined results of an observation from the Ganges delta (463–464) and from Nelson’s Dockyard, Antigua (464).Aside from the realisation of the necessity of at least two observers, ideally situated to give the largest possible observer parallax from the earth, Halley’s paper also served as a call to the wider scientific community for systematic observations of the 1760s transits. The first of these (1761) was coordinated, in effect, by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle who had met Halley in 1724 and who responded to the Englishman’sMethoduswith a far-reaching call to action in 1760.

Like other subdisciplines of physiognomy, metoposcopy enjoyed some popularity in the early modern period (Maclean 2002, 319–20). It was developed from remarks in ancient forerunners by kabbalistic authors, but its most extended and systematic treatment comes from the pen of Girolamo Cardano. As many of Cardano's works, this one was published only long after his death in France by  Claude Martin de Laurendière with Thomas Jolly. The both of them simultaneously printed a French translation as well (La métoposcopie de H. Cardan, médecin Milanois). The Latin edition is dedicated by the printer to the influential politician Nicolas Fouquet (1615–80), a man with an obvious interest in quickly judging the character and intentions of the people surrounding him. A letter by the editor to the reader extols Cardano's genius and introduces the somewhat exotic subject. (Unfortunately, it is nowhere explained where the work's manuscript, which must have contained a huge number of images drawn by Cardano himself – see below – actually comes from.) After Cardano's treatise, a short work by an anonymous Greek author known as ps.-Melampus on divination from moles and birthmarks is appended in the original Greek with facing Latin translation.Cardano's metoposcopic system is complex and difficult to understand. The reader gets the impression that the multitude of parameters to be taken into account opens up an unrestricted freedom of interpretation and results in largely arbitrary diagnoses and predictions. Cardano, however, seems to have been convinced that his system worked. In his eyes, metoposcopy was not an exact science, but as in all other disciplines and arts concerned with the sublunar world, an experienced practitioner could mostly, if not always, obtain good results (p. III). Three important characteristics of Cardanos's system are the following: First, thelineae(""lines"") in question are not only lines in the common sense of the word, but comprise all kinds of irregularities of the skin (p. IV). Second, their interpretation is based on the division of the forehead into seven horizontal stripes which correspond to the seven planets, from Saturn on top to the moon at the bottom (see esp. p. 2). So Cardano's system is conceptually close to astrology (as it also is to ancient medicine, by the way; the four qualities of hot, cold, dry and moist play a considerable role in his interpretations). Third, simple metaphorical connections are regularly drawn between the properties of the lines and their significance: lines appearing on the left side are worse than those at the right side, strong lines portend strong effects, rare configurations unusual events and so on.Cardono's treatise comprises some 250 quarto pages and is divided in 13 short books, which are conveniently enumerated on the next-to-last page before thePrivilège du Roy. Book 1 introduces the reader to the general rules of metoposcopy, book 2 discusses differences between men and women. Books 3–9 are devoted to lines allocated to each of the seven planets. In books 10 and 11, lines appearing in more than on planetary region and lines running through several regions respectively are discussed. Book 12 is dedicated exclusively to women (while most of the other books discuss men only or in the first place). The final book 13 is dedicated to birthmarks (naevi).Apart from book 1, which consists of running text and of collections of rules, aphorisms and observations, all the other books are structured in the same way. They present a series of woodcuts of human heads with strongly marked lines on the forehead – typically four per page, some 800 all in all, as indicated in the full title. (Most foreheads appear quite strange to the modern reader, who often has the impression that he has never seen anything like them in real life.) Each woodcut is followed by a short caption, in which the respective configuration is interpreted. The second caption on p. 78, for instance, reads:Si praedicta linea Mercurii in plures partes divisa sit, valde rude eius ingenium coniecturari potest et eius studia interrupta, eiusque fortuna ad diversas miserias inclinabitur.(""If the aforementioned line of Mercury is divided in several parts, one can conjecture that the mind of the respective person is most uneducated and his studies have been interrupted. His fate will be prone to various forms of wretchedness."")TheMetoposcopiaprobably worked better as a handbook for the would-be metoposcopist than as a theoretical treatise. Even the reader who felt lost in Cardano's brief and contorted exposition of his theory could look up the faces of friends, colleagues and acqaintances (as well as his own!) in the main part of the work and draw his conclusions from what he found there.",,"Cardano, Girolamo‎(← links)","Cardano, Girolamo:Metoposcopia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Metoposcopia(last revision: 21.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The work is clearly inspired by Robert Hooke’sMicrographiawhich is also reflected in the titleMicrographia nova(seeRebohm 2015, 49). In the dedicatory letter to King Leopold I, Griendel von Ach stresses that the newmicrocosmusis worth studying and highlights the new possibilities of observation with the help of new optical instruments like the telescope, theperspectiva, and the microscope.The work itself is divided into eight bigger chapters calledobservationes, in which he deals with (1) the technical details of his microscope, (2) observations of some insects (including ants with and without wings; head/eye/foot of a fly; egg of flea) and of the reproduction of frogs, (3) smallervermes, i.e. small animals such as mites, etc., (4) parts of flowers, (5) textiles and fabrics, (6) hair of different species (including different kinds of human hair), (7) seeds, (8) various curiosities (e.g. an arrowhead, a needle, a typed letter, ebony,...). There is obviously no inherent logical order of the different chapters and Griendel von Ach describes plants, animals, and artificial objects without distinction. 
The texts are usually quite short (about 1–2 pages) and refer to the depictions and the structures to be seen there by a system of letters. The texts usually do not offer real new insights from a scientific point of view (seeRebohm 2015, 49), but feature some engaging descriptions. Especially interesting is a comparison of a fight between a louse and a flea with animal fights in the Roman amphitheaters on page 16. He also praises the wonders of flies that would be more acknowledged if the animal was as big as a rhinoceros or an elephant (page 25f.; he links this remark, furthermore, to the German saying “aus einer Mücke einen Elefanten machen”).
The Latin is at times hard to understand. Interestingly, the author apologizes for the use of the non-classical termperspectivawith the following exclamation in parentheses:ignoscite Latino Latina non proferente Ciceroniani manes.

Collected under the title ofNaturae et artis varia(""Various Things in Nature and Art""), a number of these epigrams deal with scientific and technical instruments. Apart from the aforementioned thermometre and megaphone, there are also distichs on the sundial, the compass, the microscope, geographical and astronomical globes and automata.Here, we shall have a closer look at the epigram on the microscope. The distich plays with the fact that the instrument makes tiny insects look different in unexpected ways, revealing their surprising attributes or enlarging them to the size of massive animals (cf. theMelissographia, an engraved broadsheet on the bee under the microscope). The poet addresses the microscope (or perhaps the one who looks through the microscope) directly:Enumeras rostrum pulicis, culicisque sagittas,per te musca elephas, vespaque rhinoceros.""You show the beak of the flea, the darts of the midge, through you, the fly becomes an elephant and the wasp a rhinoceros"".The epigram is artfully constucted: The chiasm in the hexametre letspulicis(""of the flea"") andculicis(""of the midge"") clash in the middle of the verse, producing a striking rhyme that is probably intended to create a comical effect. The pentametre on the other hand uses a parallelism, the opposite figure to the chiasm, so that the names of tiny and huge animals alternate, highlighting the remarkable ""transformations"" that take place under the microscope. In addition, the first transformation, that of the fly into an elephant, is also a quite literal take on the well-known proverbElephantum ex musca facis(""You make an elephant out of a fly"", i.e. You exaggerate a small matter enourmously, cf.Erasmus,Adagia1.9.69).In this series of distichs, the various instruments are taken as the basis for the pointed reflection which is typical for epigrammatic poetry. The epigrams thus represent a form of engagement with contemporary science which uses the main idea of an instrument or the way it works as an interesting subject matter for this concise and witty genre of Neo-Latin poetry that was ubiquitous in early modern times.",,"De obscuritate philosophiae ac de repertis Isaaci Newtoni‎(← links)Strozzi, Leone‎(← links)","Strozzi, Leone:Microscopium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Microscopium(last revision: 21.06.2021).",,IT,Yes,IT,

The encyclopedia has attracted attention in modern scholarship for its title: according to Mottana, the Latin wordmineralogiaappears for the first time on the title page of Cesi's work, although it was not picked up by other writers of mineralogical works at the time. ThatMineralogiawas an unusal title might be indicated by the fact that it was only used on the title page (where it was followed by a typical baroque title detailing the contents of the book), whileDe mineralibus, a standard title for mineralogical works, was printed as both the half-title and the running title of the encyclopedia. Indeed, Cesi himself states at the beginning of the first chapter of his book that he chose the titleDe mineralibus vel de mineralogiaas a reference to Albertus Magnus's famous medieval workDe mineralibusbecause such a title would be more pleasing to the people (vulgus) than other standard titles such asde re metallicaorde fossilibus(p. 1).The main body of the work is a meticulous compilation of information on minerals from ancient and modern sources, describing, on 626 pages, different minerals (without any pictures), their usefulness (medical or other) as well as their symbolic meaning within Christian religion. The religious interpretation pervading the work culminates in the part on gems, which is focussed on the twelve gems of the priestly breastplate (rationale) and the twelve gems of the apocalypse (e.g. each gem of the rationale stands for a tribe of Israel, an apostle and a virtue of Christ).Book 1 (pp. 1-136) serves as an introduction, opening with a vindication of mineralogy, proving it to be equally delightful and useful. In a list of many uses from medicine to art, the religious significance of gems is stressed in particular: The study of minerals leads to a better understanding of Holy Scripture, the minerals themselves function as motivatingmystica virtutum symbola. The author shows himself to be rather conservative, structuring his argument according to the Aristotelian causes and favouring geocentrism (p. 117); However, he is prepared to admit a mistake by Aristotle, as becomes evident in the discussion on the galaxy (p. 49). Book 2 deals with soils (De terris insignibus, pp. 137-287; including colours, pigments, and painting), book 3 with solidified liquids (De succis concretis, pp. 288-512, including mirrors), book 4 on stones and gems (De lapidibus et gemmis, pp. 513-608) and book 5 on metals (De metallis, pp. 609-626).Book 4 and 5 are rather short in comparison, testifying to the unfinished state of the work, which was published posthumously by Cesi’s fellow Jesuits. It appeared only in one edition split into two issues differing only in the dedication (to Francesco I d’Este by the Jesuits and to Charles de Neufville by the editor Jacob Prost).

It is in fact a dynamic definition, where two line segments move with different speeds. Notably, this definition leads to a logarithm of the base 1/e (with Euler's number e) only multiplied by 10 Million in order to avoid fractions. However, it has to be pointed out that Napier had no concept of a base of a logarithm. After the definition, he presents useful properties, rules for practical calculations and examples how to use the charts.The second book is dedicated to the use of logarithms in trigonometry. Already the organisation of the charts by degrees and minutes, sines and their logarithms hints to the main scope of Napier: to alleviate trigonometrical calculations. Book II gives geometers and astronomers a collection of useful examples how to use charts of logarithms to their advantage in tedious computations. The law of cosines in the sphere, for example, requires the multiplication of three numbers. With six or more significant digits per number, multiplying them was extremely time consuming. The same holds for the law of sines with one multiplication and one division. Logarithms reduced multiplications and divisions to additions and subtractions, which could be executed much faster.The logarithms proved a momentous invention indeed, and Napier's work made him famous throughout the whole of Europe almost instantaneously. They had been foreshadowed byMichael Stifelin hisArithmetica integrawhere first steps of ""multiplying by adding exponents"" were taken. This was most probably one of Napier's inspirations, and although his construction differs considerably from Stifel's, they share the key idea of turning the multiplication into an addition. Many works followed refining and extending his charts of logarithms (e.g. Briggs 1617 and Briggs 1624, Bürgi 1620). 
The value ofMirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptioto astronomy is often ignored: While the telescope's role is widely appreciated, the more technical tool for calculations ""doubled the astronomer's lifespan"" and paved the way for detailled and accurate astronomical tables (cf.Tabulae Rudolphinae;Tabulae manuales logarithmicae).","Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 286–288;Havil 2014;McOmish 2017","Tabulae Rudolphinae‎(← links)Napier, John‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Tabulae manuales logarithmicae‎(← links)Chilias logarithmorum‎(← links)Ad lectorem trigonometriae studiosum‎(← links)Arithmetica integra‎(← links)","Napier, John:Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Mirifici_logarithmorum_canonis_descriptio(last revision: 14.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

Burnet had claimed, inter alia, that the world as created by God had been flat and smooth, without any mountains, and that the latter's existence was a collateral damage of the Flood.As the preface of theMountains as Witnesses of the Deityshows, Feuerlein distorts Burnet's argument into the statement that mountains are incompatible with God's benevolence and very existence, thus turning his opponent into an atheist (that is what his coupling with Lucretius in the title is meant to imply). He then polemicises against this ficticious position by demonstrating the utility of mountains. In doing so, he starts from Lucretius, who indeed uses the great part of the earth taken up by mountains to deny the existence of a divine world order (§ I), and attacks him broadly speaking from two directions. First, mountains are defended on esthetic grounds (§§ II–IV). After that, they are shown to be useful to mankind as water reservoirs, habitat of medical plants etc. (§§ V–VIII). The dissertation concludes with the triumphant assertion that mountains testify to God's benevolence (§ IX) and with the concession to Burnet, that they are indeed subject to some changes (§ X). Three short corollaries list further arguments agains Burnet and company: There were rivers aon earth before the Flood, so there most have bee mountains, too; maritime fossils found on mountains confirm the biblical account of the Flood; Canaan is a great country despite its mountains.The intellectual level of the text is mediocre, but Feuerlein is well acquainted with all aspects of the Burnet debate and of the discussions around mountains in general, and he is not one to hide his knowledge. His argument is backed up by a great many footnotes referring to earlier and contemporary authorities, especially to the pious Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer. Feuerlein mostly writes in sonourous periods, which are nontheless quite easy to understand, which is also due to his general avoidance of technical jargon.","Kempe 2003, 207–208.","Feuerlein, Jakob Wilhelm‎(← links)Montes Divinitatis testes contra Lucretium et Burnetium(redirect page) ‎(← links)Lochner, Christoph Moritz‎(← links)","Feuerlein, Jakob Wilhelm; Lochner, Christoph Moritz:Montes divinitatis testes, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Montes_divinitatis_testes(last revision: 09.08.2021).",p. 11 quote of Burnet's description of mountains asconfusissima congeries ruderum et fragmentorum.,,Yes,WB,

The elegyMontgolferii machina volans(The Flying Machine of Montgolfier) by the Italian Neo-Latin poet Giuseppe Taruffi, was published as a leaflet of 10 printed pages. Dated June 1784 (p. 10), the poem of 168 verses is an immediate reaction to the first Italian balloon flight performed by the Milanese Paolo Andreani in March of the same year. Taruffi addresses (and dedicates) his elegy on the hot air ballon toBenedikt Stay, a fellow member of the Academy of Arcadia and one of the most prolific scientific didactic poets in 18th century, who versified Cartesian philosophy in 6 (Philosophia versibus tradita, 1744) and Newtonian philosophy in 10 books (Philosophia recentior versibus tradita, 1755–1792).After the proem and the invocation of Stay as his poetic helper, theMontgolferii machina volansopens with the discovery of the properties of air, which leads to the construction of a hot air ballon. The ascension, flight, descent and landing of the balloon are then described in colourful detail and with two epic similes, resulting in a hymn to Montgolfier and an enthusiastic vision of the future, when all parts of the earth are easily accessible by air and knowledge will be advanced further. Lucretian tones can be detected throughout the elegy, e.g. in the praise of reason and the praise of Montgolfier (Lucretius was also the main model of Benedikt Stay). The poem also touches upon different ancient myths, rejecting the story of Icarus and likening the ascending hot air balloon to the ship Argo and its descent to Selene visiting Endymion.Taruffi's elegy was later included in theEclogae recentiorum carminum Latinorum, an anthology of Neo-Latin poetry published in Hannover in 1793.","Wiegand 1984, 37–39;Bitzel 1997, 226–7","Taruffi, Giuseppe Antonio‎(← links)","Taruffi, Giuseppe Antonio:Montgolferii machina volans, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Montgolferii_machina_volans(last revision: 26.03.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,IT,

In chs. 3–7, he struggles for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon, distinguishing it from other alpine phenomena such as cristals and avalanches, noting characteristic features and behaviour such as crevasses, advancement and retreat, and trying to explain these traits. Thus Hottinger's work is decidedly scientific in its aspirations. Despite undeniable progress in some areas, it remains however pre-scientific in its results, since a scientifically correct understanding of glaciers remains beyond Hottinger's reach: He fails to realize that a glacier is no mountain (hence his persistent talk ofmontes glaciales), has no clear insight into the slow metamorphosis of snow into ice and does not grasp the fact that glaciers flow downhill. All the same, his focussed treatment did much to kindle new interest in the phenomenon, resulting in the birth of scientific glaciology with Saussure'sOration on glaciershalf a century later.Hottinger writes a pedestrian Latin that can be hard to follow.

Pardies","Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 7/84, 4091–3",1672,London,Martyn,17th century,"Letter, Journal Paper",Physics,Mr. Newtons Letter(JSTOR),865569,"In Feburary of 1672, Isaac Newton had published his groundbreaking new theory about light and colours in the 80th issue of thePhilosophical Transactions, maintaining that white light was made up of spectral colours which were differently refrangible. Initially, however, Newton's theory met with critisicm. An early critical reaction to Newton's paper, aLatin letterby the Parisian Jesuit and professor of mathematicsIgnace Pardieswritten in April 1672 to the editor of thePhilosophical TransactionsHenry Oldenburg prompted Newton to address the criticism in a Latin letter of his own. Newton's answer was printed together with Pardies' letter in the 84th issue of thePhilosophical Transactions.Newton's three page letter, like Pardies', is addressed to Henry Oldenburg, who acted as an intermediary between the two mathematicians and thus enabled their scientific discussion. The text presents itself as a conversation with his friend about the criticism the Parisian Jesuit raised in his letter. Thus, Newton's answer is framed in terms of friendship (amicitia, the topical prerequisite for letter-writing). It is the friendship to Oldenburg that motivates him to respond to Pardies' objections to his theory:Accepi observationes Reverendi Patris Ignatii Pardies in epistolam meam de lucis refractionibus et coloribus ad te conscriptam, quo nomine me illi valde devinctum agnosco atque hoc difficultatibus, quas proposuit, eluendis rescribo.(""I received the observations of the Reverend Father Ignace Pardies about my letter on the refractions and colours of light which I wrote to you: therefore, I find myself very much obliged to him and write this answer in order to solve the problems that he proposed."") In addition, Newton's letter – though straight to the point like Pardies' – ends in a shortconclusio, which Pardies' letter lacks: In the affectionate goodbye to Oldenburg, Newton implicitly affirms once more friendship as the condition for this scientific exchange.In the main part of the letter, Newton counters and corrects the points of criticism one after the other, providing – like Pardies – a diagram of his prism experiment to illustrate his argumentation. Newton's Latin phrases are relativly short and precise in expression, using technical terms likerefractioandrefrangibilitasconstantly and consistently. Newton's critisicm of Pardies' reasoning is, though generally polite, quite direct and succinct (e.g.Sed hallucinatus est Reverendus Pater, p. 4091 orSed consequentiam non video, p. 4093). In the final paragraph, Newton takes issue with the fact that Pardies had called his theory ahypothesis, stating that the properties of light are in his opinion already discovered and easily proven; but in the event that he is wrong, he would rather discard them as a futile and worthless speculation than acknowledge them as his hypothesis (quas iam inventas probare haud difficile existimo et quas si non veras esse cognoscerem, pro futili et inani speculatione mallem repudiare quam pro mea hypothesi agnoscere, p. 4093).This interesting pair of letters by Pardies and Newton shows that even within thePhilosophical Transactions, whose principal language of publication was English, international scientific discussion could still be conducted and printed in Latin. Crucially, Latin was not only the language that the Jesuit Pardies preferred to use in scientific discourse, but Newton reciprocated by using Latin, too.","Harmon; Gross 2007, 22–5","Newton, Isaac‎(← links)A Latin Letter containing some Animadversions upon Mr. Isaac Newton, his Theory of Light‎(← links)","Newton, Isaac:Mr. Newtons Letter, being an Answer to the Letter of P.

Comprising some 800 hexameters, it constitutes an intriguing mix of didactic poetry and satire that leaves the reader in doubt about its ultimate intentions. The Cartesian world system is presented in the form of a dream narrative (a popular vehicle of satire in the wake of Justus Lipsius' Somnium, 1581). Le Coëdic is transported in an arctic region, where he discovers a subterranean microcosmus into which Descartes, who has only feigned his death in Sweden, has retired with some of his devotees. Mersenne guides the author through the palace of Descartes; the tour includes lessions in ballistics, a visit of a workshop where automates are produced, a theatrum anatomicum, vacuum experiments and more. Finally, they meet Descartes himself, who asks the narrator about his reputation in Europe, which is ambiguous: veneration on the one hand, accusations of mental confusion and plagiarism on the other. Descartes reacts with an extended didactic speech. Inter alia, he explains his three kinds of matter, heliocentrism and the solar system. After this, he hands the narrator a super-tele-microscope. The latter ecstatically invokes the Muses and informs the reader about the new insights he gains with the help of this new instrument; among other things, the findings in question regard the tides, the physiology and psychology of vision and the theory of colours. Soon, however, the scenery becomes apocalyptic and the author wakes up, escaping from his dream through a gate of ivory.One important contemporary model for the author was certainly Gabriel Daniel's SJVoyage du monde de Descartes(Paris 1690), a satirical novel which recounts a journey to the Cartesian World with similar protagonists, which was reprinted several times and translated into several languages, i.a. Latin (Iter per mundum Cartesii, Amsterdam 1694; Vienna 1720/21).","Haskell 2003, 166-175","Poemata didascalica‎(← links)le Coëdic, Pierre‎(← links)De homine‎(← links)Iter per mundum Cartesii‎(← links)","le Coëdic, Pierre:Mundus Cartesii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Mundus_Cartesii(last revision: 13.09.2023).","Descartes’ unterirdische Welt erinnert stark an Holbergs Iter!

Marius was born in the Nuremberg area and quickly showed talent in mathematics. Thanks to the patronage of senior officials of Ansbach, mainly of the Malgrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach George, he went to Prague to study underBraheand Frisius. After that, Marius moved to Padua to study medicine. He got some weight in the intellectual circles in Italy and started supervising students on his own. One of these was Baldassarre Capra, who later composed a treatise on the military compass, which he had, in fact, plagiarised fromGalileo. In the Capra-Galileo debate, Marius took his former student's side, which eventually had long-standing consequences for him and his reputation.In 1609, as Marius states in the introduction to theMundus Iovialis, he started investigating the ""planets"" surrounding Jupiter with the use of a telescope produced in Belgium. Since Marius used the Julian calendar, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar, his observations were made in January 1610. In 1611, he published his first findings in a local almanack. The expanded version came out in 1614 and contained short descriptions of the observations as well as a long letter to the ""candid reader"". What Marius tried to achieve with the preface is to defend himself against plagiarism charges. In 1610, Galileo published theSidereus nuntius, where the Italian astronomer provided, among other things, the first-ever description of Jupiter's moons. Comparing the chronology of the two descriptions, it becomes now clear that Marius observed the same phenomenon one day after Galileo's discovery. However, considering that Marius waited four years before making his observations available for a broader audience and that he was unintentionally involved in the Capra-Galileo plagiarism debate, he decided to prevent further issues by complementing the mathematical part of the treatise with the introductory letter.
The task determines the way in which Marius structures his preface. He continuously claims that his writing aims at deepening the knowledge on Jupiter and its moons and does not challenge Galileo, whom he thanks for publishing theSidereus nuntius. Apart from stressing that he stands on the shoulders of astronomical giants, such asKepler,BraheandGalileo, Marius states that he shared his findings with some of his colleagues, who could, apparently, testify in order to clear him of plagiarism. Thus, he mentions that on a good and bright day, he invited Lucas Brunnius, a mathematician from Saxony, to observe the astronomical phenomena, and Lucas did so with great admiration. For the same reason, Marius provides a detailed list of mathematical calculations, which he puts at the end of his treatise.
However, all these precautions had no effect. Galileo attacked Marius sometimes using strong language, undermining his opponent's achievements and claiming that Marius had simply replicated his findings. For Marius, this had significant repercussions: his reputation as an astronomer was ruined entirely. Only at the beginning of the twentieth century was it reinstated in light of the studies that convincingly demonstrated that Marius had discovered Jupiter's moons independently of Galileo. Nowadays, the Jupiter satellites -Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto- are named following Marius's, not Galileo's description.",,"Marius, Simon‎(← links)Io, Europa, Ganymedes puer atque Calisto‎(← links)","Marius, Simon:Mundus Iovialis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Mundus_Iovialis(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,JL,Yes,OA,

It was written during Linnaeus’s stay at George Cliffort’s summer residence Hartecamp near Haarlem. Cliffort had a rich collection of plants in his gardens and Linnaeus was employed to write a detailed description of it, the so-calledHortus Cliffortianus. Moreover, Linnaeus wrote thisMusa Cliffortianaabout Cliffort’s banana. The work opens with the dedicationUt floreant Musaethat is probably a word play as the most common name for the banana at this time was (and still is the name of the biological genus)Musa. This is derived from Arabic but homonym toMusa, the Muse. Hence, the dedication could mean “the Muses” or “the bananas” or even “this work titledMusa” shall flourish”. In the main treatise (p. 5 f.), Linnaeus states thatMusais in fact derived from Arabic, but as botanists despise vernacular words and replace them with Latin or Greek words, he could either get rid of the name or use another etymology (cum autem botanici fere omnes in consuetudine habuere nomina plantis imponenda e Graeca vel Latina lingua desumere, atque peregrina ex aliis linguis oriunda nomina dispungere, aliaque in eorum locum substituere, necesse erit, ut aut reiciatur hocce nomen vel alia inducatur etymologia). He opts for the latter possibility and presents etymologies that deriveMusafrom the ancient goddess or even better from Antonius Musa, an ancient botanist and Emperor Augustus' personal physician. The paratexts include two dedicatory poems one by Johann Alexander Roell of five dactylic hexameters praising Cliffort and Linnaeus and another very elegant poem in ten Alcaic stanzas (i.e., 40 verses) by Hendrik Snakenburg’s. The last paratext is Linnaeus’s dedicatory letter to George Cifford dated Leiden on 20th of February 1736.A shortintroductioof one and a half pages (the pagination starts here) opens the main text. Linnaeus highlights the strange yet fascinating properties of this exotic plant and summarizes which questions he is going to answer. The treatise is divided into seven main parts subdivided into 35 subchapters that are numbered consecutively. Linnaeus first discusses names of the banana (vernacular and Latin, ancient and recent, including references), and their etymology (see above). Then he deals with the taxonomy (titledTheoretica), followed by a detailed description of the genus and the species, the banana’s biological and ecological properties (habitat, geographic range, blooming period, anatomy [no microscopic observations as Linnaeus states]), and its use in economy, as food and medicine, etc. The last part (Litteraria) is dedicated to the history of human interactions with bananas, early accounts on the plants, and with superstitious beliefs concerning bananas (superstitia et vana).
This is concluded by another dedicationFloreat mea Musa per annos(“My ‘Musa’ shall flourish through times”) corresponding to the opening of the work.

TheMysterium cosmographicumis Kepler's first attempt at bringingCopernicus'sheliocentrismin accordance with cosmography. As its title suggests, it is a cosmographical, that is, a physical or natural philosophical work, enriched by typically astronomical considerations, however. By this unusual approach Kepler exposed himself to two kinds of criticism at the same time: he blurred the borders of astronomy and cosmography and thus broke with a dogma which had existed since antiquity, and he openly proclaimed himself an adherent of the heliocentric world view.From 1589, Kepler had studied theology at the university of Tübingen, which included mathematical and astronomical lectures. His mathematics and astronomy professorMaestlintook care of teaching the merits of Copernican theory. They have been widely recognised by leading astronomers of the time, who in particular appreciated the greater astronomical accuracy it allowed for and whose most important result were the widely usedPrutenic tables. The cosmological implications of Copernicus's model were mostly denied, which resulted in the so-called ""Wittenberg interpretation"" of Copernicus (Voelkel 2001, 22): the heliocentric model is a convenient tool which makes possible more accurate calculations and predictions, but it does not reflect physical reality.Kepler, driven by philosophical and religious interests more than by astronomical and mathematical ones, was ironically sent to Graz for teaching mathematics in 1594. There he abandoned his original plan of becoming a priest because he became convinced to be able to contribute to the glory of God better as an astronomer. His plan of establishing aphysical astronomy, of revealing the plan of the Creator, of God the geometer, became the driving force for all of Kepler's work. In 1595 most of the work for theMysterium cosmographicumwas done. As there was no capable printer to be found in Graz, the work was printed in Tübingen with the aid of Maestlin with whom Kepler maintained an intense correspondence and who was to an unusual degree involved in the printing process. In 1596 the book appeared - without the planned chapter defending Copernicanism against Holy Scripture. This had been prevented by the university authorities of Tübingen.The book is organised as follows. After the titlepage, a poem titledLector amice, salve, and the dedication letter to the Baron of Herberstein and the Styrian Estates, there is a preface followed by 23 chapters and another final poem. Appended to Kepler's work one findsRheticus'sNarratio prima, which was added on the initiative ofMichael Maestlin, who feared that potential readers would be unfamiliar with Copernicus.The book contains two main ideas which were factually incorrect but nevertheless would prove very fruitful in the future.The first is the already mentioned ""polyhedral hypothesis"". Adjusting the thickness of the planetary spheres in the Copernican model, Kepler achieved a nesting of these spheres with intermediate Platonic solids. The differences of the resulting distances from the sun from those obtained by measurements were noticable but reasonably small. Maestlin was inspired by this idea and thought about deriving the distances directly from the nesting of spheres and polyhedra because in his eyes this could overcome an epistemological problem of the Aristotelian framework of astronomy: As it was based on observations, astronomy proceeded from effects to causes. This was calleda posteriorireasoning, while the desirablea priorireasoning would have deduced the effects from the causes. This was the standard procedure in cosmography where certain principles were claimed, from which other propositions followed. Determining orbital distances from the ""polyhedral hypothesis"" would have been such ana priorireasoning.The second idea is the so-called ""motive force hypothesis"" and the core of a very novel idea of physical astronomy: For Kepler, the sun is not only at the center of the universe, it also is responsible for the movement of the planets. It exerts a ""moving force"" (vigor motus) which is stronger near the sun and weaker further away. Kepler compares this force with the light cast by the sun: as light becomes brighter as one moves closer and dimmer as one moves away, so does this newly introduced force.As a consequence from the ""motive force hypothesis"" one could now try to calculate the distances of the planets on the basis of their periods. This was done by Kepler using an erroneous model based on the sine. Only in theHarmonia mundifrom 1619 Kepler had found the correct relation between the period of a planet and its distance. This is now known as Kepler's ""third law"". Within theMysterium cosmographicum, by contrast, the distances calculated from the ""motive force hypothesis"" and from the ""polyhedral hypothesis"" were incompatible. Being aware of this, Kepler modestly called his work aprodromus(""forerunner""). He knew he would have to come up with better explanations. Ultimately, this lead to hisAstronomia nova, published in 1609.Due to these unresolved matters, but mostly because of the unorthodox and in the eyes of many unseemly introduction of physical reasoning into astronomy, the reception of theMysterium cosmographicumwas mostly critical. On the one hand there were theological objections because of allegedly insurmountable discrepancies with the Bible where the sun is supposed to move. On the other hand, astronomers concerned about the intertwining of physics and astronomy, especially regarding the ""motive force hypothesis"", were skeptical as well. Even generally supportive colleagues like Maestlin,Galileo GalileiorTycho Braheraised objections.Kepler was a convinced Copernican and very religious at the same time. To his mind, putting the sun in the middle of the universe was more than a convenient working hypothesis, it was metaphysically justified and almost a religous mission: The sun casts light, brings warmth and surpasses all other celestial objects in brightness and beauty. To Kepler it seemed only natural to think that it is also was the source of motion in the universe. Also the ability of Copernicus's heliocentrism to explain various phenomena by a unified, elegant theory were convincing to him. His creed that ""Nature loves unity and simplicity"" (Amat illa simplicitatem, amat unitatem)[1]was a strong motive for him to embrace heliocentrism.A second edition of theMysterium cosmographicumappeared in 1621 with a foreword by Kepler and only minor changes, even though a great part of the book had already become outdated by Kepler's own findings presented in theAstronomia nova.",Voelkel 2001,"Narratio prima‎(← links)Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Epigramma Ptolemaeo adscriptum‎(← links)Dissertatio cum nuntio sidereo‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes:Mysterium cosmographicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Mysterium_cosmographicum(last revision: 25.04.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,FB,

They had been spread by a manuscript calledCommentarioluswith which Copernicus had tested probable reactions of astronomers concerning his heliocentric ideas. Ultimately, this lead to Rheticus's journey to Frombork (Frauenburg) in 1539, where Copernicus was a canon. There he could study Copernicus's unpublished work and finished his manuscript of theNarratio primaafter only ten weeks working time yielding the first printed version of Copernican theory in 1540.TheNarratio primatakes the form of a quite extensive open letter to the Franconian mathematicianJohannes Schöner, an older friend of the author. At the beginning, Rheticus confesses that he has only understood books 1–3 ofDe revolutionibuscompletely so far and announces to focus his presentation on book 3. The passage that is decisive from a modern point of view is found on fol. Ciijr:Qui [motus] est, ut sol universi medium occupet, terra autem loco solis in eccentrico, quem orbem magnum appellare placuit, circumferatur.(""This [movement] is as follows: The sun occupies the centre of the universe. Instead of the sun, the earth revolves on an orbit which Copernicus decided to call 'great circle'."")Appended to the main text, one finds a short eulogy of Prussia which culminates in the praise of Copernicus and other Prussian patrons of Rheticus. Henricus Zeellius (Heinrich Zell), a cartographer who had travelled with Rheticus to Frombork and appears to have been involved in the printing process, adds a list of translations of all Greek terms usedob maiorem auctoritatem(""because they carry greater weight"") in theNarratio prima.The letter proved quite successful and apparently helped to overcome Copernicus's reluctance to publish his opus magnum. TheNarratio primawas less technical and thus easier to understand for a broader audience, it had an important role in propagating the heliocentric model. It therefore was frequently reprinted until the 17th century. Among these editions there is the 1541 Basel edition and a notable one byMaestlinappended toKepler'sMysterium cosmographicum. Furthermore, theNarratio primareceived a number of modern editions and translations (see ""References"").","Prowe 1884, 285–366Zeller 1943Hugonnard-Roche et al. 1982Danielson 2006Schöbi-Fink 2010Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 11, 395-397","De revolutionibus orbium coelestium‎(← links)Rheticus, Georg Joachim‎(← links)Oratio de astronomia et geographia‎(← links)Mysterium cosmographicum‎(← links)","Rheticus, Georg Joachim:Narratio prima, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Narratio_prima(last revision: 02.12.2021).",,"JL, FB",Yes,"JL, FB",

Poema medicum, cui praemittitur dissertatio epistolaris prosaica eiusdem argumenti.",,1740,York,"Ward, Chandler",18th century,"Letter, Didactic poem",Medicine,Neuropathia(Google Books),604890,"This didactic epic in three books, the first published work of the gifted Scottish physician and writer Malcolm Flemyng, treats a mental illness that to some degree overlaps with our depression and was called, in the author's days,hypochondriain men andhysteriain women. Flemyng, by contrast, insists that the disease is the same in both sexes and should only bear one name accordingly. His own suggestion,neuropathia(""ailment of the nerves""), hints at his aetiology which is connected to the nerves transmitting signals to and from the brain. According to him, this transmission takes place with the help of a special fluid circulating within the tube-like nerves. If a defective concoction affects the composition of this fluid,neuropathiais the result.TheNeuropathiais logically divided into three books concerned with the emergence, the symptoms and the treatment of the disease respectively. Stilistically, Flemyng follows the model of Lucretius, as already intimated by the motto on the title page, taken fromDe rerum natura1.943–949. While this is a common choice in early modern didactic epic in general, it is especially appropriate in the present case: Just like Lucretius, Flemyng wants to save mankind from mental suffering. Moreover, the biographical tradition ascribes a mental illness to Lucretius himself, which according to some versions even led to his suicide. When Flemyng declares thatneuropathiabestows extraordinary mental capacities on some of its victims (2.338–341), this is almost certainly meant as a nod towards Lucretius.The poem is introduced by a short note to the reader which excuses any imperfections with difficult circumstances of composition and draws attention to the fact that Flemyng had been a pupil of the famous Herman Boerhaave. Moreover, it is preceded by a long prose letter to the physician Peter Shaw on the very same subject ofneuropathia– a striking instance of the custom to accompany didactic poems by explanatory paratexts such as marginalia and paratexts in order to  make sure that readers can understand them.The work apparently aroused considerable interest.

"Fatio de Duillier, Nicolas",Nicolai Facii Duillierii Neutonus ecloga,,1728,Oxford,Theatrum Sheldonianum (Oxford),18th century,Panegyric poem,"Physics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography, Alchemy/Chemistry",Download PDF(Transcript),not available,"Written by Isaac Newton's younger friend and admiror, the Swiss mathematician and astronomer Nicolas Fatio de Duiller, this eclogue belongs to the more interestings specimens of the panegyric poetry on the great physicist that appeared, beginning with Edmund Halley's introductory poem to thePrincipia, during the late 17th and 18th centuries both in Latin and the vernaculars. The work, which comprises 117 hexameters, was first published in the JournalThe Present State of the Republick of Letters, apparently on the occasion of the first anniversary of Newton's death (20th of March 1728). One month later, the author published it as a separate little pamphlet. This second edition (on which the present description is based) is preceded by four enigmatic hexameters in which Typhon dismembers the poet but Isis puts him together again – presumably a defense against malicious critics – and by a note providing some biographical information that is used in the text itself (Newton was born in a Christmas night at full moon, and his hair grew white between his thirtieth and fortieth year).TheEclogastarts from an invocation of Nature and from the announcement to write in a veiled, allegorical mode, just as Nature itself likes to veil its secrets (1–5). One day, Phoebus has just risen when he recognizes that everything is unusually calm and none of the gods is to be seen. He decides to investigate the matter and descends to earth, where he finds all the Olympian and lesser gods gathered at the foot of a high mountain (6–31). The Muses sing a hymn to Nature and announce that the boy who has been due to her since long ago has finally been born (32–48). Athene claims the boy, whom she hands to Venus for breastfeeding, for herself, but Phoebus corrects her: The boy will decide himself which gods he is interested in. The gods crown the boy with a garland of flowers and laurel (49–60). Jupiter welcomes Phoebus, who cannot be missed at such an occasion, and asks him to read out a prophecy that is written on tables of diamond (61–67). Phoebus promptly recites what basically amounts to a list of Newton's future achievements (analysis of light, discovery of gravity, dismissal of the Cartesian theory of vortices, understanding of the path of comets, determination of the mass of the planets, explanation of the tides and in general mathematisation of Nature, 68–92). While the other gods applaud, Mercury steals the wreath from the boy's head. Phoebus, who is the only one to notice, ponders what this sinister omen may mean for Newton's future, but for the moment, he just replaces the wreath with a completely white one. The boy is also adorned with precious earrings and the festive atmosphere remains undisturbed. Finally, the gods ascend to heaven again and leave the boy on earth, where he shall nonetheless be nourished with divine food, viz., nectar and ambrosia (93–117).Duillier presents his praise of Newton as a vivid, dramatic narrative, half of which takes the form of direct speech. The celebration of the birth of apuerwith extraordinary abilities in aneclogarecalls Virgil's fourth eclogue, an association underscored by numerous details such as the newborn's smile at v. 54 (cf. Virgil, ecl. 4.60–63). The date of Newton's birthday, highlighted in the introductory note, moreover elevates him to the status of a second Christ – an unusually extravagant form of praise. As indicated in the opening lines, the poem is conceived as an extended allegory, which is often difficult to decipher. An astrological, alchemical and millenarian subtext appears plausible from a reading of the poem itself as well as from Newton's and Duillier's alchemical interests and the latter's involvement with the so-called ""French prophets"". However, a thorough analysis along these lines as well as regarding more or less hidden references to Newton's biography remains a desideratum despite the valuable attempts ofFigala; Petzold 1987. In any case, the personal and at the same time multi-layeredEclogaconstitutes an engaging tribute to Newton.Despite the poem's merits, it remained largely unknown in its own time.

The inscription is placed on the base of Newton's gorgeous tomb monument there, which shows the hero resting on four of his books (two of which are probably thePrincipiaand theOpticks, while the identity of the other two is unclear), surrounded by putti playing with scientific instruments and under a celestial globe above which sits enthroned Urania, the Muse of astronomy.The text makes no direct reference to the sculptures of the monument. After the introductory phrase ""Here lies Isaac Newton, Knight Bachelor"", it focuses on the enumeration of Newton's major achievements. This is done in the form of a clearly articulated relative phrase, whose four parts decrease in length and importance but are otherwise strictly parallel, with the verb at the end in each case: Newton explained  the solar system in thePrincipia, the nature of light  in theOpticks, contributed to God's glory also by his chronological and biblical studies, and led a life of apostolic simplicity. Such a grammatical and stylistic arrangement is typical of early modern honorary inscriptions (in fact, it can even be found today in honorary degree diplomas, occasionally still issued in Latin). Set a little apart from the rest of the epitaph, there follows an invitation to humankind to rejoice because such a genius has walked the earth. The epitaph is concluded by Newton's dates of birth and death (old style).In terms of layout, it is noteworthy that only the first and last lines of the text are in the monumentalcapitalis quadratawhich is traditional for inscriptions, while the rest is in a kind of antiqua typeface. Epigraphic abbreviations are likewise confined to beginning and end. In accordance with common epigraphic practice, all lines are centered.Newton's epitaph documents the exceptional status as the greatest hero of natural science ever which he had acquired since the publication of thePrincipiaand which is also  evidenced, for instance, by Pope's epigram on him (seeEpitaphium in Newtonum).

This first-ever translation of Nicander is a typical specimen of the half a dozen Latin (and French) 16th century versions of the Greek poet (Santamaría Hernández 2004) in some respects and an atypical one in others. As most of his followers, Lonicer sees Nicander not only as a poet (as he is understood today), but in the first place as a doctor, and heavily annotates his verse along these lines. Contrary to his followers, however, Lonicer himself is no doctor, and he translates not into hexameters, but into prose.The book opens with a letter of dedication to Johann Feige (Iohannes Ficinus a Liechtenau), the powerful chancellor of the Landgraviate of Hesse. This letter mainly contains praise of Nicander (underscored by a collection of ancient testimonies about his life and writings), an exposition and justification of Lonicer's treatment of the text, praise of Feige and pleas to him to protect the work from unfair critics and back it up with his great authority. A certain Renhardus Hadamarius extolls Lonicer's translation in turn in seven elegiac couplets.In the translation itself, Lonicer takes care to convey the text's poetic colour in his prose by verbally translating Nicander's circumlocutions and preserving his epithets. Nicander's text is interspersed with Lonicer's commentary, which is printed in smaller font and partly paraphrases the ancient scholia transmitted together with the text. In addition, frequent marginalia disclose the poem's structure and adduce parallels from other ancient pharmacological writers, esp.Dioscurides.In the dedication, Lonicer also suggests  that a capable poet should produce a metrical translation of Nicander. This proposal was heeded as soon as the very next year, when Lonicer's friend Euricius Cordus published his poetic version in Frankfurt, taking Lonicer's translation as a guideline (praevium secutus interpretem, licet non ubique servatis eius vestigiis, fol.

In the early modern era, Homer was still imagined as a man of abundant knowledge, the traces of which can be found in his poems. Consequently, scientific readings of theIliadand theOdysseyare not at all uncommon. Testaments to this practice exist at universities (cf. the dissertationDe Homero medico) as well as in academies. TheSolitary Nightsof Giovanni Battista Persona, a philosopher and physician from Bergamo, are a collection of seventy dialogues on scientific passages in theOdyssey. These dialogues are not fictional, but have a historical background: they are literarized versions of a reading project of theAcademia Solitudinis(Accademia della Solitudine). Persona states in the preface that he was present at all of their conversations, which took place in his house, and gives a good impression of how theOdysseywas read and discussed in these meetings.The background of the book also also explains the titleNoctes solitariae. It combines an allusion to Aulus Gellius'sNoctes Atticae, a famous ancient example ofBuntschriftstellerei, which presents a wide range of topics without systematical order, and an allusion to the ""Academy of Solitude"". The names of the six characters discussing theOdyssey, Inclusus, Siticulosus, Providus, Anonymus, Ingeniosus, and Tutus, are pseudonyms used in the academy. In the preface, Persona reveals their real names: Odoardo Micheli, Bernardino Pietrogallo, Orazio Patinio, Giovanni Licinio, Giovanni Antonio Moroni and Gabriele Rotini.When the subtitle points to the passages of theOdysseywhich arescientifice scripta, this  does not yet refer to the natural sciences, but to a knowledge encompassing theology, ethics, natural philosophy, astronomy, medicine, history and philology, among other things. However, there are many dialogues concerned with scientific topics in the modern sense, for example the identity of the plantnepenthes(no. 13), the warmth of light (no. 24), the role of experience (no. 32),  or the cause of seasickness (no. 35). The length of the dialogues varies between two or three pages and more than ten pages.While each of the seventy selected passages is discussed in the form of a dialogue, together, they form  a scientific commentary on theOdyssey. The commentary element is also stressed by typographical layout of the chapters: a heading with the exact reference to the book and verse number, followed by the verses which form the textual basis of the ensuing dialogue. Interestingly, theOdysseyis cited not in Greek, but in a Latin word-by-word translation. In the preface, Persona admits that a translation into Latin hexameters would be more beautiful, but argues that a translationad verbumis a better basis for scientific discussion. A table of dialogue topics as well as a detailedindex rerumindicate that the book was intended not only for linear reading, but also accommodated readers who wanted to jump between dialogues according to their personal interests.Although theSolitary Nightsdid not see a second edition, they are an intriguing example of Neo-Latin scientific literature in many ways: in terms of genre, as a combination of dialogue and commentary, in terms of approach, as a scientific reading of a literary text, and in terms of mediality, as an oral practice put into writing and spread by the printing press.","Wallura 2020, 667–668 (esp. on the dialogue on the plantnepenthes)","De Homero medico‎(← links)Persona, Giovanni Battista‎(← links)","Persona, Giovanni Battista:Noctes solitariae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Noctes_solitariae(last revision: 10.06.2021).",,,Yes,IT,

The first part is dealing with marine animals, the second with animals of the freshwater. The work does not only cover fish but basically any animal species that live in or around the water including mammals, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, etc. There are also some fantastic sea animals on the pages following p. 173 that look like terrestrial animals or humans (sequuntur monstra quaedam cetaceae beluarum terrestrium aut hominis aliqua specie).The first part is opened by a dedicatory letter to the Austrian Archduke and later Emperor Maximilian II. In the letter to the reader, Gessner mentions his other important zoological works, theHistoria animaliumand the differentIcones animalium, and highlights the differences to the present work, that is the focus on names. Gessner mentions the great abundance of vernacular synonyms of water animals although he states that there are not always ancient Greek or Latin names for certain species, for those of the freshwaters far away from the Mediterranean in particular. He was therefore forced to come up with some new Latin words, but thinks that he was allowed to do so (Licere autem ab homine in rerum natura exercitato nomina, ubi desint, apte et significanter confingi; fol. aa 4r). He has, however, marked such newly coined names with the letter “F.” (fictum).

In the dedicatory letter to Philip William, Prince of Orange, Junius highlights the importance of good education especially in the early years. According to his own experience as student and as teacher, one of the biggest challenges is to find and use the correct vocabulary (nullam maiorem in litteris difficultatem expertus esse mihi videor quam in reddendis propriis rerum nominibus; fol. 2v). He thinks, however, that the people tend to neglect the correct use and learning of vocabulary and that they resort to much too general words or even use words taken from the vernaculars. Sometimes they even remain speechless because they cannot find a proper word to express their ideas (fol. 3r). Junius presents his new lexicon as a remedy for this speechlessness and 'barbaric' use of vocabulary.The dedicatory letter is followed by a poem of 29 iambic trimeters dedicated again to Philip William. Then follows an overview of authors that Junius has consulted as references for his lexicon. This list is ordered according to discipline and alphabetically within these categories. There are mostly ancient Greek and Latin authors but also some more recent ones listed under the headingrecentiores. After this, Junius gives an overview of emendations of ancient texts that he has proposed in his lexicon together with the page and the column where to find it. 
The lexicon itself is ordered according to topics and within these topics similar lemmata are next to each other. Sometimes there is also an alphabetical order if there are many similar items (like different kinds of birds). A table of content at the beginning and an alphabetical index at the end help to find topics and entries. There is a broad spectrum of topics covered, ranging from natural things like the human body, animals, plants, or minerals, to crafts like architecture, nautics, measurements, cuisine, painting, music, and hunting to certain social contexts like military, church, and even swearwords (infamia). Junius begins with books and related things on purpose because of the eminent importance of books for learning (he describes books asmagistri quasi muti).
The pages of the lexicon are printed in two columns. The single entries begin with the Latin word, often followed by references to its use in literature. Then there are translations in different languages in the following order: Ancient Greek, German (shortenedAl.forAlamanice vel Alamanis>), Dutch (shortened B. forBelgice vel Belgis), French (shortenedG.forGallice vel Gallis), Italian (shortenedIt.forItalice vel Italis), Spanish (shortenedH.forHispanice vel Hispanis), and English (shortenedAn.forAnglice vel Anglis).

One of these combinations is the author portrait, accompanied by a laudatory epigram which often comments on the relationship between the visual representation and the intellectual capacities of the person portrayed. In the rich paratext toUlisse Aldrovandi’sOrnithologiaof 1599, one can find a sheet presenting an engraving with the author’s portait in an oval frame in the centre. The portrait is surrounded by an inscription giving the name, origin, and age of the author (Ulysses Aldrovandus Bononiensis anno aetatis LXXVIII., “Ulisse Aldrovandi from Bologna, at the age of 77""). The fact that this engraving was coloured in some copies may indicate the importance of such portraits in the eyes of the readers.The author's image interacts closely with the elegiac couplet by his student Johannes Cornelius Uterverius, which presents Aldrovandi’s portrait to the ancient authority Aristotle:Non tua, Aristoteles, haec est, sed Ulyssis imago,dissimiles vultus, par tamen ingenium“This is not your portrait, Aristotle, but the one of Ulysses: you look different, but you are equal in intellect.”The poet implies that Aristotle would have expected to find a picture of himself in this volume. Instead, he is confronted with a different face, which, however, depicts a second, contemporary Aristotle (it must be stressed that the poet claims equality, not superiority over Aristotle). Through the lens of the epigram, Aldrovandi’s portrait thus becomes a portrait of Aldrovandi as Aristotle.The oval frame in the centre of the page is surrounded by a selection of animals and plants, i.e. Aldrovandi’s (and Aristotle’s) objects of study. This “forms the basis of Aldrovandi’s claim that he has inherited the intellect of Aristotle” (Findlen 1996, 311). Another scroll at the very bottom of the engraving exhibits a motto taken from Vergil’s third eclogue (sensibus haec imis – res est non parva – reponas, “pay close attention to this – it is no small matter”), referring either to the composition of the engraving or the book that is about to follow when the reader turns the page.","Findlen 1994, 309–311","Uterverius, Johannes Cornelius‎(← links)Si quibus est lectis mea cognita fama libellis (author portrait)‎(← links)","Uterverius, Johannes Cornelius:Non tua, Aristoteles (author portrait), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Non_tua,_Aristoteles_(author_portrait)(last revision: 16.01.2023).",,"MK, IT",,IT,
"Kirsten, Michael","Non-entia chymica sive catalogus eorum operum operationumque chymicarum, quae, cum non sint in rerum natura nec esse possint, magno tamen cum strepitu a vulgo chymicorum passim circumferuntur et orbi obtruduntur",,1645,Frankfurt am Main,"Götze, Thomas Matthias",17th century,"Monograph, Dictionary/Lexicon, Other (see description)",Alchemy/Chemistry,Non-entia chymica(Google Books),732035,"The ascription of this booklet of 35 duodecimo pages aboutChemical Nonentitiesto the Bohemian physician and mathematician Michael Kirsten (Holzmann; Bohatta 1902–1928, vol. 3, 215) is conjectural. The title page bears no name, and the author calls himself Utis at the end of the preface to the reader (p. 3) – a Greek pseudonym meaning ""Nobody"", first used by cunning Ulysses to deceive the murderous Cyclops Polyphemus.The preface itself (pp. 3–13) goes to some lengths to justify the work's purpose and title. In an extended comparison, alchemists are likened to poets, with whom they share a fertile imagination and the ability to invent things that do not and cannot exist. In contrast to the harmless or even useful poets, however, alchemists waste their fortune on their nonsensical ambitions and plunge themselves and everyone else into disaster. A few of their innumerable absurd contrivances are exposed in the present book for entertainment and to deter people from such mischief.In the main part (pp. 14–34), alchemical non-entities are listed in italics, followed by short, neutral or seemingly laudatory explanations in normal type. Kirsten groups his nonentities thematically in the following chapters:Chemical nonentities from plants(pp. 14–16),Nonentities from animals(pp. 16–17),Nonentities from stones(pp. 17–19),Nonentities from minerals(subdivided into sections:From vitriol,From antimony, etc; pp. 20–26),Nonentities from metals(again subdivided into sections; pp. 26–31),Some common nonentities(pp. 31–32) andNonentities concerning the transmutation of metals(pp. 32–34). Within the single chapters and subjections, no alphabetical or thematical order is discernible. A typical entry reads as follows (p. 20):Anima vitrioliaquae summae (in qua dissolutum est vitriolum) innatans et inde abstracta philosophiceque praeparata: mysterium in morbis gravissimis.""Soul of vitriol, floating on the surface of water in which vitriol has been dissolved, skimmed and prepared in a philosophical manner: an arcane remedy against the most severe diseases.""At the end (pp. 34–35), Kirsten asserts in a shortExcusatio(""Apology"") that he does not want to hurt anybody in person. Whoever feels offended is ipso facto culpable himself.In terms of genre,Chemical Nonentitiesis difficult to classify. One could perhaps call it a short and unsystematic dictionary or encyclopedia. With regard to content, the work belongs to the large field of scientific polemic, which was not always directed against individuals, but could also attack entire disciplines (such as astrology, see Pico della Mirandola'sDisputationes adversus astrologiam divinatricem) and their practitioners. As a polemical lexicon, Kirsten's book reminds one of a much later, contentually unrelated work, Gustave Flaubert'sDictionnaire des idées reçues.Readers seem to have enjoyed Kirsten's laconic and elegant criticism of exaggerated alchemical claims. The work was reprinted twice, in 1670 and in 1674. Its idiosyncratic title possibly inspired Werner Rolfinck'sNon ens chimicum(1670). The phrase was also adopted by Robert Boyle in hisExperiments and Notes about the Producibleness of Chymicall Principles(1680; seePrincipe 1998, 55).",,"Kirsten, Michael‎(← links)","Kirsten, Michael:Non-entia chymica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Non-entia_chymica(last revision: 22.09.2021).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

In Averoldi’s highly rhetorized poem of eight elegiac couplets, this comparison results in a hyperbolical praise of Bongo. The poem abounds in rhetorical figures such as anaphoras, parallelism, chiasm, antitheses and similes. Pythagoras’ work is to Bongo’s like a drop to the ocean, bronze to gold, clouds to the sun (likely a symbol of the Christian era):Gutta mari, aes auro, cedunt et nubila soli, / Pythagoram Bongo cedere posse negas?(v. 11–2, “The drop yields to the ocean, bronze to gold, and the clouds to the sun: do you deny that Pythagoras can yield to Bongo?”). In a final point, the poet imagines that if Pythagoras (who famously believed in reincarnation and was said to remember his past lives) were reborn, he would want to become Bongo, whose name is rendered in Greek as Βογγαῖος σοφóς (v. 14), and would renounce the title of ruler of Italian wisdom (᾽Ιταλικῆς σοφίας ἄρχων), as he is surpassed by another Italian sage (Italicus sophos, i.e. Bongo).",Ernst 1983,"Numerorum Mysteria‎(← links)Averoldi, Giovanni Andrea‎(← links)","Averoldi, Giovanni Andrea:Noscis opes, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Noscis_opes(last revision: 31.08.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,IT,

Aiming at providing a first sketch of a given field's contents and at the same time at familiarizing readers with the respective terminology, they combine traits of wordbooks, elementary textbooks, and vademecums. The presentInformation about the Mineral Reignbelongs to this class. (For a later text of this kind from another discipline, see Franz Joseph Märter'sFundamenta et termini botanici.) When Jonston on the next-to-last page of the preface to hisNotitia regni botanici(see below) calls that text ahistoriae plantarum prodromus philologicuswhich introduces readers to the basics of classification and terminology, this characterization can mutatis mutandis be transferred to the present work as well. At least one reader actually tried to learn geological terminology from theInformation about the Mineral Reign, as he underlined almost every name of a mineral in the book.Jonston's text features a short dedication to the jurist Martin Bernhard, counselor and secretary to Ludwig IV., Duke of Silesia, in which he calls his work anamicitiae tessera(""pledge of friendship""). Otherwise, there are no introductory paratexts. At the end, one finds a table of contents and an index which makes good for the non-alphabetic arrangement of the material in the text itself.The main text comprises about one hundred duodecimo pages. It is divided into twotitulidedicated to things that come forth from the earth spontaneously (pp. 3–6) and others that must be dug out (pp. 6–101). The latter, far longer part is subdivided into five chapters discussing kinds of earth (terrae), hardened liquids (succi concreti), petroleum and related products (bitumina), stones (lapides) and metals (metalla). The stone chapter (pp. 32–86) alone takes up more than half of the work's total length. Within the chapters, further subdivisions occur. At the lowest level, the work consists of brief descriptions of different kinds of minerals, often numbered in Arabic numerals. The designations of the respective substances are set apart by italics from the descriptive text in which they are embedded. An average specimen of such an entry reads as follows (p. 40):Topazius recentiorum, siorientalis, auro purissimo instar rutilat, solo adamante minus durior; sioccidentalis, cum auro parum nigricat, chrystallo mollior.The stone calledtopaz by the modernshas a reddish glow like the purest gold in itseastern varietyand is less hard than diamond only; in itswestern variety, he shows a little black along with the golden colour and is waxier than crystal.In the same year of publication 1661 and with the same printer and publisher, Jonston also released aNotitia regni vegetabilis, which closely resembles the present work in its make while being three times as long.

After replacing matter and form that were considered the two primary substances in  Aristotle's natural philosophical system with light, Patrizi shows how the divine and intelligible light emanates throughout the universe. The process is reflected in the treatise's structure: while in the two first parts, thePanaugiaand thePanarchia, Patrizi sets up the grounds for his natural philosophy, in Part III (thePampsychia), he works through the concept of the soul, and Part IV (thePancosmia), which is the most interesting from a scientific perspective, explores natural effects in the terrestrial world. It is worth noting that, in principle, Patrizi does not search for a proper and truly scientific and experimental explanation of the described effects. Instead, he mostly refers to natural philosophical arguments, which, in his view, should eventually eliminate the foundations of the Aristotelian natural philosophical system.

The frontispiece of the book (signed with an earlier date) displays an alternative title,Redivivi Heronis nova et amoenior de fontibus philosophia(New and Lovelier Philosophy of Hero, Restored to Life, about Fountains), referencing Dobrzensky's ancient model Hero of Alexandria. In the preface to the reader, Dobrzensky defends his title against possible accusations of arrogance. He also states that theNew and Lovelier Philosophyis a prodrome to a more comprehensive work, but it seems that this follow-up publication never appeared in print.Even though the book is presented as a preliminary publication, it is amply illustrated with engravings and has a rich paratext consisting of a frontispiece, a dedication letter, a preface to the reader, two tables of contents and two Italian poems. A list of basic terms and another one of basic principles in hydraulics and pneumatics is intended to ease the reader's understanding of the following monograph. The monograph is divided into three parts which are said to mirror the tripartite division of philosophy into logics, physics and metaphysics. The parts are further divided into propositions. The first part,De natura liquidi et principiis fontium, deals with the origin of fountain and the nature and natural properties of water, with a digression on the much-discussed vacuum (pp. 1-42). The second part,De variis fontium classibus et ideis(pp. 43-78) then turns to artificial fountains and defines five principles to make water rise high (natural fall, attraction and expulsion of water, compression and rarefaction of air), featuring several concrete designs in text and engraving. The third part,Thaumaturgus hydrotechnicus(pp. 79-121), exhibits further water artifices and wonderful properties of water. According to the preface to the reader, the second part is the heart of theNew and Lovelier Philosophy, and the other parts were added so that the book would be neither too short or shapeless.In terms of literary form and style, theNew and Lovelier Philosophyis many-faceted, ranging from proems to construction manuals, from vivid anecdotes from his own life to letters by others inserted into the text. Sometimes the author cannot resist to play with the water vocabulary suggested by his subject: For example, in the proem of the second part, he announces that he has ""flowed down"" (defluamus) to the topic of artificial fountains. In the proem of the third, he states that this part was suggested to him by some murmur of the waves:nescio quis tenuis undarum susurrus mihi aurem vellicat) and notes about his choice of clear expressions:neque enim decet, ut, dum de lene perspicueque fluente aquarum radio disseritur, asperior et turbidior fluat oratio(""For it is not proper that, while one treats the gently and transparently flowing stream of water, the speech should flow more roughly and more murkily"").This prodrome remained the only work on fountains Dobrzensky would publish, despite his announcement that a more elaborate publication would follow.",,"Dobrzensky, Jacobus Johannes Wenceslaus‎(← links)","Dobrzensky, Jacobus Johannes Wenceslaus:Nova et amoenior de admirando fontium genio philosophia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Nova_et_amoenior_de_admirando_fontium_genio_philosophia(last revision: 29.11.2021).","The engraving caused a delay in publication (cf. preface to the reader).For the most part, the work does not deal with theoretical science per se but with its practical (hydrodynamical) applications.",,Yes,IT,

The present specimen by Leibniz presumably is the most influential of all such contributions. Before 1636,Pierre de Fermathad developed hisMethodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimamwhich circulated in manuscript form until its posthumous publication in 1679 but was largely restricted to polynomials. Leibniz takes the next step with hisNova methoduswhose full title gives a clear idea of what the paper is about:A New Method Applicable to Maxima, Minima, and also Tangents, Which Does Not Care about Fractions and Irrational Quantities, and a Unique Kind of Calculation for Them. In fact, this is the first of three papers in which Leibniz presents the calculus invented by him (and, simultaneously but independently, byNewton).The paper neatly falls into two parts. The first (pp. 467–469) introduces, with reference to a preceding table of diagrams, the notion and notation of differentials. Thedifferentialdyis defined with the help of an arbitrary number dxsuch that the quotient dy/dxequals the slope of the tangent. The problematic part of this is the lack of a suitable tangent definition. On p. 470 finding a tangent is only described as drawing a line connecting two infinitely close points on a polygon with an infinite number of sides (infinitangulum). Using this definition, Leibniz provides some basic rules for reckoning with differentials. Notably, it shows that the derivative of a constant function is zero, the constant factor rule, the sum, subtraction, product and quotient rule and later also rules for powers and roots. The deductions of the respective formulas are not given, nor is the purpose of the procedure explained. The latter aspect, however, is made good for in the second part (pp. 469–473), where Leibniz is proudly outspoken about the usefulness and power of his new method. He thinks it superior to anything available so far and even claims that it marks the beginning of a new era in the history of geometry, because it will lift the discipline as a whole to a higher level and enable it to tackle problems in applied mathematics unsolvable to date (pp. 472–473):Et haec quidem initia sunt tantum geometriae cuiusdam multo sublimioris, ad difficillima et pulcherrima quaeque etiam mixtae matheseos problemata pertingentis, quae sine calculo nostro differentiali aut simili non temere quisquam pari facilitate tractabit.To back up his assertions, Leibniz presents three examples of its application: he uses it to deduce Snell's law, to find a curve defined by the condition that the sum of the distances of each point on it from any number of other points on a straight line be equal, and to solve a geometrical problem which had eluded even Descartes: To find a curve with constant subtangent – the result is an exponential function.The paper is groundbreaking not only regarding its content, but also in its terminology and mathematical notation. Leibniz explicitly introduces a technical term for his new method, when he writes at the beginning of the second part (p. 469):Ex cognito hoc algorithmo, ut ita dicam, calculi huius, quem vocodifferentialem,omnes aliae aequationes differentiales inveniri possunt per calculum communem…Once this algorithm, so to say, of this calculation, which I calldifferential, is known, all other differential equations can be found by normal calculation…He thus creates the expression ""differential calculus"", by which his method is designated until the present day. Some other coinages found in the article have not remained in use, but are chosen so aptly that their meaning is nonetheless understood immediately . An inflection point of a curve, for instance, is called apunctum flexus contrarii, literally a ""point of bend to the other side"" (p. 468). To state that a curve is the same as a polygon with infinitely many sides and angles, Leibniz boldly invents the compound adjectiveinfinitangulum(p. 470). His most important innovation in terms of notation is ""d"" (as in dx, dy) to indicate a small interval (p. 467). Leibniz also introduces the plus-minus and minus-plus signs (±, ∓), which he callssigna ambigua(""ambiguous signs"") and whose relationship within one and the same formula he explains as follows (p. 468):Significat autem ∓ contrarium ipsius ±, ut si hoc sit + illus sit – vel contra.(""But ∓ means the contrary of ±, so that if the second is +, the first is –, and contrariwise."") By contrast, he does not use the equality sign (=), but writesaequ.(that is,aequum, ""equal"", oraequatur, ""becomes equal"") instead.","Struik 1969, 270–280 (translation with introduction and notes)Edwards 1979, 258–260Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 386","Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm‎(← links)Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis‎(← links)","Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm:Nova methodus pro maximis et minimis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Nova_methodus_pro_maximis_et_minimis(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

"Addison, Joseph",Oratio. Nova philosophia veteri praeferenda est,Theatri Oxoniensis encaenia sive comitia philologica Julii 7. anno 1693. celebrata,1693,Oxford,,17th century,Oration,"Physics, Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography","Nova philosophia veteri praeferenda est(inThe Altar of Love, London 1727) (Google Books)",732899,"During the Oxford encaenia of 1693, the 21-year-old student Joseph Addison gave a Latin speech in the Sheldonian theatre that vigorously attacked Aristotelianism and advertised the new philosophy (science) of Descartes. Addison's oration  was subsequently printed in theTheatri Oxoniensis encaenia sive comitia philologica Julii 7 anno 1693(fol. L2v–M1v). In this collection, Addison'sNova philosophia veteri praeferenda est(""The new philosophy must be preferred to the old"") is followed by two other Latin orations that were delivered at the same encaenia by two of Addison's Oxford colleagues, Richard Smallbrook and Edward Taylor, titledVetus philosophia novae praeferenda est(""The old philosophy must be preferred to the new"", fol. M1v–N1v) andQuaeritur utrum vetus philosophia an nova sit praeferenda(""The question is whether the old or the new philosophy must be preferred"", fol. N2r–N2v). Together, the three orations thus represent the debate of old versus new philosophy (unfortunately, there is no digital copy of the 1693 volume).Addison's short oration is a lively piece in Ciceronian style, full of enthusiatic praise and acerbic wit. Not by coincidence, it starts with a deliberate echo of Cicero's first Catilinarian oration, picking up Cicero's first wordquousque(""for how long""): as Cicero had confronted Catilina by asking him for how long he would continue to abuse their patience, Addison confronts his audience by asking them for how long they will continue to follow the old philosophy:Quousque veterum vestigiis serviliter insistemus, academici, nec ultra patres sapere audebimus?(""For how long will we follow slavishly the footsteps of the ancients, academics, and won't dare to understand more than our fathers?"") Addison praises Descartes enthusiastically as the one who introduced the new kind of philosophy and exalts the progress of philosophy manifest in astronomy, microscopy and vacuum experiments. In front of this foil, he attacks Aristotle who ""left nothing untouched except the truth"" (nihil intactum, nihil illibatum reliquit praeter ipsam veritatem). To the traditional story that Aristotle drowned himself in the waters of Euripus because he was not able to figure out its nature, Addison sarcastically adds that based on this reasoning, it would be hard to decide in which element Aristotle should have perished. Addison then goes on to ridicule Aristotle's followers, finally painting an absurd scene, in which two Aristotelians go at each other like boxers, armed with propositions and syllogisms, throwing barbarisms at each other but entangling themselves hopelessly in their follies. The oration ends in a passionate plea to the audience to be done with the old philosophy and chain the Aristotelian commentators (that is, their books) in the libraries, free from the sight of any reader, to be eaten by worms and moths.On other occasions, Addison showcased his enthusiasm for the new science in Latin poetry (cf.Ad Burnettum sacrae theoriae telluris auctoremandBarometri descriptioin this database), but here, he did so in a witty and elegant prose oration adorned with rhetorical figures. Addison's short oration on the new philosophy was reprinted in other books and continued to be read well into the 18th century, either in Latin and English (The Altar of Love, London 1727) or in English only (appended to the popular English translation of Fontenelle'sA Week's Conversation on the Plurality of Worlds,2nd editionLondon 1728,4th editionLondon 1757).","Haan 2005, 7–8 and 32–34","Addison, Joseph‎(← links)","Addison, Joseph:Nova philosophia veteri praeferenda est, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Nova_philosophia_veteri_praeferenda_est(last revision: 31.08.2021).",Scans of 1693 edition (all three orations) in sharefolder.,"MK, JL, IT",Yes,IT,

It is dedicated to the question if the measurements on wine caskets, a merchant undertook with his gauging rod in order to determine the volume, can be correct. Or, more generally speaking, which measurements are necessary for the determination of the volume of a casket.After a dedication to his patrons Maximilian, prince of Liechtenstein and Helmhard Jörger of Tollet and a short preambel, the first part lists some known facts on circles, cylinders, cones and spheres. This is followed by aSupplementum ad Archimedemwhich is a systematic investigation of solids generated by revolving conic sections. In this part he uses his new heuristic infinitesimal methods for the volumes of these rotating bodies. For instance, he deduces the volume of a torus by infinitely many obliquely cut infinitely flat cylinders.Part two is dedicated to the original question of the volume of wine caskets which are consideres special cases of revolving conic sections. Several shapes of wine caskets are investigated, and finally Kepler finds two remarkable properties of the ""Austrian caskets"": 1) They have the greatest volume for a given rod measurement and 2), the volume remains almost unchanged for a small deviation of the dimensions. The second is a consequence of the first, namely that a function does not change much next to its extreme values, a fact,Fermatformulated explicitly in the 1620s (printed posthumously inMethodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam). These properties however justified the use of the gauging rod as a suitable tool for measuring the volumes of Austrian wine caskets. For caskets of other proportions or shapes, however, other results had to be expected.Part three finally deals with applications of previously obtained results, in particular, how to correctly gauge various types of caskets.After Kepler's observation, it reportedly took him three days to produce the core results of the work. However lacking a publishing opportunity, it was almost a year until it was printed in Linz by Hans Plank being the first work printed in Linz. It was not as successful as Kepler hoped for, so a German popularized version named ""Außzug auß der Uralten Messe Kunst Archimedis"" appeared in 1616 and became more popular due to being taylored for the use of wine merchants and coopers.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 7, 300Edwards 1979, 102-103Klug; Kepler 1908(German translation and commentary), esp. 99-110.",Exercitationes geometricae sex‎(← links),"Kepler, Johannes:Nova stereometria doliorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Nova_stereometria_doliorum(last revision: 16.05.2022).",,,Yes,FB,

The work's advertising character is reflected in its introductory paratexts. Besides a letter of dedication to the cardinal Camillo Pamfilio and an address to the reader, the latter comprise fourellogiaextolling Fontana's achievements, two testimonies by Neapolitan Jesuits to the excellence of his microscopes and telescopes, and a portrait whose inscription hails him asNOVI TUBI ASTRONOMICI INVENTOR.As indicated by a table of contents at the end, the work's about  150 quarto pages comprise eighttractatussubdivided intocapita,observationes, or a combination of both.Tractatus1 provides a history of the telescope, which supposedly was already known to the ancients but has been dramatically improved by Fontana.Tractatus2 summarizes what Fontana (thinks to have) found out about the moon.Tractatus3–8 present observations and images of celestial and terrestrial bodies: the waxing and waning moon, Mercury and Venus, Mars and Jupiter, Saturnus and the Pleiades, and finally minute objects such as cheese mites, ants, or human hair, which have been studied through a microscope of Fontana's own construction. (For a similar collection of microscopical observations, see the appendix to Pierre Borel'sDe vero telescopii inventore). Except for the lasttractatus,  the observations are illustrated by more or less refined woodcuts.The work features a number of different styles and modes of presentation. The first twotractatusare partly written in the style of scholasticquaestiones. For instance, the answer to the question posed in the title of ch. 1.6 (p. 18) starts with the scholastic formulaRespondetur affirmative, ""It is answered in the affirmative"". The observations of the moon are formulated in a telegraphic style. Indeed, they are just keys to the corresponding illustrations on facing pages. Some technical terms used by Fontana, such asfons(""fountain""),margarita(""pearl""), orgemma(""gem"") for more and less conspicuous areas of greater luminosity, are explained in the first and only chapter oftractatus3 (pp. 29–31). The observations of the planets, by contrast, are described in full sentences. These observations (most of which are not or only roughly dated, something noted, but not explained in the address to the reader, pp. 8–9 ) are often reported in the passive voice and without any personal intervention of the observer, producing an air of objectivity. The first observation of Mars, for instance (p. 105), is recounted as follows:Martis figura perfecte sphaerica distincte atque clare conspiciebatur. Item in medio atrum habebat conum instar nigerrimae pilulae. Martis circulus discolor, sed in concava parte ignitus deprehendebatur. Sole excepto reliquis aliis planetis semper Mars candidior demonstratur.The shape of Mars was distinctly and clearly seen to be perfectly spherical. Moreover, it had a black mark in the middle which looked like a pitch-black small ball. The circle of Mars featured different colours but was seen to be fiery in its concave part (?). Except for the Sun, Mars always presents itself as more shiny than the other planets.In contrast to the calm and impersonal tone of the celestial observations, the marvelous, paradoxical, and exciting character of the things to be seen under the microscope is repeatedly stressed. The description of an ant, for instance, begins (p. 149):Formica cancri magnitudinem sortita non minorem admirationem praebet quam pulex.(""An ant grows to the size of a crab and causes no less admiration than the flea [previously described]"").",,,"Fontana, Francesco:Novae coelestium terrestriumque rerum observationes, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Novae_coelestium_terrestriumque_rerum_observationes(last revision: 07.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It sets a new paradigm of empiricism which became a scientific standard, especially in England's Royal Society.Initially only intended as the second chapter of Bacon's project of theInstauratio magna, it became the part of the work to be at least provisionally completed. Its title was used,pars pro toto, for the book as a whole, as is evident in many the later editions. For clarity and completeness, the structure of theInstauratio magnashall briefly be presented in its entirety.The engraved title page bears a picture of a sailing ship and the motto, taken from the biblical book of Daniel,Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia. The dedication to King James I of England is followed by a preface and a table of contents (distributio operis) together with a brief introduction to the planned six parts of the work, part I being on the various scientific disciplines, part II theNovum organum. Then, a page indicates that the first part is omitted in this version (deest pars prima instaurationis) which allows for a direct entrance to the best-known part, theNovum organum sive indicia vera de interpretatione naturae.This part is endowed with another preface before the main corpus is presented in aphorisms, again divided in two books. These aphorisms of various lengths are enumerated and present the core of Bacon's promotion of empiricism and criticism of Aristotelian logic and deductive reasoning.This involves a theory on observations that should not be obstructed by various sources of errors and prejudices of the (human) observer. These sources are called ""idols"" (idola), and Bacon lists four of them: ""Idols of the tribe"" (idola tribus) consist of all possible obstructions which can occur due to our human nature. We percive nature by our human senses and view phenomena by our human eyes. This is already a filter through which the pure natural phenomena have to pass. In the second source of errors, the ""idols of the cave"" (idola specus), Bacon addresses the individuals and their personal experiences and knowledge playing a role in observations. The third, the ""idols of the marketplace"" (idola fori), are communication problems and misunderstandings between individuals due to blurred notions and unclear language. Finally, ""idols of the theatre"" (idola theatri) consist of philosophical and scientific traditions which, according to Bacon, prevent a scientist from neutral interpretations of phenomena. In order to collect valid data, one has to dispose of these idols as far as possible so that the mind becomes atabula rasa, where nature could write on. Furthermore, the data has to be arranged systematically inhistoriaeon various things.A list of such 130historiae,  entitledParasceue ad historiam naturalem et experimentalemand accompanied by some more aphorisms, concludes theInstauratio magna.TheNovum organumdoes not only refer to Aristotle'sOrganumby its title, it is fierce criticism of Aristotelianism and deductive reasoning. According to Bacon, the Aristotelians are not capable of creating new knowledge. This can only be achieved by the inductive method which builds on new observations and experiments. Bacon had a vision of a different science, and especially in England, scientists were willing to follow this vision. The ""Philosophical Transactions"" of the Royal Society abound withHistoriaeandJohn Wallisfor instance even tries to fit mathematics in this paradigm (Arithmetica infinitorum). But also on the continent, the work's great success is visible by its many further editions (e.g. Leiden 1645 and 1650).","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008vol. 1, 372-375 / vol. 19, 137-142Alexander 2014, 265",,"Bacon, Francis:Novum Organum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Novum_Organum(last revision: 20.06.2022).",,MK,Yes,FB,

Encyclopedic in its aspirations, the book is basically structured like a lexicon, the headings being provided by the integers, beginning with one and ending with one billion and the multitude in general. For each number, aspects such as its occurrences in literature (including hidden occurrences in the guise of letters with certain numerical values), its arithmetic properties, and its meanings are discussed. Especially the analysis of the use of numbers in the Bible is accompanied by heavy allegorizing. One goal of the work consists in demonstrating the harmony between the Bible and ancient philosophy with regard to numbers.

Since this book was apparently not widely known, the author felt justified in repeating the description in ampler form.In the beginning, various possibilities to name the fungus are proposed. The names are of the pre-Linnean type wavering between a name in the common sense of the word and a description: they are made up of a substantive followed by a string of adjectives and other qualifications. Zwinger declares himself indifferent regarding the official designation. Next, the circumstances of discovery (September, in a wood close to the Rhine) are reported and the fungus itself is described.

Pediculus (A) crassitie tubuli straminei, aequalis, membranaceus totus, leviter cavus, abit in summitate in caliculum (B) sive capitulum forma sua dimidiatam sphaeram cavam ex membrana admodum subtili reticulata compositam referens, magnitudinis, sicut antea iam dictum, variae.The biggest specimens I saw were around the length of a span. All parts were of grey or blackish color. The stem (A) was as thick as a straw, smooth, entirely skinny, tubular (but with a narrow tube). On the top, it formed a small goblet (B) or head, whose shape was that of a hollow hemisphere consisting of a quite thin, paper-like, interveined substance. The goblet's size varied, as already said.The description is complemented by a copper engraving (to which the letters A and B refer) at the end of the first volume of theActa Helvetica. The reader is asked to compare the newly found fungus to others described in a number of standard works, especially to a particular fungus delineated in theNova plantarum genera(Florence 1729) of the Italian botanist Pier Antonio Micheli in order to verify that it is not identical with any of them. Zwinger concludes by stating that the new fungus could represent either a new genus or an unknown species of an already known genus.

However, a monthly issue usually also contains one or two original contributions like the presentPhysical Observation on the Weight of Rock Salt Inside and Outside the Minesby Johann Jacob von Döblen, a young doctor from Rostock who had just become a provincial physician of Swedish Scania.The aim of the short article is to refute or at least to question the apparently common belief that rock salt (sal gemmae) becomes heavier than it has been in its original deposit when brought to the surface of the earth. Döblen presents the reader with a lively first-person narrative, which starts from a few trinkets made of rock salt in his possession. When one of them, a water clock he used for pious meditations, cracked, while a book remained intact, he took this as a hint to embark on some learned reflections about salt and chose the aforementioned idea as his subject. He already had conducted some pertinent experiments at Kraków at an earlier time, four of which he enumerates: they all amount to weighing pieces of rock salt (and other minerals) underground and aboveground without finding any difference. Moreover, as Döblen was told by a salt administrator, the miners, who were allowed to take salt away for themselves for free,  used to joke that what they could easily carry down in the mines was too heavy for them overground.Döblen garnishes his article with several quotations from contemporary learned literature, whose authors defend the erroneous belief and try to explain the mock phenomenon. One pertinent passage is quoted verbatim in German. The report concludes with an extract from an equally German letter by a friend whom Döblen had informed about his experiments. Döblen himself writes fluent Latin and uses few technical terms.

AfterEdmond Halleyhad proposed that a transit of Venus would provide a precious opportunity to measure the parallax of the sun, which would in turn allow calculating its distance from the earth, the two transits of Venus that would take place in 1761 and 1769 were eagerly awaited by the astronomical community. Already in 1761 and again, on a larger scale, in 1769, astronomers traveled to distant parts of the earth to obtain the best possible parallax values.Maximilian Hell, who had published yearlyEphemeridessince 1757 in his capacity as head of the Viennese observatory, dedicated the 1761 issue almost entirely to observations regarding the transit of Venus. Although he did not manage to obtain any extra-European data (the transit was successfully observed at the Cape of Good Hope, for example), he could publish observations from a considerable number of places between Madrid and Saint Petersburg.After an unpaginatedLectori astronomo monitum(""Information to the astronomer who reads this""), theObservationes transitus Venerisfall into three parts, as already announced in the full title: reports of Hell's personal observations and other observations made in Vienna (pp. 1–32); a collection of other reports made across the whole of Europe (pp. 33–118); and reports of some other, unconnected observations, notably of eclipses of the moons of Jupiter (pp. 118–123). The book is concluded by indexes of the observations mentioned and of some mathematical problems connected to their evaluation and by a list of errata (pp. 123–124).As is often the case with scientific texts from the 18th century, when the mathematization of many disciplines and the concomitant formalization of their language was underway but not completed, the style of Hell's exposition shows considerable variation. On the one hand, one finds running text for the descriptive (e.g. regarding the setup of the observations) and interpretative parts. On the other hand, lists of observational data and computations are presented in a mixture of whole sentences, keywords, abbreviations, mathematical equations, and astronomical symbols. Even the running text, however, swarms with technical terminology, as in the following passage regarding the telescope used by Hell (p. 2):Tubum meum dioptricum 5 pedum etiam alio modo pro hac observatione adaptavi, scilicet aperturam, quam alias 11 linearum habebam, ad 9 lineas contraxi, qua limbos solis Venerisque praecisiores viderem, mutata etiam paulisper distantia vitri obiectivi a lente oculari, ob quam mutationem cum angulus visorius quoque immutatus sit, necesse habui (si filo cursorio uterer) determinare semiangulum micrometri …I also prepared my five feet telescope otherwise than usual for this observation: I reduced the aperture, which I had at 11 lines otherwise, to 9 lines, to get a more precise view of the edges of the sun and Venus; I also made a small change to the distance between the objective and the eyepiece, and since the visual angle was also affected by this change, I needed, if I was to use a moveable reticle, to determine the half-angle of the micrometre …The reader must indeed, as intimated by the title of the foreword, possess considerable astronomical and mathematical expertise to follow Hell's account.TheObservatio transitus Venerisdemonstrates not only its author's personal skill in astronomical observation. It also shows him to be in the centre of a pan-European network of astronomers who provided him with the data which are processed in the work. Highly conscious of the paramount importance of international cooperation, Hell untertook a major effort to assemble as much reliable information as possible.In 1770, Hell published anotherObservatio transitus Venerison the 1769 transit, which came out in Vienna and Copenhagen. Thanks to a now truly global cooperation, he and other astronomers were finally able to calculate a value for the distance between earth and sun that deviated no more than 1–2% from the actual value (149'600'000 km).",Pärr 2013Aspaas 2020,"Hell, Maximilian‎(← links)Methodus singularis qua solis parallaxis determinari poterit‎(← links)","Hell, Maximilian:Observatio transitus Veneris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Observatio_transitus_Veneris(last revision: 08.02.2023).",,"MK, JL",Yes,MK,

A letter to the reader, in which Falloppio reflects on the question of when one should publish one's findings, opens the book. The rest of the work contains Falloppio's anatomical observations. Despite the length of his text, which runs to over 300 pages, the author chose the form of a letter to his colleague Pietro Manna (Petrus Manna) whom he addresses directly from time to time asPetrusorMannaas well as by using personal and possessive pronouns. In the beginning, Falloppio expresses his admiration forVesaliusand hismonumentum divinum(fol. 6r), that is, his workDe humani corporis fabrica. He states that he has first hesitated to write a book on anatomy himself because of this important work, but after he has gained some confidence, not least by the contact to Vesalius himself who was his teacher, he has now taken on the task to write about his findings (fol. 6v). Falloppio wants to judge whether the Galenian or the Vesalian anatomy comes closer to the truth (fol. 6v).

The presentObservations on Two Fourth Powers Whose Sum Can be Subdivided into Two Other Fourth Powers(E428 in theEneström index of Euler's works) are typical not only of Euler's mathematical genius but also of his way of presenting his reasoning and results. Euler puts the question whether there exist pairs of fourth powers whose sums equal the sums of other pairs of fourth powers (A4+B4=C4+D4) and answers it in the affirmative, providing a constructive proof that can be used to produce infinitely many solutions. The proof proceeds through a series of ingenious substitutions which lead up to a point where a quadruple of fourth powers satisfying the above condition can be constructed on the basis of a single freely selectable variable. It is this kind of reasoning which makes the article worth publishing in Euler's eyes:spero methodum, qua sum usurus, non omni attentione fore indignum, as he remarks with modest pride. The result itself has perhaps already been found before, he says, but he does not care greatly and has no time to check the entire literature (pp. 64–65).The article runs to a bare six pages and is clearly structured: after an introductory overview of theorems and hypotheses concerned with sums of fourth powers, the problem is succinctly stated. The general solution through the aforementioned series of substitutions constitutes the longest part by far. At the end, two special solutions are calculated to exemplify the procedure. (Because the numbers involved are huge – the sums are of the magnitude 1025– the second solution is wrong due to a calculation error, as can be easily checked with a pocket calculator today.) In addition to the structure just sketched, the article is subdivided into six numbered sections.Euler presents his argument in fluent, elegant Latin. Equations and other formulaic expressions take up about half of the space. They are syntactically embedded in the natural language text, but mostly set apart typographically. The mathematical notation used by Euler is basically the modern one, the most noticeable difference being the habit of writingxxforx2, although power notation (also for squares) is otherwise widely in use throughout the article.The Latin text is didactic in the sense that Euler does his best to make the reader understand not only the result and the single steps leading up to it but the rationale behind it as well. For instance, he comments on his first substitution, A=p+q, D=p–q, C=r+s, B=r–s, that the choice ofr=pands=qwould yield the trivial solution (p. 65):Verum inde nihil plane lucraremur, cum oriatur casus per se obvius C=A et B=D. Interim tamen hic ipse casus ad alias solutiones manuducere valet.But we would gain absolutely nothing by this [puttingr=p,s=q] because the result would be the trivial case C=A and B=D. At the same time, however, this very case can lead us to other solutions.So Euler hastens to assure the reader that this substitution nonetheless constitutes a necessary first step on which he will now build further. Later (p. 66), he repeats this procedure by choosing another variablek=abobtaining the same trivial solution. By this he motivates his later choice ofk=ab(1+z), a way to deviate by the variablezfrom the known case.This passage also provides an impression of the eighteenth-century technical terminology used by Euler. Some of the respective terms still live on in the modern vernaculars:casusbecomes ""case"",solutio, ""solution"" in English. Others have been replaced –per se obvius(literally ""clear from itself"") by ""trivial"", the title'sbiquadratum(""double square"") by ""fourth power"" – but they are nonetheless chosen so aptly that the modern reader has no great trouble to guess their meaning.",,"Euler, Leonhard‎(← links)","Euler, Leonhard:Observationes circa bina biquadrata, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Observationes_circa_bina_biquadrata(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

Most of van Leeuwenhoek's letters - also earlier ones - were sent to the Royal Society in Dutch and subsequently translated into English before publication in thePhilosophical Transactions. However, there have been some misunderstandings with the earlier Dutch letters so that the choice of Latin could have been a strategy to reduce the danger of being lost in translation (Henderson 2012b, 245 f.). Another, not mutually exclusive reason could have been the delicate topic of the letter that van Leeuwenhoek would have rather not published in a vernacular language (Lindeboom 1982, 202;Cobb 2006, 203). The present letter contains the first description of the human semen, which van Leeuwenhoek had discovered with the help of a microscope. He tells his readers that he first examined the semen of a man suffering from gonorrhea which has been brought to him by his friend Ham.

Usually, the observations published were the author's own, but this was not mandatory, as evinced by the presentMedical Observations Concerning the Human Head, which the doctor Johann Georg Schenck published at the age of 24: they have been collected from some 150 ancient, medieval (Latin and Arabic), and early modern authors. In view of his youth and the fact that this was his first book, the author apparently found second-hand observations a legitimate surrogate for personal ones.The work features a notable paratextual apparatus. A dedication to two local nobles is followed by a 40 pages preface to the reader, five pages of Greek and Latin poems by friends of Schenck, a catalogue of some 150 ancient, medieval, and early modern source authors, as well as another, short, preface announcing comparable works for the rest of the human body (below). At the end, one finds a full table of contents and a list of errata. The most important paratext is the long preface. In it, Schenck inter alia claims to follow the example of the HippocraticEpidemics(fol. ):(2v), showing no awareness of the difference between first-hand and second-hand case reports, and in considerable detail explains the medical usefulness of the practical knowledge gathered his book  (11th, unpaginated page – fol. **3v). Moreover, he asserts that he has left the style of his excerpts unchanged, even in the case of medievallatinobarbari(fol. **3v; in fact, however, he occasionally deviates from the original wording) and mentions in passing that he has also translated some of his sources from German (fol. [**4r]; the initial catalogue names several partly vernacular authors like Hieronymus Bock,Sebastian Münzer, andJacob Ruf).In the main text, 418observationes, filling a few lines to a few pages, are presented on some 500 octavo pages. Eachobservatiofeatures a thematic title, which usually indicates its topic in some detail, such asCapitis dolor secundum Indorum medicorum sententiam ex vermibus in cerebro natis excitari solitus(""According to the opinion of Indian doctors, headache uses to be caused by worms born in the brain"").

I–IX are all about hair, CCL–CCCII have to do with the eyes, and so on), but which rationale dictates the sequence of these groups remains obscure.It seems to have taken some time, but eventually, the formula found by Schenck proved successful, and he was able to fulfill the promise made in his second preface. He published six more volumes of the same make, dedicated to the heart and lung (1594), the other inner organs (1595–1596, in two parts), the reproductive organs (1596), outwardly recognizable diseases (1596), plagues (1597), and poisons (1597). The whole series was republished in 1599.

Instead of a science of things below the lunar sphere, the expression more specifically denotes a science dedicated to atmospheric phenomena.The observations are mostly presented in the form of simple tables or in telegraphic style. The weather in May, for instance, is recorded as follows (p. 42):Aer plerumque serenus. Venti frequentiores S, N & NO. d. 1 nivosus N 3. d. 6 SSW 3. d. 24 NO 3. d. 25 N 3.(""Mostly fair. Quite frequent winds from S, N and NE. 1st snowy from N, [wind speed] 3; 6th SSW, 3; 24th NE, 3; 25th N, 3."") Whole sentences are used in the description of a few simple experiments in the temperature section (for example, boiling water was found to develop an ice rind in 1 min. 31 sec. in the intense cold of January 25th, p. 40) and partly also in the descriptions of the polar lights. The latter occasionally become quite colourful as Celsius attempts to do justice to the exotic spectacle in words (p. 44–45):d. 29 h. 8.52' p.m. lumen ab oriente per verticem usque ad occidentem extensum per humeros Orionis, Saturnum et caudam Ursae Maioris. Primo quidem satis tranquillum exiguis curvaturis gaudebat; deinde vero maiori vehementia radios versus zenith eiaculabat, ita ut h. 9 egregium in coelo praebens spectaculum variis figuris et coloribus, imprimis violaceo et viridi, luderet.On [February] 29th at 8:52 p.m., a light appeared which stretched from the east over the zenith to the west, passing through the shoulders of Orion, Saturn and the tail of the Greater Bear. At the beginning, it was rather quiet and showed only minor undulations. Later on, however, it shot up its rays to the zenith with greater power, so that it presented an exquisite spectacle in the sky, shimmering in different forms and colours, notably in purple and green.A small riddle is presented by the temperature measurements. Celsius used athermometrum Hauksbeianum(p. 39), but it is unclear to which of the two English instrument makers named Francis Hauksbee, the uncle (1660–1713) or the nephew (1687–1763), the epitheton refers. More importantly, the temperatures are given neither in Celsius' own scale, first published in 1742, nor in any of the other more common scales that were in use back then. Instead, a scale is used according to which the highest temperature of 1740 is given as 18.2° and the lowest as 126.0°.",,"Celsius, Anders‎(← links)","Celsius, Anders:Observationes meteorologicae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Observationes_meteorologicae(last revision: 07.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Although published over the course of several years, later papers build upon previous ones in the series. The first three papers provide summaries of meteorological and geophysical observations recorded in Uppsala and Lund; the fourth entails theoretical reflection on an aurora borealis observed near Uppsala in September 1717. The papers were part of the first volume of proceeding (Acta) of theSocietas Literaria Sveciae(“Learned Society of Sweden”). The secretary of the society, the Uppsala professor Erik Johan Burman was the editor of theActa. In this capacity, he became a pioneer in organizing meteorological observations in Sweden; his counterpart in Lund, Conrad Quensel quickly followed suit. Both Burman and Quensel studied the aurora borealis, which was seen as a meteorological phenomenon (Meteoron), quite extensively. Their papers on the phenomenon were the first to be published in a purely academic periodical in Sweden. TheActa Literaria Sveciaewere established in emulation of other reputable journals such as theActa Eruditorumof Leipzig and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. The intended readership of the SwedishActawas twofold. First, the Society wished to act as a driver for technological and intellectual progress within Sweden. Second, the founding fathers wished to use the international distribution of their periodical as a means to establish closer contact with the widerres publica litteraria. The papers on weather reports (in which observations of the aurora were included) were explicitly made with inspiration from British natural philosophers. Note that all observation dates in theActaare according to the Julian Calendar, which was used in Sweden at the time. In his theoretical reflection (Observatio circa Lumen Boreale), Burman presents a tentative theory of two types of aurora borealis; the lively, vivid, multi-coloured Chasma caused by effluvia and exhalations of sulphureous particles on the one hand, as opposed to the less spectacular, arc-like Lumen septentrionale caused by refraction or reflection of sunlight in the far north on the other.",Ellegren 2019Aspaas 2022,"Burman, Erik Johan‎(← links)Quensel, Conrad‎(← links)","Burman, Erik Johan; Quensel, Conrad:Observationes meteorologicae Upsalenses, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Observationes_meteorologicae_Upsalenses(last revision: 16.03.2023).",contributed by Per Pippin Aspaas,,Yes,,

For professors at universities, dissertations were a convenient publication form to distribute their research, since a dissertation could be printed for every one of their graduating students and said student, who is named as the respondent or defendent on the title page, usually had to bear the printing costs. Mauchart's more than 50 dissertations stem from the most part from this opportunity-oriented academic publication practice. A number of these pieces are dedicated to his special field of interest: the eye.The present example is a short Neo-Latin dissertation on ocular prostheses in 24 pages, or 18 numbered paragraphs. The respondent was Philipp Adam Haug, who earned his doctoral degree in March 1749. The titleOculus artificialis ΕΚΒΛΕΦΑΡΟΣ ΚΑΙ ΥΠΟΒΛΕΦΑΡΟΣis slightly misleading, as it suggests that the dissertation gives equal importance to the artificial eye put over the eyelid (ἐκβλέφαρος: outside the eyelid; ""Vorlegeauge"") and the artifical eye inserted into the eyesocket (ὑποβλέφαρος: beneath the eyelid; ""Einlegeauge""). In fact, Mauchart deals with the former only in passing (see esp.§.17.) and focusses for the most part on the latter. The prooemium on the misery of blindness and the eyes as the primary source of beauty is adorned with many references to the ancient world. Turning to the artificial eye as a means to restore this beauty, Mauchart first provides a definition and discusses the terminology. He then describes the history of the inserted artifical eye in art and medicine, gives precise instructions for its material, size, form and weight as well as recommendations for the communication between the artisan and the patient, deals with the condition of the eye socket, the process of inserting and removing the artifical eye, the proper maintenance of the eye socket, discusses advantages and disadvantages of the inserted artificial eye and informs the readers about alternatives.In the dissertation, the author refers to himself both aspraesesin the 3rd person singular (e.g.when talking about his own medical practice,applicuit talem [sc. oculum artificialem] subinde praeses aegris monoculis,§.8.) and in the 1st person plural (e.g. when referring toanotherof his recent dissertations on the eye,in nupera disputatione de staphylomate monuimus,§.3., or when uttering a judgement,nos haec vel supervacanea et molesta iudicamus,§.13.). The footnotes, which indicate sources, disappear completely after the first seven paragraphs. For most of what follows, Mauchart draws on his contemporaryJohn Thomas Woolhouseand his own experience. In one instance, Mauchart relates a humorous anecdote from his medical practice to emphasize that an artificial eye can look deceptively real (§.8.):Mirifica haec similitudo effecit, ut rustica quaedam, cum ipsi praeses oculum applicaret artificialem eiusque exquisitam cum naturali similitudinem attoniti mirarentur et depraedicarent adstantes spectatores, coeperit sanum claudere oculum, novo autem et artificiali suo circumspicere et aciem visus, quem scilicet pariter recuperandum somniabat, explorare, tandemque suspirans exclamare: ""Ego vero nihil video!"" Lepidum sane caput!""One result of this miraculous similarity was that when thepraesesgave a farmer's wife an artificial eye and the bystanding spectators admired and praised its extraordinary similarity to the natural eye with astonishment, she began to close the healthy eye, look around with her new artificial eye, explore her eyesight (which she thought foolishly to regain as well) – and finally to exclaim with a sigh: 'But I don't see anything!'  A witty head indeed!""The Latin is easy to read throughout. Mauchart's dissertation is quoted in chirurgical literature well into the 19th century (cf. Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach,Anleitung zum chirurgischen Verbande, Wien 1830,p. 99).",,"Mauchart, Burchard David‎(← links)","Mauchart, Burchard David; Haug, Philipp Adam:Oculus artificialis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oculus_artificialis(last revision: 09.08.2021).","on blindness & beauty in the eyesdecoration of eyes in women & menmedical cosmetical surgery: foeditas & visusoculus artificialis - footnote x) the terms ekblepharos/hypoblepharos from the ancient Greeks according to Woolhouse, but Mauchart says he could not find them anywhere (as well as the whole topic)history of oculus artificialis, esp. in statues""Forschungsgeschichte""observations and reflections of Woolhouse and Mauchart: most of all foeditas, but also cold, tearsmaterial and sizemeasures for size, form, weight of the hypoblepharosother necessary feature of the hypoblepharos, pupilcommunication between artisan and patientconditions for inserting the artifical eyeinserting and removing the artifical eyemaintenance of the eye socketadvantages and disadvantages of the artificial eyeM.'s observations and positionekblepharosalternatives to hypoblepharos, closing",,Yes,IT,

The lexicon belongs to the subgenre of lexica dedicated to the language of one particular, very important author (cf. theOeconomia Hippocratis). In this case, the author is Paracelsus, whose idiosyncratic, fanciful terminology rendered his perusal difficult, which gave rise half a dozen pertinent lexica in the second half of the 16th century (Klein 1999, 1918). Another Paracelsian dictionary is Gerhard Dorn'sDictionarium Theophrasti Paracelsi.The present work explains c. 800–1000 terms from Paracelsus' writings.

"Lucini, Paolo",Opticae iuxta Newtonianas leges a Paullo Lucinio Mediolanensi Latinis versibus expositae libri quatuor,,1793,Parma,Bodoni,18th century,Didactic poem,Physics,Optica(Google Books),906212,"By the mid-eighteenth century, Newtonian didactic poems in Latin flourished in Rome. Spearheaded by Carlo Noceti'sIris(2nd edition 1747), the primarily Jesuit vogue produced Roger Boscovich'sDe solis ac lunae defectibus(1760) and Benedikt Stay's formidablePhilosophia recentiorin ten books (1755-1792). Paolo Lucini'sOpticaseems to have originated in the same climate.The Milanese poet Lucini is an obscure figure. The preface tells us that he taught rhetorics in the seminar and college of Montefiascone, spent some time in Warsaw in the entourage of Giovanni Andrea Archetti, the papal nuncio in Poland, and died in Rome in 1790. TheOpticawas edited posthumously by Lucini's former student Paride Giustiniani in 1793. However, it appears to have been complete by the time of Lucini's trip to Poland (after 1775), where he decided to add panegyric verses on the Polish king Stanisław II August to each of the poem's books. Indeed, the closing verses of the poem suggest that Lucini had composed the poem when he was a young teacher of rhetorics in Rome, or probably rather in the nearby Montefiascone (p. 119):Haec super aetheria Titanis luce canebam,dum vetus eloquium sanctique Heliconis amore<m>instillabam animis, cinctusque impube coronahortabar teneros studia ad meliora Quirites.""I sang these verses on the etherial light of the sun, while I instilled the ancient eloquence and the love of sacred Helicon into the hearts (of the pupils) and, crowned with a youthful wreath, motivated the young Romans to pursue better studies.""Lucini programmatically follows Newton, as he announces in the proem:Newtoni inventa secutus / Angligenae magni(""following the discoveries of the great Englishman Newton"", p. 1). The poem, which comprises more than 3000 verses, is divided into four books: the first book deals with the nature of light, the second with the paths of light, the third with colours, and the fourth with the structure of the eye and optical instruments. Newton is the hero of the poem, but other scientists also step into the limelight, e.g. James Bradley, Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei. The poet embraces the movement of the earth, as proven by stellar aberration, and refutes outdated theories like the vortex theory, stating that he would rather have the stars carried on the backs of elephants (malim ego vectandas elephantum imponere dorso / astrorum moles, p. 21). Thus, the didactic poem presents not only Newtonian optics, but a panorama of the late eighteenth-century state of science in general.The four-book structure, the presence of a myth in the last book, and the wording of both the proem and the sphragis place Lucini'sOpticain the tradition of Vergil'sGeorgics. Into this Vergilian mould, the poet pours Newtonian science, ""arrang[ing] the not very consecutive or readable 'Opticks' into a flowing line of discussion"" (Naidan 1952, 119). While the didactic poem is probably connected somehow to those written by the Roman Jesuits, the biggest difference is the absence of a commentary that delves deeper into the science expounded in verse.The poem seems to have sunk into oblivion soon after its publication.",Naidan 1952,"Lucini, Paolo‎(← links)","Lucini, Paolo:Optica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Optica(last revision: 01.02.2022).",p. 4-5: Bradley - moving earth  - aberration - heliocentric model (dum terrigenae Vestae cum matre feruntur / aethera per liquidum ...),,Yes,IT,

The work refounded the discipline named in its title by not dealing primarily with the traditional topics of reflection and refraction, but rather scrutinizing the very nature of light and colour. Since it does not presuppose much higher mathematics, it is more accessible than its predecessor. Observations and in particular experiments play a crucial role in the exposition. This is already evident from the structure of the account, which is subdivided into different kinds of sections: definitions of terms and axioms (at the beginning), problems, observations and experiments (by which problems are solved) and propositions and theorems (general statements based on the former). The most obvious difference between thePrincipiaand theOpticks, however, is their respective language. For reasons not specified, Newton composed the latter in English instead of Latin, which necessitated a translation for his continental readers.This translation Newton entrusted to his disciple Samuel Clarke, but he seems to have supervised him or checked the result of his efforts: in the openingPraefatio interpretis, Clarke explains that even minor changes have been introduced only according to the master's wish or with his permission. In the followingAuctoris monitio ad lectorem, Newton details the purpose and content of his book, vindicates his reluctant publication almost 30 years after writing most of it down, and repudiates any translation made without his knowledge (nolim ea me insciente in alium sermonem converti) – another indication how serious he took this issue. TheErrata, corrigenda et addendaare not restricted to the correction of typos, but also present a number of afterthoughts, which for some reason were not directly incorporated into the text. Newton also indicates that he has enlarged the third book. Appended to theOptice, one finds two shorter, separately paginated treatises concerned with topics from analytic geometry and calculus (De quadratura curvarum) originally composed in Latin, as announced in the full title. The tables of illustrations are gathered at the very end of the volume.TheOpticeitself, like thePrincipia, falls into three books. Books 1 (pp. 1–206) and 2 (pp. 207–271), each of which consists of two parts, present Newton's findings concerning the nature and behaviour of light. Right at the beginning, Newton lays open his method: He would not infer any properties of light from hypotheses but only from reasoning and experiment; to that end he would start with definitions and axioms on (rays of) light. After these preliminaries, the results of experiments with refraction and reflection using prisms are presented. He introduces his invention of a reflecting telescope in order to avoid refraction effects of lenses and investigates the relationship of different colors and their refraction properties. The discovery of ""Newton's rings"", an interference effect of two prisms pressed together, is at the core of the second book. When Thomas Young developed his wave theory for light some 100 years later, he used Newton's extraordinarily accurate measurements for his calculations of wavelengths of visible colors not far from modern values.The character of book 3 (pp. 272–348) is different. It starts from a series of optical observations, but then Newton brusquely declares that he was interrupted by other business while making them and now does not feel like resuming them. Instead, he concludes with 23 open questions (16 in the English original) mostly, but not exclusively concerned with optics, which he leaves to future researchers to answer. In the 18th century these queries were considered one of the most interesting and fruitful features of theOpticks, where especially the later ones added to the Latin (and another English) edition experienced the highest attention. Inquery 21, p. 315Newton is wondering if rays of light are small bodies (corpuscula) emitted by shining objects. This particle theory of light is later called ""corpuscular theory"".Clarke's translation sometimes adapts Newton's syntax to the conventions of classical Latin, but faithfully renders the content of each single sentence. He also takes care to exactly reproduce the overall train of thought of the original by paying close attention to the connectors. If his vocabulary sometimes sounds scholastic, this is usually caused by Newton's Latin-based neologisms, which are are simply given a Latin ending as well by Clarke.Reflexibilitas, for instance, is the fully latinised form of Newton's ""reflexibility"". The translation usually is a bit longer than the English text, because Newton's style is terse and Clarke tries to avoid any possible obscurity, but the difference is not great. In a handful of places, however, clarifying explanations are added which go beyond the remarks in theErrata, corrigenda et addenda. The most salient case is provided by the work's very first sentences. Newton's opening leaves much to be inferred:My Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by Hypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments: In order to which, I shall premise the following Definitions and Axioms.Obviously author and translator agreed that the reader could use a little more guidance. Highlighting substantial additions in capitals, the translation reads as follows:In hoc libro conscribendo non mihi id institutum fuit, ut POSITIS CERTIS hypothesibus NOTAS luminis proprietates EXINDE explicarem, sed ut ABDITAS NEC ANTEA OBSERVATAS eius proprietates SIMPLICITER proponerem et propositas ratione DUMTAXAT experimentisque comprobarem, DEINDE, QUID EX EISDEM CONSEQUATUR, OSTENDEREM. Quem in finem definitiones et axiomata subiecta praemittere statui.The contrast between conventional and Newtonian optics has become very pronounced, and Newton's claim to novelty is now stated in strong words.TheOpticewas as successful as was to be expected. The translation was republished in 1711, 1719, 1740, 1749, and1773(in which last edition the publication history is summarized on pp. x–xi). Most continental 18th century readers learned about Newton's optical findings from Clarke's version.","Anthony 1960, 78–93.Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 10, 56–60.","Newton, Isaac‎(← links)Review of: Newton, Tractatus duo‎(← links)Clarke, Samuel‎(← links)De vita Isaaci Newtoni commentariolus‎(← links)Newton's epitaph‎(← links)Dissertatio physica de iride‎(← links)De coloribus iuventus delecta disseret‎(← links)De quadratura curvarum‎(← links)Anti-Newtonianismus‎(← links)","Newton, Isaac; Clarke, Samuel:Optice, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Optice(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,"MK, FB",

The single books deal with:Hygiene and dieteticsKinds of feverDifferent diseases ordereda capite ad calcemDiseases of the skin and the internal organsToxicologySurgery and GynaecologyPharmacologyAs Johann Winter of Andernach explains in the letter to the reader and in the dedicatory letter to Jean du Bellay, he regarded this work as extremely helpful especially for students as it contained almost all knowledge needed in medicine. He therefore decided to translate it into Latin. His translation is based on the 1528 Aldine, but as the text of it was insufficient or simply wrong in many places, he had to consult other manuscripts, not only of Paul, but also of his sources, including a very old manuscript of Oribasius. Moreover, he complains that while he was well underway in translating the work, he heard rumours of another Latin translation being printed in Basel. He probably refers to the 1532translationby Alban Thorer, which lacks, as Winter correctly states, the sixth book on surgery. Winter describes the translation of this book – also in the letter to du Bellay – as the most important, yet also as the most difficult, as there are hardly any Latin descriptions of surgery and thus a proper technical language is lacking (see alsoNutton 1985, 78). Nonetheless, as Winter became aware of the other translation being already in print, he had to speed up and could not polish his translation as thoroughly as planned.
Still, in the letter to du Bellay, Winter states that he did his best to render the Greek text into good Latin, as so many translations by his contemporaries are of very poor quality, especially with respect to vocabulary that he vividly describes as being taken from the dregs of vulgar speech (vocabulis sordidis et ex intima plebei sermonis faece acceptis).
After the two letters, there is an exhaustive alphabetical index. The work includes a short commentary in an unusual format, as each book is preceded byannotationes, in which Winter discusses some variant readings, translations of Greek words, sources, etc., and also listserrata. Furthermore, there are at times notes in the margins, in which Winter discusses variants, states where he could not read his manuscripts, mentions different readings Paul's sources, etc. This light annotation was developed into a full-blown commentary by Winter in a later edition (Strasbourg 1542; seeKristeller et al. 1960ff., vol. IV, 176–177).

But Rheticus died only after several months leaving Otho with lots of unpublished manuscripts and the beginning of a more precise version of trigonometric tables, already a labour of at least twelve years by then.But the promises Otho made concerning the publication of Rheticus's manuscripts proved to become a difficult task. After several attempts, Otho finally found Frederick IV, Elector Palatine of the Rhine, to support his project and with the help of four student computers he was able to publish it in 1596.The enormous compendium contains several works by Rheticus and Otho. But as there exists only one paratextual section in the beginning the compendium shall be treated as a whole.The frontispiece shows the coat-of-arms of Frederick IV held by a heavenly hand and two obelisks framing the title. Sun, moon and the stars send their rays to the tips of the obelisks. At their base, several geometrical and astronomical instruments for measuring angles are depicted.

The publisher, Franciscus de Franciscis in Venice, informs us in a dedication to Francesco Maria II di Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, that he had prepared this volume for printing for several months, not without difficulties, to present it now to the world. It seems to have been a coincidence rather than intention by de Franciscis that Maurolico had passed away only days before the publication of his works (Rosen 1957, p. 114).After the title page, a table of contents informs us about the collection:De Sphaera liber unuscontains theoretical and spherical astronomy and a refutation ofCopernicus’sheliocentrism in 45 chapters, indicating i.a. that the astronomer should be flogged for his thoughts.The shortComputus Ecclesiasticus in summan collectusis an astronomical work on the calendar, starting with general explanations, e.g. about different ways to measure a year (anno Arabico, Aegyptico, Romano), going on about equinox, solstice and the four seasons and ending with the calculations for movable feasts such as Pentecost or Easter.TheTractatus instrumentorum astronomicorumexplains the construction and use of what according to the author are the most important tools of the astronomer in unnumbered chapters and with the help of illustrations: thequadratum geometricum, the quadrant, the astrolabe, the armillary sphere and the solid sphere.TheDe lineis horariis brevis tractatusis an abridged version of the longer work on gnomonics in three books at the end of the collection, this one covering only ten short chapters on twenty pages.The next three works present Maurolico’s interpretation and extension of the thirteenth of Euclid’sElements, on regular solid figures, which are here called book 13, 14 and 15 of Euclid’s Elements “in the tradition of Maurolico”. The author presents this in Euclidian tradition withpropositionesand adds a series of tables on the construction of regular figures inscribed in a circle or sphere.TheMusicae traditionesrepresent a work which would not be considered mathematical in modern terms, but was part of mathematics in medieval and early modern times: on music, the nature of sounds, on musical notes and intervals, on the lyra, on inventors of musical instruments, all in the tradition of Boethius musical theory. Boethius had already explained that music and arithmetic were connected, a point which Maurolico presents in this work as well.The last work in the collection are theDe lineis horariis libri tres, on gnomonics, the third book also treats conics.Appended to the collection are Maurolico’sArithmeticorum libri II.Right after the the table of contents in a copious index (index copiosissimus) of more than 20 pages a huge amount of keywords is listed alphabetically with page references. The parts of the collection come with a paratext section of various sizes which contains at least a preface to the reader by Maurolico. In the case of Euclid'sElements, the preliminaries consist of a preface, a dedication to Hieronimus Barresius and a poem to the latter.This collection of several previously unpublished works by Maurolico proved very successful: it was reprinted several times in full, including overseas, some of the works were published separately afterwards, (Rosen 1957b) and it was integrated into und cited in textbooks. The most famous passage would presumably be a sentence in theDe Sphaera, indicating that Nicolaus Copernicus deserved flogging for his new ideas about the moving Earth (Rosen 1957b).","Rosen 1957,Rosen 1957b,Progetto Maurolico",,"Maurolico, Francesco:Opuscula mathematica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Opuscula_mathematica(last revision: 06.02.2022).",,,Yes,JL,

Written in the form of a set of university lectures abounding in references to classical authors, the treatise's composition allows Beroaldo to gradually pass from earthquakes to pestilence, which, in his opinion, may emerge after or coincide with other disruptive natural cataclysms, to Galen whose medical writings are supposed to mark the highest peak of medical discourse and provide the most reliable response to the natural events. Unlike some clear members of pro-Hellenic science group (likeLeoniceno, Niccolò), in the treatise Beroaldo combines his interest in Greek scientific and medical sources with Latin authors avoiding at the same time the Islamic tradition. TheOpusculumis especially significant due to one of the first references to Lucretius's account on the origin of earthquakes. However, despite quoting from theDe rerum natura, Beroaldo mainly remains within the traditional natural philosophical framework, but adding one significant detail - he claims that there might be a correlation between the geographical area in which the earthquakes occur, and their disruptiveness. He goes on to say that since the earthquakes are provoked by the level of heat beneath the surface of the earth, in hotter regions the chance of having an earthquake increases. The application of Hippocrates' theory of climate remains relevant in the case of plague. Theannotationessection presents a series of text critical and exegetic remarks on various Galenic passages.

During the late Middle Ages, a number of commentaries were already written (Thorndike 1949). From the end of the 15th to the 17th century, hundreds of editions appeared. In most of these, the text was adapted, translated, supplemented or, again, equipped with a commentary, as demonstrated in the projectTHE SPHEREconducted at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science by Matteo Valleriani.The commentary by the Bohemian astronomer, physician and theologist Wenceslaus Fabri, titledThe Small Work on the Sphere with Commentary and Diagrams, was one of the earliest to appear in print, and a quite successful one at that. Half a dozen editions appeared between 1495 and 1520. No place, date and printer are given for the present one, but it has a good chance to be the first one (for whose place and year, seeThorndike 1949, 41 n. 84), as Fabri is calledmedicine baccalariusin the colophon, while he is alreadymedicine doctorin the colophon of the edition Cologne 1501. Also the spellingssperaandspericum, for which later editions have the more correctsphera/-icum, point towards an early date.The work opens with an introduction, in which astronomy is defined, subdivided and distinguished from astrology (which is less of a science, because it does not provide certain knowledge). Moreover, the four Aristotelian causes ofDe sphaera mundiare enumerated. What Fabri has to say about the efficient causes (he subdivides the efficient cause) amounts to an advertisement of the treatise based on its known virtues: one of these causes is the author Sacrobosco (who is calledde Sacro Bustoby Fabri) himself,qui ex diversis libris astronomiae prolixis et difficilibus hunc tractatum breviter collegit, qui ad astronomiam breviter et faciliter introducit(""who from various long and difficult books on astronomy put together this treatise, which provides a short and easy introduction to astronomy"", fol. A iii v).Fabri provides both the text of theSphaera, including some 30 diagrams, and his commentary on it. Both are clearly distinguished from one another typographically, as they are double-spaced and single-spaced respectively. The commentary's parts, which are between a few lines and two pages in length, are inserted at irregular intervals after chunks of text running from one half to three pages. In terms of content, a good part of the commentary is paraphrastic: Sacrobosco's account is summarised, its structure analysed and sometimes justified. In additions to this paraphrastic skeleton, often announced byNota(""Note!""), technical terms are explained (see e.g. fol. [C v r] onpolus borealis, ""North pole""), questions arising from the text are discussed (is the equatorial zone inhabited?, fol. [A vii v–viii r]) or additional information given. In the last case, Fabri may stray far from the text, as in his very last comment, where the name of Dionysius Areopagita, mentioned by Sacrobosco in the context of the eclipse during the crucifixion, gives rise to a discussion of the topography of ancient Athens. Sometimes Fabri corrects Sacrobosco – a common strategy in commentaries on theSphaerain general, which was deployed more and more often over the following centuries and secured the text's usability in higher education despite fundamental changes in astronomy and cosmology. On fol. [H iii r], Fabri notes à propos Sacrobosco's discussion of the precession at the beginning of ch. 4:Et licet auctor dicat, quod in centum annis uno gradu moveatur, loquitur opinione Ptolemaei, quo tempore motus dictus nondum vere fuit inventus.(""And although the author says that the position of the sun changes by one degree every hundred years, he [should not be believed, since he] speaks according to the opinion of Ptolemy, at whose time the truth about the aforesaid change was not found out yet."")The context from which Fabri's work originated as well as its intended readership remain conjectural. One could surmise that Fabri lectured on Sacrobosco in some arts faculty and that he addressed students who had to attend a Sacrobosco class themselves. Occasionally, he indeed sounds like a lecturer, for instance when he begins his introduction with a plural that seems to include himself and his audience:Antequam ad textum tractatus Spere accedamus …(""Before we approach the treatiseOn the Sphere…"").

"Ramazzini, Bernardino",Antiquitatis et novitatis studio medicum perfici oratio sexta habita in Patavino Lyceo a Bernardino Ramazzini practicae medicinae professore. Die decima Novembris 1705,,1705,Modena,Capponi,18th century,Oration,Medicine,Oratio antiquitatis et novitatis studio medicum perfici(Google Books),605039,"As professor of practical medicine at the University of Padua, Bernardino Ramazzini regularly gave lectures to university graduates. ThisOrationwas read in November 1705 on one of such occasions. Upon receiving approval on the part of the University Senate, it consequently found its way to print. Apart from its pedagogical element, what also contributed to the idea of publishing the short text is Ramazzini's reputation as one of the leading medical practitioners of his age.In an eloquent manner, theOrationinvestigates whether ancient medical authorities could still be of any help to early modern physicians. Ramazzini states that contemporary scientific research, mainly in what concerns the study of brain or of heart, might at first glance suggest that the previous medical tradition had become obsolete in its entirety. However, he disagrees with this approach. Admitting that medicine, alongside other disciplines, made a significant step further towards a new scientific and experimental paradigm, Ramazzini at the same time claims that ancient knowledge remains highly valuable, in two instances in particular. First, contemporary medicine is based on the vocabulary and notions first developed by its ancient predecessors; thus, it does not negate but rather advances previous scholarship. In a certain way, Ramazzini argues, this intellectual continuity between the two periods is characteristic of other disciplines, including geography, cosmology or literature. Just as seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century ""novatores"" make cutting-edge discoveries now, so did the ancients, who could similarly have been regarded as ""novatores"" in their age. In this respect, instead of avoiding that tradition, Ramazzini suggests learning from it. Second, in antiquity, medicine was hardly an isolated field of knowledge.

Many of them can be found in four volumes ofSelectae declamationespublished and republished since 1541 in Strasbourg and Basel. Later, they have found their way into volumes 11–12 of Bretschneider'sCorpus Reformatorum.However, the authorship of many specimens is unclear. The titles of the single volumes of the original collection state that Melanchthon authored all orations and let some of them to others to be delivered, and that is also what is assumed in modern literature (Koehn 1985, col. 1289–92;Lindgren 1998, 240–241). By contrast, the letter of dedication by the editor Nikolaus Gerbel to Jakob Milich at the beginning of the first tome expressedly speaks ofaliis harum orationum auctoribus(""other authors of these orations"", fol. Aiiii r, cf. also fol. Aiii r). Presumably, Melanchthon was given sole authorship on the title pages to enhance sales.Whoever wrote the present oration, it was delivered by Georg Joachim Rheticus, for some time professor of mathematics and astronomy at Wittenberg as well as the only pupil of Copernicus (cf. hisNarratio prima). Time and occasion cannot be ascertained, but Rheticus was obliged by his position to speak (Cum autem hoc loco mihi necessitatem dicendi imponat officii ratio …, p. 351). The speech was primarily directed at the students in the academic audience, who are addressed asadolescentes(p. 351).Despite its title, the oration is nearly exclusively concerned with astronomy, while geography is only discussed in a small excursus (pp. 357–358). Rheticus starts from a lament about the desperate political situation in Germany, proceeds to exhort his listeners to study diligently and finally turns to his real subject, astronomy. After some examples of great rulers who favoured the discipline, the main portion of the speech is dedicated to the knowledge of God which the discipline imparts and to its practical usefulness. The final sentence sums up:Cum igitur doctrina de motibus caelestibus plena sit eruditionis, cum sit utilis vitae ad temporum et regionum distinctionem, cum sit dulcissima, cum confirmet in animis honestam de Deo sententiam cumque sit occasio discendi, bona ingenia adhortor, ut in haec studia incumbant et sua et reipublicae causa, cui honestas artes vitae utiles conservare debemus.(""So since the science of the movements in the sky is full of literacy, since it is useful for life as it allows to discern times and regions, since it is very sweet, since it confirms in our minds the fitting opinion about God and since it provides an occasion to learn, I summon all talented minds to dedicate themselves to these studies for their own sake as well as for that of the community, for whom we must preserve the reputable, practically useful skills."") This is wholly in line with Melanchthon's view of the natural sciences in general: they should be pursued not for their own sake, but in order to further piety and the common good.The style appears well tuned towards an audience of listeners, as it is not hard to follow. There is no technical terminology, just a smattering of Greek terms. The syntax is mostly periodic, but the periods are well-structured and easy to understand.

It likewise reflects Melanchthon's views on science and is ascribed to him as the author in theSelectae declamationesand in theCorpus Reformatorum. The ascription seems to be accepted byKoehn 1985, col. 1367, no. 162. However, as in the case of the aforementioned speech,On the Life of Avicennawas probably composed by the scholar who gave it and under whose name it first appeared in print, the physician and mathematician Jakob Milich.The oration was given at the University of Wittenberg at an unspecified academic occasion to a student audience addressed asadolescentes(fol. Cii v). The print version comprises 17 octavo pages. Its introductory part emphasizes the importance of the study of nature as a way towards knowledge of God and as practically useful. However, as nature at large is too big a subject for the speaker, he will turn to the praise of physicians instead, taking Avicenna as an example. In the main part, Avicenna's life is then told in chronological order. Milich draws on the Arab-Latin biographical tradition but enriches it with some freely invented details about Avicenna's purported studies in Alexandria with Rhazes and in Cordoba with Averroes. The account culminates in Avicenna's composition of theCanon, the most important textbook of medieval and early modern medicine, which leads over to an appraisal of his medical achievements in general, while his later life and death are left out. The speaker concludes his talk with an appeal to the students to always venerate the great doctors of old such as Avicenna.The work is remarkable in at least three respects. First, it combines the two literary genres of oration and biography, as it tries to enthuse its audience with a scientific discipline by narrating the life of an outstanding representative. Second, despite some polemics against the godless Arabs, the speaker shows true respect for Arabic science, which is credited with discoveries unknown to the Greeks (fol. Biiii r–v), and paints a very positive picture of Avicenna, who is imagined, inter alia, as an Arab humanist of sorts whose search for truth leads himad fontes, that is, to the study of the Greek classics (fol. Bviii r). Third, the talk displays an extremely conservative view of science based on a Lutheran apocalyptic perspective on human history. Because the end of the world is near, men have become too stolid to find out anything new and the only hope lies in preserving the scientific tradition:In hac delirante mundi senecta non tantum superest vigoris in animis hominum, ut aliquid novi gignere possint; debetis itaque ea, quae ab artificibus Deo praeeunte et monstrante viam tradita sunt, reverenter colere …(fol. Ciii r). While Melanchthon and his allies undoubtedly did much to further the teaching and study of the natural world, they remained completely alien to the modern notion of science, of which the idea of progress is a vital component.","Hofheinz 2001, 160–68 (German translation)Hasse 2015, 285–87Hasse 2016, 55–56","Melanchthon, Philipp‎(← links)Milich, Jakob‎(← links)","Melanchthon, Philipp; Milich, Jakob:Oratio de Avicennae vita, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_de_Avicennae_vita(last revision: 07.06.2021).","Hofheinz 2001, 160 tries to show that M. is sole author from CR 7, 91, but his dates are confused.

In the spring of 1634, the young natural philosopher and astronomer Martinus Hortensius was appointed as a teacher of the mathematical disciplines at theAthenaeum illustrein Amsterdam, a quasi-university that had been founded there shortly before. When he started teaching, he delivered an inaugural lecture, theSpeech about the Dignity and Usefulness of Mathematics. Judging from his opening address, the audience must have been comprehensive, encompassing Amsterdam's political leaders – to whom the printed version is dedicated –, clergy, and academia as well a the merchants who formed the economic backbone of the city. Hortensius obviously tried to rise to the occasion and indeed succeeded in producing an over-average piece of science panegyric. (Academic oratory in general was apparently taken more seriously in the Netherlands than elsewhere; Herman Boerhaave'sSermo academicus de comparando certo(1715) provides a later example of this tendency.)Hortensius' text, which fills a little over 17 neatly printed quarto pages, is clearly structured. The following summary adopts the paragraph and sentence count introduced by Imhausen and Remmert. After a proem, which starts from the person of the speaker, the audience and the occasion and ends with a short, precisepropositio(§I), the body of the talk falls into three sections, the second and third of which are already announced in the title: An introduction to mathematics in general (in the wide sense of the entirety of the disciplines concerned with things numerable and measurable) describes its position between physics and metaphysics, as defined by Aristotle, explains its name and lists its subdisciplines and subjects (§§II–IV). The second section is devoted to the dignity of mathematics, which results from its certainty, antiquity and long history, pleasurable nature, connection to morality and the fact that it was invented by God himself (§§V–VIII). Finally, the lion's share of the oration is taken by the usefulness of mathematics per se as well as in various application areas and subdisciplines (§§IX–XXIII). These comprise theology, law, and medicine, that is, the three higher university faculties, applied arithmetics, surveying, architecture, music, optics, astronomy, chronography, geography, and nautics (which is climactically placed last because of its importance for Amsterdam). The peroration (§§XXIV–XXVII) calls upon the audience to love and promote the mathemtical disciplines. The speaker promises to add his own best efforts.The whole account is undergirt by a wealth of examples from myth, history and everyday life as well as by biblical and classical references and quotations. Hortensius writes a pure, fluent Latin which oscillates between series of short sentences and extended, but clear periods. His dexterousness shows, for instance, in the transition from the main part to the peroration, where navigation and commerce, the subjects of his preceding remarks, are now referred to his own speech in a skilful adaptation of the commonplace likening the production of a literary work to a sea voyage (§XXIV.1):Sed tempus est, ut vela contraham et, dum navigationis commoda prosequor, navem orationis ulterius abripi non sinam.(""But now it is time to reef my sails and not to let the ship of my speech be carried away any further in the pursuit of the advantages of seafaring."")","Imhausen; Remmert 2006(edition with introduction, translation, notes, bibliography)","Hortensius, Martinus‎(← links)","Hortensius, Martinus:Oratio de dignitate et utilitate matheseos, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_de_dignitate_et_utilitate_matheseos(last revision: 20.04.2021).",How much Latin did the merchants have?

Its aim is to sketch a way to restore the lost dignity of the mathematical disciplines. The downfall of mathematics, as Dasypodius tells it, was the vulgarization of the noble and elitist science invented by Adam’s son Seth and perfected by Plato. As mathematics has been corrupted by the ambition of false mathematicians, there now is no place for it in contemporary education. However, Dasypodius shows himself to be confident that the high standard of ancient mathematics can be met again in his times, as his age equals the Greeks – even Plato’s contemporaries – in all respects but mathematics. This can be mended by a Platonic education, where arithmetic, geometry and astronomy – the foundations for the study of philosophy and the preservation of human society – are being learned from an early age (and in a playful fashion at first). The problem is, though, that while there are ancient mathematical authors to study, there is no book on method, telling the reader how, in which order and with which judgement to read mathematical literature. Dasypodius announces his plan to write such an introduction, enumerating what would be necessary to complete his task.

According to theDizionario Biografico degli Italiani, he published this oration twice during his lifetime, first in  a collection ofSphaerae tractatusby various authors (Venice: Giunta, 1531) and in an edition of Ptolemy'sCentiloquium(Centum sententiae interprete Georgio Trapezuntio, Venice: Dorico, 1540). Finally, it was posthumously reprinted as an introduction to Gaurico'sOpera omnia. The present description is based on theOpera omnia, although their text is marred by many misprints.The original speech was given in front of an audience of professors, students and other notables, as the initial address toviri suo quisque ordine clarissimi(""you men most famous in your respective fields"") suggests. Gaurico's patron Cristoforo Madruzzo and Niccolò Leoniceno were present among the listeners (pp. 1, 7). How the occasion may be imagined is shown by a small woodcut adorning page 1.Gaurico starts from his willingness to thank those who promoted him to the professorship and then proclaims mathematics at large to be too wide a field for his speech (pp. 1–2). Therefore, he will focus onastrologia(a term which covers both astronomy and astrology). The main part of the oration provides several definitions of the discipline (p. 2) before progressing to the ""inventors"" announced in the title. These are enumerated in the form of long lists of mythical and historical figures stretching from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt to the present (pp. 2–6). Their  connection to astronomy is in many cases tenuous: Noah, for instance, is named because he had allegedly been able to predict the Flood (p. 3). After that, astronomy's usefulness for all disciplines from grammar to agriculture and architecture is proved (pp. 6–7), and it is shown that the study of the stars was always held in the highest esteem (pp. 7–8). The students will therefore greatly profit fromastrologia, no matter what their future occupations will be (p. 8). In the last paragraph, Gaurico returns to the beginning and again thanks the assembly for the professorship (p. 8).In terms of content, the oration may with some goodwill be counted among the earliest specimens of historiography of science. Apart from that, it contains a number of statements that sound heterodox or simply strange. Adam, for instance, is not only said to have been the first astronomer ever, Gaurico is also unsure ""whether he was an Egyptian or an Assyrian"" (p. 3). Repeatedly (e.g. p. 6), a distintion is made between astronomers who were just ""useful to themselves"" (profuerunt sibi) and others who ""were useful to posterity"" (profuerunt posteris).Astrologiais said to have been taught already ""five thousand years before the Trojan War"" (quinque milibus annorum ante Troianum bellum, p. 8), which contradicts biblical chronology.Stylistically, the speech oscillates between high-flown passages in the framing sections and dry namedropping in the historical part. While some forty names are enumerated in eight lines at the beginning of page 5, astronomy/astrology is praised with massive use of anaphora and polyptoton on page 7:Haec est, qua caelestium corporum formas investigamus. Haec est, qua propius ad Deum ipsum accedimus. Hac futura praescimus et in praedicendo diis similes efficimur.

As this aphorism is hard to understand, Linnaeus explains its meaning in more detail based on hisPhilosophia botanica(p. 3f.) that was, however, first published seven years later in 1751. In theEpistulato Johannes Fredericus Gronovius preceding the actual text of the oration, Linnaeus explains this fact with the need to adapt thePhilosophia botanicabefore publication because Linnaeus feared provoking hostility against him if he would publish his theses unchanged (p. 4; this is work is probably meant bylibellum). He says that he would rather live in peace than vanquish his opponents (Ego potius tranquille vivere desidero, quam ab adversariis victorias et tropaea reportare, p. 4).At the beginning of the letter, Linnaeus states that Gronovius has asked him to send him a copy of theoratiuncula. Moreover, Linnaeus stresses that the oration is not written for orators but for those who love botany. Even for the latter, it might prove inadequate (non rhetoribus scriptam, sed philo-botanicis, nec his, ut vereor, satis dignam; p. 3).

Vorstius' audience comprised university notables, professors and students, but also noblemen and other citizens of Leiden, as is revealed by his initial address tosenatores academici, professores clarissimi, illustres ac generosi barones, viri amplissimi, doctissimi et reverendi, iuventus ornatissima atque reipublicae spes florentissima(p. 3).The speech starts from the double loss suffered by the university (after the recent demise of Joseph Scaliger, de l'Ecluse has now died as well) and the speaker's alleged rhetorical incompetence (pp. 3–5). The main part follows the conventions of the personal encomium, as expressly noted at the outset (p. 5). Vorstius describes de l'Ecluse's hometown Arras and his family, after which his life is narrated in chronological order and with special emphasis on the honorable posts held and the books written by him (pp. 5–14). The penultimate section (pp. 14–17) sums up the non-professional virtues and talents of the deceased, from proficiency in foreign languages to generosity and willingness to help, and briefly tells of his pious death (which was miraculously predicted by the dying Scaliger). Finally, the happiness of de l'Ecluse in heaven is contrasted with the grief of the university members on earth, before Vorstius concludes with a prayer in the name of the university (pp. 17–18).Despite the initial protestations of oratorical inability, Vorstius' mastery of Latin is beyond reproach, and his account is clear and easy to follow. Its beginning and end are more emotional than the calmly flowing narrative parts in between, but all in all, the speaker seems more concerned with sketching a respectable image of de l'Ecluse's life and achievements for posterity than to stir up the feelings of his audience.Two years after its delivery, the oration was included into a volume mainly made up of various posthumous writings of de l'Ecluse. In the context of this book, the speech opens the final section, which unites several commemorative writings: the oration is followed by the epitaph on the deceased's tombstone, an extract from Jean-Jacques Boissard'sIcones virorum illustrium(1597) and 17 funeral poems in Latin and Greek.",,"Vorstius, Aelius Everardus‎(← links)","Vorstius, Aelius Everardus:Oratio funebris in obitum Caroli Clusii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_funebris_in_obitum_Caroli_Clusii(last revision: 07.06.2021).",p. 9: on terminological problems in contemporary botany.p. 11: telling passage on how translations from the vernacular were done.,"DB, MK, IT",Yes,MK,

When Regiomontanus lectured on Alfraganus's work at the University of Padua in 1464, he introduced his course by the present speech, whose title contains the essential information about the occasion. Some 70 years later, it was printed on eleven quarto pages as an introduction to one of the Latin versions of Alfraganus (Hasse 2016, 60–61, 331–333).In the proem, the speaker starts from the situation at hand and confesses, as customary on such occasions, his real or alleged timidity to speak before such an illustrous academic audience. The main part falls into two sections. The former sketches the history of the mathematical disciplines, while the latter sings their praise. In the first section, Regiomontanus starts from geometry and arithmetics before enumerating various kinds of applied mathematics and asserting that astronomy is by far the most important among them. The brief history of the science of the stars contains an excursus on luminaries from Padua and Regiomontanus' teacherGeorg von Peuerbach. Finally, some autobiographical remarks lead up to the speaker's appointment to the present lectureship. In general, the histories of the single disciplines take the form of enumerations of great representatives and always include some bibliographical information. Interestingly, Regiomontanus repeatedly notes that no Latin translation of a particular foreign author is available at the time (see below for an example). The praise section underlines that the mathematical disciplines are useful for many mechanical arts, that their results are more precise and reliable than those of philosophy, and that they attract many great men. Astronomy is singled out for special praise, which is intermingled with criticism of the low esteem in which the discipline is currently held and with exhortations to its study. The oration originally seems to have merged seamlessly into the first lection, since the last sentence of the print version reads:Nunc reliquum est Alfraganum insignem astronomiae historicum ad limina domus uno verbo salutemus.(""It now just remains to extend a short welcome to that excellent researcher in astronomy, Alfraganus, at the doorstep of his house [?]."")The oration is carefully structured, and Regiomontanus sees to it that his readers are able to follow his train of thought (e.g. βv:Stetimus huc usque circa disciplinas primarias, quae videlicet absolutam contemplantur quantitatem.

Regiomontanus is unafraid of the technical terminology of the late medieval university, but such expressions are integrated in a syntax exhibiting the complex yet lucid structure of Ciceronian periods (the opening period is a good example). A sprinkling of Greek words give the speech a learned air that is in line with Regiomontanus' tactful insinuation that he, as opposed to his audience, is able to read Greek (βr):Apollonus autem, ubi in Latinum ex Graeco versus fuerit, nemini vestrum non admirandus veniet(""But Apollonius [of Perge] will prove admirable to all of you as soon as he will have been translated from Greek into Latin"").In sum, the oration is remarkable not only for its famous author, but also as a introduction in humanist style to a quite conventional lecture subject and as an early attempt at (panegyrical) historiography of science.","Schmeidler 1972Rose 1975, 95–98Byrne 2006Zinner 1968, 110-118","Regiomontanus, Johannes‎(← links)","Regiomontanus, Johannes:Oratio habita Patavii in praelectione Alfragani, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_habita_Patavii_in_praelectione_Alfragani(last revision: 22.07.2021).",,"MK, FB",Yes,MK,

Taking its full title into account, it must have been delivered shortly after Grisogono's graduation to doctor of medicine at the University of Padua in 1506/07, after which he taught astrology and mathematics there for one year. The exact occasion is unclear; the generic addresses to the audience ascontio ornatissima(""most illustrous assembly"", p. 8) andpatres optimi(""excellent fathers"", p. 22) are of no help in this respect. The element of self-presentation in the speech (see below) would be appropriate, for instance, in an inaugural lecture such as professors were used to give after their appointment, but this must remain speculative.The oration's structure and content are a bit puzzling. It starts like an autobiography, sketching Grisogono's life from the moment when he became an orphan at the age of five to his studies in Padua (pp. 8–10), but soon, the speech turns into a praise of themathematicae, that is, the disciplines of the quadrivium, especially of astrology (pp. 10–24). In a somewhat confused way, they are shown to be necessary for the acquisition of practical abilities, for one's health and one's soul (faciunt enim ad facultatem, ad sanitatem et ad animam, p. 16 l. 4–5).The style is difficult to charaterise, since many grammatically hard or faulty sentences induce one to believe that the text has reached us in a state of considerable depravation. In any case, the oration ends with a conspicuous and highly emotional speech figure, namely with a prosopopoeia (pp. 22–24): The mathematics are introduced as speaking persons and tearfully  berate humankind for neglecting them.",,"Grisogono, Federico‎(← links)Speculum astronomicum‎(← links)Girardi-Karšulin; Perić; Čepulić 2007‎(← links)","Grisogono, Federico:Oratio in Academia Patavina habita, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_in_Academia_Patavina_habita(last revision: 08.02.2022).",,MK,,MK,

The date of the oration is recorded on the title page and translates to 28th April 1751 (day and month are given according to the Roman calendar). The title of the oration isThe Friendly Marriage of Natural History and Medicine, a choice that is perhaps inspired by the late antiqueMarriage of Philology and Mercury(De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii), an allegory on education attributed to Martianus Capella.The opening address of the speechs indicates that Lambergen's audience comprised the curators of the university, the rector, the professors, the secretaries of the curators and of the academic senate, members of the local elite, priests, doctors and doctoral candidates, the students of the university as well as other listeners from Franeker and abroad. The Prince of Orange William IV, the main dedicatee of the printed oration, was absent, but is nonetheless addressedin absentiam(pp. 63–67).In light of his diverse audience, Lambergen reflects on his choice of topic (pp. 5–6): he did not want to choose a topic that would only be understood by medical experts, but by all listeners, but he did not want to dedicate his oration to the necessity, origin and profess of medicine either, because that would take too long. Therefore, Lambergen announces, he will only a bit about the usefulness and excellence of medicine before turning to his main topic: the relationship of natural history and medicine. In fact, however, the panegyric on medicine (pp. 11–42) is longer than titular marriage between natural history and medicine (pp. 42–63). In the introduction, Lambergen likened his oration to the plucking of tender litte flowers from here and there, thus marking it as an eclectic stroll through the topic that would not last longer than one hour (teneros hinc inde legendo flosculos, intra brevis horulae curriculum iter conficiam, p. 10).Before he turns to the main part of the speech, Lambergen confesses his weakness as an orator (pp. 6–11) – a topos of modesty that is often in itself a display of the very rhetorical skills that the orator claims he does not possess. Lambergen's take on the topos however, gives this supposed lack of rhetorical skills a biographical (and professional) background: having spent in the silent and lonely rooms of bed-ridden patients, he – a shy person in general – now finds himself giving his first public speech.In the end, the oration offers the audience not only the promisedvarietasin terms of content, but also stylistic ornaments and high pathos. As it is addressed to a broader audience, the oration never delves into complicated details. Instead, it offers vivid examples and allusions to classical literature, which would have been familiar to all Latinate listeners. While he polemicises against those who put theorizing (pp. 55–58) and authority (p. 63) above the observation of nature, he praises medicine and natural history and their present level. Three figures are singled out to highlight the intricate connection of medicine and natural history:William HarveyandMarcello Malpighi(pp. 47–48) and, as the towering figure of medicine,Herman Boerhaave(pp. 58–60). Finally, the long series of closing addresses (p. 63–79) descends from the Prince of Orange to the students. Lambergen dwells the longest on them, advertising himself as an engaged teacher and mentor (pp. 72–79).Only a few years after his inauguration in Franeker, Lambergen became professor of medicine, botany and chemistry at the University of Groningen. The inaugural oration in praise of botany and its usefulness for medicine that he gave there also appeared inprint.",,"Lambergen, Tiberius‎(← links)","Lambergen, Tiberius:Oratio inauguralis de amico historiae naturalis cum medicina connubio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_inauguralis_de_amico_historiae_naturalis_cum_medicina_connubio(last revision: 05.03.2021).",,,Yes,IT,

As the titleDe deo mathematicorum  principeindicates, the oration holds that God is the foremost of mathematicians. However, this main topic is introduced only in § 5. Before, the oration tackles a related question of direct relevance to the newly-appointed professor Funk: whether a man of the church should teach mathematics (§§ 1–4). In this apologetic first part, Funk vindicates his new position, which organically leads to the main topic of the oration: why should a theologian not devote some of his time to mathematics, when God has practised mathematics from the beginnings of the world (§ 4)?Since it is impossible to give a full account of the perfect mathematical theory and praxis of an omniscient and omnipotent being, Funk gives his audience an impression of the excellence of divine mathematics by going through the most common mathematical branches and selecting one or two examples from each (§ 6). The following main part of the oration is structured by mathematical disciplines: arithmetics (§§ 7–10), geometry (§§ 11–12), algebra (§§ 13–14), mechanics (§§ 15–17), optics (§ 18), architecture (§ 19), astronomy and geography (§§ 20–23), chronology (§§ 24–25) and gnomonics (§ 26).This structure allows Funk to show himself familiar with the different areas of mathematics and its prominent figures in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (he mentions e.g. Newton, Leibniz, Descartes and Jacob Bernoulli). At the same time, Funk's definition of ""divine mathematics"" proves to be very broad. For example, God's perfect arithmetical skills find expression in the fact that he could make so many different faces from the same components (§ 9). God's geometrical skill, on the other hand, is reflected in the spherical shape of raindrops and thehexagonal shape of snowflakes(§ 11), but also in his effortless understanding of infinitesimal calculus, even if he does not need it (§ 12).The oration ends with a prayer to God, demonstratingin actuhow mathematical considerations lead to piety and awe (§ 27). Indeed, in the preface of the entire volume, Funk had stated that his intention was to give his students an example of how philosophical and mathematical studies must be directed towards the glory of God (§ 8).When Funk announces to treat his topictenui sermone(§ 5), this could be an allusion to Horace'sSatires2.4.9 (utpote res tenuis, tenui sermone peractas, ""namely subtle topics, treated in a thorough form""). While the introduction and the conclusion of the oration are steeped in rhetoricpathosand rhetorical figures (e.g. in the first paragraph, the listener or reader can detect anaphora, tricolon, antithesis, parallelism, rhetoric question, wordplay and the device of thefictus interlocutor), the main part is presented in a simpler style. Funk uses a handful of Greek words in his speech, but provides the two longer Greek quotes both in the original and in Latin translation (§ 11 and § 24), displaying his knowledge of Greek without requiring it from his audience.In 1716,De deo mathematicorum principewas printed in the appendix of Funk'sLiber de coloribus caeli, a treatise on the colours of the sky. Thus, Funk seems to have seized the opportunity of the publication of his treatise to publish his inaugural oration as well. It did not see another edition.",,"Funk, Johann Kaspar‎(← links)","Funk, Johann Kaspar:Oratio inauguralis de deo mathematicorum principe, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_inauguralis_de_deo_mathematicorum_principe(last revision: 10.09.2021).",,,Yes,IT,
"Barrow, Isaac","Oratio praefatoria, Martio 14., 1664","Isaaci Barrow, mathematicae professoris Lucasiani, lectiones habitae in scholis publicis Academiae Cantabrigensis anno Domini MDCLXIV, pp. i–xxxvii",1683,London,Playford,17th century,Oration,Mathematics,Oratio praefatoria(Google Books),702144,"Prefixed to the posthumous edition of Isaac Barrow'sMathematicae professoris Lucasiani lectiones, one finds thisIntroductory Talk. Barrow, the first holder of the prestigious Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics at Cambridge, gave this oration around the time when he stepped up to his new position in front of an audience of colleagues and students (academici). On which occasion exactly he did so is not entirely clear, as the date of the speech, March 14th 1664, falls in the lent term (cf. the allusion to fasting on p. xxxvii), while the introductory statement that a calm period has begun (Ut conquieverit paulo solemnium negotiorum aestus …) points to a time of recess. However this may be, its circumstances and part of its subject matter make this oration the equivalent of an inaugural lecture, although it is not formally called so.Thematically, the text is quite heterogeneous. After a proem announcing great and joyful novelties, it falls into three clearly distinct parts: Part one (pp. i–xxi) is an encomium of the clergyman and politician Henry Lucas, who had died the year before, leaving to the University his personal library and the funds for the new professorship; the academic officials who helped to implement Lucas' plans are also included in Barrow's praise. In the second part (pp. xxi–xxvii), which sounds like an attempt to counter or prevent criticism, Barrow explains why he swapped the Greek chair, which he had hold since 1660, for the new Lucasian Professorship. In part three (pp. xxvii–xxxvii), an exhortation to the students to apply themselves to the study of mathematics leads over to a hymnical praise of this discipline. The speech concludes with a nicely self-ironic twist: The tedium caused by his long speech, Barrow says, is a good preparation for what the students will have to endure during his lessons. But since mathematicians are in general bad orators (an idea of unclear origin), his rhetorical incapacity is at least to his credit as a mathematician.The most interesting part in terms of content as well as of rhetorical form is the final one, the hymn to mathematics. Mathematics, Barrow asserts, has always attracted the greatest minds from Pythagoras to Descartes. It is far superior to the trivium and to classical studies. Its proofs provide absolutely certain knowledge. All useful and lofty disciplines from architecture to cosmology depend on it. Mathematics trains and disciplines the mind as well as the character; it abstracts one's thoughts from earthly matters and directs them towards the divine. In order to adequately convey these notions, Barrow raises to a higher level of style than in the previous parts. The praise of mathematics is presented in a series of periods extending over several pages and structured by cola which are held together by parallelism, rhythm and assonance. When Barrow advises the students to improve their notoriously bad reputation by turning to mathematics, for instance, this sounds as follows (pp. xxx–xxxi):Quae in vos … congesta opprobria vel eluatis facile vel omnino devitetis, divinam modo Mathesin qua par est diligentia consectemini, Mathesin subtilitate non spinosa, difficultate neutiquam perplexa, disquisitione minime contentiosa studiosos animos exercentem valide, non vane deludentem, non anxie discruciantem, sine pugna vincentem, sine pompa triumphantem, absque vi cogentem, citra iacturam libertatis absolute dominantem …(""All these … shameful charges you meet with you would easily refute or avoid altogether, if only you would follow the divine Lady Mathematics with proper diligence – Mathematics, who, with finesse which is not thorny, with difficulty not complicated, with scrutiny far from strive mightily exercises the minds of students, without empty mockery, without fearful torture, victorious without battle, triumphant without pomp, cogent without force, ruling sovereignly without any loss of freedom …""). All in all, this is presumably one of the most powerful assertions of the importance of mathematics and its leading role among the sciences to be found in early modern literature.",,"Barrow, Isaac‎(← links)Mathematicae professoris Lucasiani lectiones‎(← links)Praelectio de matheseos usu in theologia‎(← links)","Barrow, Isaac:Oratio praefatoria, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_praefatoria(last revision: 22.07.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

It thus was printed some 15 years after its delivery (for a similarly delayed publication, see Luca Gaurico'sOratio de inventoribus, utilitate et laudibus astronomiae). Its title,Speech for the Idea of Method, alludes to the notion that mathematics incarnates the very idea of methodical reasoning, as explained on fol. 6r. The text is printed in an elegant cursive font, but features no paratexts apart from the title.The short oration (seven folia, i.e. 14 pages) rolls along in stylish periods (pace Catena's protestation of stylistic austerity, fol. 3r) and is clearly structured. It begins with the promise to treat in extenso the dignity of mathematics and very briefly Catena's efforts at teaching it (fol. 2r–2v), and this promise is kept. The praise of mathematics is subsumed under three headings: its certainty (certitudo), its noble subject and its usefulness (fol. 3r–v). Mathematics' certainty is accounted for by its combination of intellectual content and accessibility to the senses, by the immediate assent which its principles command and by the clarity of its reasoning (fol. 3v–7v). The nobility of the subject of the two branches of mathematics, arithmetics, and geometry is demonstrated by the fact that they treat universals and are capable of causal explanation, and by disciplines like astronomy, music and perspective which depend on them (fol. 7v–8r). Mathematic's utility is so obvious and pervasive that nothing needs to be said about it (fol. 8r-v). At the very end, the speaker briefly promises to fulfil his duty as a teacher as best he can and thanks the listeners for their patience (fol. 8v).As far as Catena's speech asserts that mathematics is capable of causal explanation and able to elucidate various aspects of the physical world, it plays an important role in the so-calledQuaestio de certitudine mathematicarum, in which (despite its misleading name) the applicability of mathematics to the natural world was discussed. The answering of theQuaestioin Catena's sense, that is, in the affirmative, opened the door for the mathematization of nature that was a conditio sine qua non of the Scientific Revolution.",,"Catena, Pietro‎(← links)Additamentum de natura scientiarum mathematicarum‎(← links)Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum‎(← links)","Catena, Pietro:Oratio pro idea methodi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oratio_pro_idea_methodi(last revision: 22.06.2021).","The last paragraph of the description summarizes a talk given by David Miller in Bucharest on March 14th 2018.

"Saussure, Horace Bénédict de",[Oration on glaciers],,1764,,,18th century,Oration,Meteorology/Earth sciences,not availalbe,not available,"This is a short oration of the young Saussure, which covers less than five pages and was only preserved in manuscript (cf. edition). It was held in 1764 in front of the Académie de Genève and offers, for the first time, basic hypotheses on glaciers. At the beginning of the oration, a young student of philosophy asks about these miraculous glaciers, especially their formation and conservation. A discourse then answers the question, describing in much details the glaciers of Chamonix and explaining many phenomena related to them. The most important ones are that ice from the glacier is formed by snow and, more importantly, that glaciers move or flow – and therefore also have a glacier bed (alveus).The style is exuberant. Saussure cites or alludes to Horace (esp.Odes) and Vergil (GeorgicsandAeneid) on several occasions. His vivid descriptions of the glaciers and their ice formations (e.g. p. 48) are reminiscent of classical laudatory orations. Saussure clearly feels aesthetically attracted to his subject and manages well to convey his fascination to his listeners.
Although Saussure's speech was not printed manuscript for more than two centuries, it nonetheless attracted some attention. At some point before 1912, it was translated into French. The translation is inaccurate and sometimes misleading (Carozzi; Newman 1995, 54–56).","Carozzi; Newman 1995, 44-56 (edition, translation, translation of the French translation)","Montium glacialium Helveticorum descriptio‎(← links)Saussure, Horace Bénédict de‎(← links)","Saussure, Horace Bénédict de:Oration on glaciers, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Oration_on_glaciers(last revision: 08.02.2022).",,MK,,JL,"Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire de Genève, Archives Saussure, Ms. 99–3"

Second, the work pursues economic rather than learned interests. Instigated by several famous Dutch cartographer-publishers, namely the Blaeu family, Jan Janssonius and Nicolaes Visscher I (fol. *3v,consilio atque instinctu vestro), compiled and published by the learned printer-publisher Simon Pauli, it advertises the maps listed in it in order to attract buyers.

The items listed are divided into marine and terrestrial maps. The latter are further differentiated into maps illustrating sacred and profane history and maps of the contemporary world.

The presentOrder, and Reason for this Order, in Which the Books by Hippocrates and Galen Should Be Read, composed by the renowned French physician Jacques Dubois (Jacobus Sylvius), is an early example which restricts itself to the two giants of classical medicine. In doing so, the work conforms to the early modern tendency to purify the Greeks classics from Arabic and other medieval accretions which was particularly pronounced in 16th century Paris and of which Dubois was a major representative. Indeed, he expressedly states that Galen's and Hippocrates' medicine is the most perfect one (fol. a6r:quibus medicina est absolutissima).The better part of the dedication to a member of the council of Paris (fols. A2r–a3v) occupies itself with a praise of order in general. Towards its end, Dubois mentions Galen'sDe ordine librorum suorum, which is extant in mutilated form only. In composing the present work, he intends to make good for this loss. His book will not only serve as a ""most certain and sure guide to the way that should be kept in the perusal of medical books"" (dux quidam certissimus et tutissimus viae in legendis medicorum libris servandae), but may also be used as a kind of exam book with whose help sham doctors can be exposed.The reading list itself comprises some 30 octavo pages. It starts from some remarks on the formation of the future doctor in general, which lead on to books to be read by the would-be student who is not  enrolled at the university yet (fols. a4r–a5v). On fol. a5v, formal teaching begins:legat(""he may read"") is replaced bydoceri possunt(""[the following books] can be taught""), and the apprentice is calledauditorinstead ofmedicinae auditor futurus(""future student of medicine"").Doceri possuntimplies that in addition to the uses adduced in the dedication, Dubois also intends to provide the academic teacher with suggestions on which works to lecture, an inference confirmed at the end of the treatise (see below). Subsequently, medicine is subdivided intophysiologia(the doctrine of the nature of the human body),hygieine(the doctrine how to stay healthy), andtherapeutice(the doctrine of healing; fols. a7r–a8v), to be discussed in this order. Books pertaining tophysilogiaare treated on fols. a8v–b4r, those onhygieineon fols. b4r–5r, and therapeutical ones on fols. b5r–c2v. At the end (fols. c2v–c3r), Dubois admits that it is impossible to lecture on all the works adduced by him, and presents a rigorously abridged list of 14 titles, on which he apparently intends to base his own teaching (Nobis igitur interpretandi sunt …). If the student has heard his lectures on these, he will easily be able to understand the other works for himself. (For a similar accentuation of the absolutely essential within a larger body of information in a textbook, one may compare the use made of asterisks and brackets byMichael Mästlinin later editions of hisEpitome astronomiaein order to distinguish contents suiting beginners and advanced students respectively.)Dubois' order of presentation does not differentiate between works by Hippocrates and Galen (who is far more prominent in his account), but is based on content only. When contemporary works are mentioned, as happens occasionally, they usually come in for criticism (e.g. fols. b2v–3r, coupled with interesting polemics against illustrations in medical books). As befits the work of a man who also was a renowned grammarian and wrote one of the first grammars of French, the book list has a marked philological slant. Time and again, Dubois identifies works as genuine or spurious or details in which Latin translation they should be read. The backbone of his account is a simple catalogue of works listed one after the other, as in a modern bibliography. Some items attract a shorter or longer comment like the following (fol. bv):Introductio seu medicus, Herodoti liber, non Galeni, ut ex commentario Galeni 31. particulae secundae libri sexti Epidemion liquido apparet.Introduction or The Doctor, a book by Herodotus, not Galen, as becomes absolutely clear from Galen's commentary no. 31 on section two of book six of theEpidemics.Some comments regard a whole group of works, which is indicated by curly brackets. Such brackets are also used otherwise to unite works having something in common. Sometimes, the catalogue form is interrupted by longer discursive passages, as on fols. b4r–v, where Dubois looks back at the physiological part just finished and ahead to thehygieinesection.The work apparently fulfilled a widespread need for orientation, since it was published at least four times, in 1539 (in Paris, unclear if before or after the present edition), 1541, 1549, and 1561. The 1549 edition proclaims on its title page to have been ""recently revised and enriched by the author"" (iam recens ab auctore recognitus et locupletatus).",,"Dubois, Jacques‎(← links)","Dubois, Jacques:Ordo et ordinis ratio in legendis Hippocratis et Galeni libris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ordo_et_ordinis_ratio_in_legendis_Hippocratis_et_Galeni_libris(last revision: 12.05.2022).",Date of publication and publisher taken from VD 16.,MK,Yes,MK,

It resulted from Brisson’s work in René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's collection, as Brisson highlights in the French preface. In this preface, the author also mentions his earlier work, theRegnum animale in classes IX distributumof 1756, in which he had already outlined his taxonomical system. Moreover, Brissot shortly mentions and characterizes the most important works on birds in the early modern period and explains how these works differ from his ownOrnithologia. Among these are the books byPierre Belon,Conrad Gessner,Ulisse Aldrovandi,Francis Willughby,Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, andGeorg Marggraf. Most notably, Brisson refers to the important tenth edition ofCarolus Linnaeus’sSystema naturae. Brisson criticises some details in taxonomy, but especially Linnaeus’s short accounts on the species that do not allow for identification. This is something that he is going to improve with much longer descriptions of bird species and with a fair number of engravings by François Nicolas Matinet. After the preface follows acatalogus auctorum. Moreover, there is a dichotomous key that helps the readers with the identification as it guides them to a certain species (p. 25–61) similar to that in Willughby’sOrnithologiae libri tres. As with the rest of the book, this key is bilingual (uneven numbered pages in French; even numbered pages in Latin). With regard to Brisson’s taxonomy: There are 26ordines, that are subdived intosectiones,genera,species, and at timesvarietatesof thesespecies. The dichotomous key guides to the level ofgenera. Important characteristics are the form of feet, head, and beaks.The entries on the species have the following form: There is a French name as heading. Then follows a short description in Latin with the (mostly binominal) scientific name of the bird. After this, Brisson gives references and a detailed description. Sometimes synonyms (also from other vernaculars) are mentioned. The descriptions are bilingual and in two columns: The French column is always on the outside, the Latin on the inside of the page, i.e. the French column is on the right in uneven numbered pages, and on the left in even numbered pages; the Latin column vice versa.
At the end, there is a table of content (again in two columns), followed by an index of French names and another index of names in all languages (French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, other vernaculars). This structure is basically the same in all volumes although volumes II to VI start directly with the description of the respectiveordines(i.e. without dedication, preface, etc.).
The Latin is clear, but given the content, rather brief and technical. Quite a few names have been coined by Brisson. At times, he states so explicitly (e.g. in a footnote).","Bäumer 1991–1996, vol. 3, 390–391","Brisson, Mathurin-Jacques‎(← links)Regnum animale in classes IX distributum‎(← links)","Brisson, Mathurin-Jacques:Ornithologia - Ornithologie, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ornithologia_-_Ornithologie(last revision: 28.08.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

It was published by his friend and teacherJohn Raywho also issued an augmented English translation two years later. As the full title indicates this work is meant to contain all bird species known at that time and present them and theirnaturain a systematic way. There is, in fact, a new classification system based on anatomical features and moreover, a dichotomous key that helped the readers with the identification as it guided them to a certain species. This key can be found at the end of the firs book. Such dichotomous keys are still in use in modern classification books.There is a substantialpraefatioby Ray in which he first gives a short biography of Willughby and praises him and his skills as scientist. Moreover, Ray states that he is fulfilling the will of the author in publishing his almost finished works and announces that there are alsoHistoriaeon quadrupeds, fish, and insects that he plans to publish later (which he did). Ray then goes on to talk about important predecessors and how Willughby’s approach differs from them.Gessner’s andAldrovandi’s works on ornithology are acknowledged as important works, however, Ray clearly states that Willughby got rid of any mythological, symbolical, or moral lore that is contained in these older works and focusses primarily on the biology of the animals. Some more works are mentioned that served as important sources such asClusius’sExoticorum libri decem,Marggraf’s andPiso’sHistoria naturalis Brasiliae, orNieremberg’sHistoria naturae, maxime peregrinae. As to the names, Ray states that these were kept wherever possible, and he remarks about the style that they did rather take care that the sense is clear than for pure Latin (De oratione quoque et stylo non admodum solliciti fuimus maiorem utique curam adhibentes, ut sententia perspicua esset, quam aut sermo purus aut voces Latinae.).
The ornithology is divided into three books. The first book offers some general facts about birds (such as external and internal organs, propagation, properties, etc.), lists further research questions by Willughby, presents the classification system together with the already mentioned dichotomous key. Moreover, there is a chapter on British islands in which maritime bird species breed, and on birds in Britain. Books two and three deal with terrestrial and aquatic birds respectively. The single entries contain the names of the birds, at times together with vernacular (mostly English) synonyms, and describe mostly the outward appearance. The sources are discussed and it is stated where and if the bird has been seen by the author. Birds that have not been seen by the author himself are marked with an asterisk. 
The work is completed by some 80 plates with engravings that have been paid for by the Willughby’s widow, Emma, as is acknowledged on the title page.",,"Willughby, Francis‎(← links)Ray, John‎(← links)Ornithologia - Ornithologie‎(← links)","Willughby, Francis; Ray, John:Ornithologiae libri tres, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ornithologiae_libri_tres(last revision: 22.09.2021).",,DB,Yes,DB,

Monographia(Google Books),605287,"This work by one of the leading Austrian botanists of his time is dedicated exclusively to the genus called ""Oxalis"" by Linné and still known under this name today. It falls into three parts. After a short description of the genus in general (including an overview in the form of a Ramist chart, a list of those characteristics which unambiguously identify each single species and a list of synonyms, pp. 1–20), 96 species – of many hundreds known today – are first described in words (pp. 21–120) and then represented in delicately coloured drawings.The book is a typical product of its time, when the Linnean classification and binary nomenclature had gained general acceptance and researchers strove to describe the whole living world according to Linné's programme in ever more sober, standardised, detailed and exhaustive works. Jacquin's descriptions follow the model of his great Swedish predecessor (cf.Stearn 1992, 36–38) and elaborate on it. They are given in a highly technical language; readers are expected to understand such subtle differences as the one betweenovatumandovale(p. 21;Stearn 1992, 459). For the most part, only nominal phrases are used. Each species is discussed according to the same scheme, starting from the root and proceeding upwards to the reproductive organs, after which the blooming period and the habitat are indicated. This order is underlined by a recurring sequence of capitalised keywords:RADIX(""ROOT"") –CAULIS(""STALK"") –FOLIA(""LEAVES"") –PEDUNCULI(""PETIOLES"") –CALYX–COROLLA–GENITALIA(""REPRODUCTIVE PARTS"") –FLORET(""BLOSSOMS"") –PATRIA(""HABITAT"").The opening paratexts are reduced to a bare minimum: a poem in eight hexameters in which Jacquin identifies the analysis of the reproductive organs as the only way to classify the many species of Oxalis, and a laconic dedication to the Swedish botanist Carl Peter Thunberg (CAROLO PETRO THUNBERG HANC MONOGRAPHIAM DICAT AUTOR), who has provided Jacquin with some specimens which did not grow in Vienna (pp. 1–2).Although the work's structure and overall make clearly continue the tradition of theHistoriae plantarumandFloraeof preceding centuries, it is called amonographiaon its title page because of its restriction to one single genus. The respective subgenre had been introduced into botanical literature much earlier with Robert Morision'sPlantarum umbelliferarum distributio nova. Its designation presumably goes back to the 13th aphorism of Linnaeus'Fundamenta botanica, where botanists describing one single taxon in detail are calledmonographi. There are many examples of this word usage from contemporary and slightly later works of botany and zoology. The modern term ""monograph"" may well have originated from there.",Stearn 1992,"Jacquin, Nikolaus Joseph von‎(← links)Plantarum umbelliferarum distributio nova‎(← links)","Jacquin, Nikolaus Joseph von:Oxalis.

The publication of Commandino's translation, which he had left essentially finished but lacking the last corrections at the moment of his death, was delayed for thirteen years because of disputes between his two daughters. Finally, the volume was published by Commandino's son-in-law Valerio Spacciolo and dedicated to Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, who had been taught mathematics by Commandino and financed the endeavour. Before, his Latin translations of Euclid'sElements, works ofPtolemy,Archimedeshad been published.After the letter of dedication and a short address to the reader (who is asked to make any necessary corrections himself, since the work has not been revised by the editor), the translation itself fills over 300 folia (600 pages). Pappus' difficult, technical Greek is rendered with admirable clarity; moreover, Commandino tacitly or explicitly emends the Greek text in many places (Hultsch 1876–1878, vol. 1, XVII–XVIII). The text, structured by theorems and propositions in a way that reminds one of Euclid'sElements, is also provided with marginalia and diagrams (and images of technical devices in book 8). Each proposition is followed by Commandino's commentary, linked to the text by a key of majuscules (A, B, C, D etc.)A fragment of book two unknown to Commandino was published in 1688 byJohn Wallis. Nonetheless, Commandino's translation, which was reprinted in 1589 and 1602 and appeared in a second, deteriorated edition in 1660, remained the standard text of the Συναγωγή, until Friedrich Hultsch undertook the first edition of the complete Greek text, accompanied by a new Latin translation, in the 1870s (Hultsch 1876–1878).","Commentary comparatively concise.

The work is divided into three books. The first deals withmateriae medicae, the second with illnesses and diseases in a broader sense, and the third with anatomy. In theEpistula nuncupatoriato Duke Ulrich of Württemberg, Fuchs explains his motivation to write this work and highlights the difficulties in working with his ancient sources as so many technical terms have become unknown and not all texts are available in a reliable edition.

The proems of the second and the third book are similar. At the beginning of the first chapter of book one, Fuchs explains the structure of his work: every chapter starts with a literary quotation of a – in his opinion – wrong thesis. He then refutes this thesis with quotation from reliable authorities (Hippocrates and Galen in particular; therefore, there are longer passages in Greek) and – if necessary – tries to corroborate this refutation with his own ideas.

In the title, he somewhat mysteriously calls himself a teacher (praeceptor) of John George, Elector of Brandenburg, who was already over seventy at the time.ThePhalaecian Hendecasyllables on the Chymists, Addressed to Libaviuscreate a sense of intimacy between poet and addressee by three affectionate vocatives, the first and last of which frame the entire poem. In terms of content, the text focusses on one single virtue of Libavius' work: It makes chymistry understandable. This claim is impressively presented in the form of two negative catalogues consisting of one single rambling sentence each and comprising 25 lines between them, more than two thirds of the entire poem. They enumerate meaningless names (such asleo virens, ""green lion"" orrebis, v. 11) and nonsensical concepts (among whose inventors ""futile Paracelsus"" is singled out for special blame, v. 24), which Praetorius can quietly unlearn after the perusal of theAlchemia Libavii. Subsequently (vv. 26–29), the author underlines his point by a verbatim quotation from Martial 2.86.9–10:turpe est difficiles habere nugas / et vanus labor est ineptiarum(""shameful it is to concern oneself with difficult inanities, and vain is work invested in mischief""). In the last lines (vv. 30–35), Libavius' lucidity is contrasted with thetenebras obscuras(""dark blackness"") of his fellow chymists (spagyrûm). As Praetorius pointedly concludes, Libavius replaces all of them in his eyes:Ergo iure tuo mihi vel unus, / unus instar es omnium, Libavi.The poem is an elegant variation on the widespread lament over the obscurity of chymical writing.

Ad mandatum Sacrae Caesareae Regiaeque Apostolicae Maiestatis,,1794,Vienna,Christian Friedrich Wappler,18th century,"Other (see description), Compendia",Medicine,Pharmacopoea Austriaco-Provincialis emendata(Google Books)Alternative link:MDZ,906184,"While pharmacopoeias were composed by doctors and pharmacists on their own private initiative until the end of the Middle Ages, cities began to commission such works and to declare their prescriptions legally binding from the 16th century. From the 18th century, principalities and bigger countries took over this trend (seeSchmitz; Friedrich; Müller-Jahncke 1998–2005, vol. 2, 195–214, 404–408, 572–582). The presentCorrected Pharmacopoeia for Austria and Its Provincesprovides an example of such a national pharmacopoeia. (Another item, from the late 19th century, is thePharmacopoea Germanica).  As hinted at by its title'semendata, it replaced the earlierPharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis(1774), and as indicated by the subtitle, it did so at the order of Emperor Francis II. The task was executed by a team of seven prestigious doctors and pharmacists, who appear as signatories of the preface. The prescriptions of theCorrected Pharmacopoeiawere legally binding from the the first of January 1796, as specified by aimperial decree. At least one further simultaneous edition is on record (Milan: Galeazzi, 1794), and others may have been printed in the major cities of the Danube Monarchy.The preface explains the appearance of the new pharmocopoeia, which is ""in the interest of public utility and safety"" (utilitati et saluti publicae, p. IV), with the rapid progress made by medicine and chemistry in recent years. About the earlier pharmacopoeia supplanted by the present one, no clear indications are given. The present book's rationale and structure is explained: It contains the simples commonly in use which every pharmacist must have in store and the recipes of the drugs made thereof which he must be able to prepare. Outdated medications have been left out; they may be found in the previous pharmocopoeia. Drugs used but rarely or not sufficiently tested at present are relegated to an appendix. The names of drugs and chemical compounds have been brought up to date. In accordance with a governmental decree, no symbols are used for substances and weights.After a table ofpondera pharmaceutica(""pharmaceutical weights""), the work's first part (pp. 5–44) provides a list of c. 300 simples in alphabetical order. Each simple is given with its pharmaceutical, its botanical (if it is a plant, as in most cases) and its common German name, and the parts to be  stored are specified. Part two (pp. 45–146) provides, again in alphabetical order, some 300 recipes of composite drugs. They are followed by the aforementioned appendix of less common simples and drugs, which must not be stored in every pharmacy (pp. 147–162). After this, two tables detail the quantities of certain salts soluble in an ounce of water and the concentration of mercury, antimony and opium in certain drugs respectively (pp. 163–166). A copious index (pp. 167–195) makes the book easy to consult.While some recipes are presented as running text, the majority mostly consists of lists of ingredients. The language is syntactically much reduced and rich in technical terminology. The various operations to be performed are prescribed exclusively in the 3rd person passive jussive, which sounds sober, impersonal and 'scientific'. Formulaic repetitions such assolvaturorservetur(""may be solved / stored"") abound. Some unclassical features such asana(< Gr. ἀνά) for ""in each case"" are taken from ancient pharmaceutical language.In terms of content, the reader may encounter on the same page drugs still in use today and distinctly archaic.

The German Pharmacopœia(English translation, 1873)",604277,"Following a trend originating in the 18th century and exemplified by works like thePharmacopoea Austriaco-Provincialis emendata, efforts were made from the 1850s to create a pharmacopoeia for the whole of Germany. After the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, the need for legally binding work of this kind was felt even more urgently. The task of composing such a compendium for the newly unified nation was assigned to a commission presided by the Pomerian physician Karl Housselle (Schmitz; Friedrich; Müller-Jahncke 1998–2005, 579). Elaborating on earlier pharmacopoeias, the commission swiftly and efficiently completed its work, which was published anonymously in 1872.Right after the title page, the reader encounters an announcement in German, made in the name of the imperial chancellor Bismarck, which sanctions the book's validity for the entire territory of the Empire. Next, the work's gestation, structure, and purpose are explained in a preface, along with the choice of language (p. VII):Latinum denique sermonem, et quia ubique intellegitur et quod medici praecepta sua Latine scribere consuerunt, retinendum esse putavimus.""Finally, we thought we must stick with Latin, because it is understood everywhere and because doctors are used to writing their recipes in Latin.""After a list of the abbreviations and atomic weights of important elements, the pharmacopoeia proper begins. On 386 pages, over 900 medications are described in alphabetical order according to their Latin names. This arrangement implies that drugs of the same dosage form as well as from the same plant component stand together, since their names usually start from the respective designations (for instance,emplastrum ammoniaciorfolia aurantii). Simples and composite medicines, by contrast, are mixed up. Moreover, this traditional dichotomy has become a trichotomy, since numerous chemically produced medications have entered the canon. They form a third class of drugs, which are de facto composite, but simples from the viewpoint of the pharmacist who buys them from a chemical factory. Together with the conventional simples, the chemical drugs are simply described with regard to their texture, colour, form, taste and smell; often, hints are added how to recognize good quality. The recipes of the composite drugs to be prepared by the pharmacists themselves, which make up about half of all medications, follow a clear structure underlined by a uniform layout. After the Latin name, which is usually supplemented by a German one and often by Latin synonyms, the  openingR(ecipe)is followed by an enumeration of the ingredients and their ratios (instead of absolute weights) and by indications how to prepare the medicine. At the end, it is in most cases explained how the final product should look like and how it must be preserved. However, many recipes are shortened with reference to similar drugs described earlier. Aboutemplastrum hyoscamior ""Bilsenkrautpflaster"" (""henbane plaster"", p. 100), for example, it is only stated:Paretur e foliis hyoscyami pulveratis uti emplastrum belladonnae.(""It shall be prepared from powdered henbane leaves in the same way as belladonna plaster."")The language is technical, lexically rich, pithy, and formulaic. Apart from the drugs' names, which include many novel expressions from chemistry such askali hypermaganicum crystallisatum(""crystallized hypermanganic potash"") and the like, technical terms for pharmaceutical instruments like the brush (""penicillus"") or operations like straining (colare) or soaking (macerare) are omnipresent, not to speak of the ample and subtly nuanced vocabulary of plant description. Moreover, formulas likecaute servetur(""it shall be preserved with care"") orsit(""it shall be"", to introduce the desired properties of a substance) abound. The act of preparation is usually formulated in imperatives, passive subjunctives, or a combination of both.The volume is concluded by a list of chemical reagents, three tables indicating (A) doses of some drugs, which may be exceeded only if the doctor adds an exclamation mark on his recipe, (B) more and (C) less poisonous medications, whose storage requires special precautions, a list of specific weights of liquid drugs at 15°C, a table correlating alcoholic content and specific weight of spirits, and finally a German and a Latin index.The compendium was appreciated for its content and mode of presentation beyond the borders of Germany, as demonstrated by an English translation (1873), whose author sees it as one step on the way to a ""universal pharmacopœia"" (p. v). A second edition in 1882 still appeared in Latin, demonstrating the capacity of the old language to keep up with the rapid development of pharmaceutics under the influence of modern chemistry. From the third edition, thePharmacopoea Germanicabecame theDeutsches Arzneibuch, updated editions of which still keep appearing today.","Schmitz; Friedrich; Müller-Jahncke 1998–2005, 579–582","Pharmacopoea Austriaco-Provincialis emendata‎(← links)Anonymi‎(← links)Housselle, Karl‎(← links)","Housselle, Karl; Anonymi:Pharmacopoea Germanica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Pharmacopoea_Germanica(last revision: 12.10.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In fact, while Philolaus's system is not geocentric, it is not heliocentric either: the earth, the sun, the moon, the planets and the ""counter-earth"" all revolve around an invisible central fire. However, the fact thatPhilolausargued for a moving earth is used here as a hint that the book understands the true system of the world to be the heliocentric model. Here, it is a Copernican author who uses an ancient philosopher as a stand-in in the early modern debate about the structure of the universe. But the same titling strategy was employed also by the opposing side, as is evidenced byLibert Froidmont'sAnt-Aristarchusof 1631.The writer of the Copernican monograph hides behind the name ""Philolaus"", but in our digital copy, a handwritten note on the title page identifices the French astronomer Ismael Boulliau as the author. Only a few years after the publication of thePhilolaus, in 1645, Boulliau himself revealed his authorship in the preface to his follow-up monographAstronomia Philolaica(Philolaic Astronomy), which this time, he published under his own name (p. 7):Ante quinquennium libros IV de vero systemate mundi vulgaveram sub nomine Philolai [...] Philolai nomen libello imposueram, quoniam, quod olim dogma de terrae mobilitate Philolaus Pythagoricus docuerat, rationibus e geometria, optica et astronomia petitis confirmabam et demonstrabam.""Five years ago, I publishedFour Books on the True System of the Worldunder the name 'Philolaus' [...] I used the name 'Philolaus' for the little book because I confirmed and proved the doctrine of the movement of the earth, which the Pythagorean Philolaus once had taught, with arguments from geometry, optics and astronomy.""Boulliau calls thePhilolausalibellus, a little book, here. Indeed, as a octavo volume of 159 pages, it is rather small both in page number and page size compared to theAstronomia Philolaica, a folio of 232 pages. Still, thePhilolausis neatly printed, clearly structured and illustrated with many diagrams. The work is divided into four books: Book 1 presents the old system of the world (De systemate mundi antiquo, pp. 1–69), Book 2 the Tychonian system (De systemate mundi Tychonis Brahei, pp. 70–84). Book 3 explains some theorems and problems pertaining to the appearance of motions (Explicantur quaedam theoremata et problemata circa phaenomena motuum, pp. 85–100), Book 4, finally, presents the true system of the world, the Copernican system (De veri mundi systematis investigatione, pp. 101–159). The two inner books are much shorter than the two outer books, so that the structure seems to highlight the opposition between the ancient geocentric system vs. the true heliocentric system.Six years after thePhilolausappeared in print, Boulliau published the aforementioned, more elaborate heliocentric monographAstronomia Philolaica, whose title highlights the thematic connection to the earlier book and presents the new book as a followup publication on heliocentrism. However, in the few years between the publication of the two books, Boulliau had adopted ideas ofJohannes Kepler. In theAstronomia Philolaica, Boulliau became one of the first astronomers to accept that the planets move in elliptical orbs.",,"Boulliau, Ismael‎(← links)","Boulliau, Ismael:Philolaus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Philolaus(last revision: 06.02.2022).","Work brings nothing new but apart from promoting heliocentrism, it also provides the reader with a handy overview of the three major world systems of the early modern period.",,Yes,IT,

London 1726),"Newton's seminal workMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophyis considered to be the standard text for classical mechanics (Newtonian mechanics) as well as for the modern scientific method in general. Its title announces the paradigm shift in physics (or natural philosophy): Mathematics has become the language in which phenomena were to be described. For the first time, the same simple rules applied to and explained celestial and terrestrial phenomena.Although in many ways prepared byKepler,Descartes, Huygens,Barrow,Halleyor Hooke, this approach culminates in thePrincipia mathematica. Notions like force (vis), impulse, gravitation, or inertia were quantified and experienced a unified theory and explanation. Among the most prominent examples are Newton's axioms on the motion of bodies, his universal law of gravitation, and its application to planetary motion. 
Many thoughts had been expressed by the author in previous published and unpublished letters and works, includingDe motu corporum(1684) which served as a basis for the first and the third book of the Principia.Influences and genesisNewton was well informed about recent developments in mathematics and physics in the 1660s. He had studied Oughtred’sClavis mathematicae,Wallis’sArithmetica infinitorumandDescartes’sGéometrie in Frans van Schooten’sLatin editionand thus knew his new tool of Analytic geometry which was used to describe curves by mathematical equations. Barrow understood these curves as trajectories of moving bodies. Although Cartesian mathematics formed a fundament of a mathematical description of motion, and even though Descartes first found the law of inertia, Newton soon distanced himself from Descartes’s achievements and severely criticized him. Newton’s mathematical language is favoring Greek synthetic geometry – masking its novel character. Even the title is probably a criticism of Descartes’sPrincipia philosophiaewhich lacked mathematical models. In the 1670ies Newton had discussions with Hooke about the path of free-falling bodies on earth, who convinced him that the path must be elliptical. On the other hand, there were discussions in the Royal Society about the force the sun might exert on the planets and how Kepler’s laws might be linked with that force. By method of fluxions, Newton was able to mathematically grasp these phenomena in his tractDe motu. The print of the Principia was finally realized with the help ofEdmond Halley, who is addressed in the preface and contributed alaudatory poem.Structure and contentsThe book falls into four parts: A section of preliminaries and three books.Preliminaries: After a plain title page and a dedication page to the Royal Society and to King James II, Newton starts hisPraefatio ad lectoremwith a reference to Pappus, revealing his fondness for Greek-style mathematics. This is followed by Halley’s laudatory poem completing the paratexts. Then a section of definitions (of mass, momentum, force, etc.), a scholium on time and space and a rotating bucket, a section on axioms (Newton’s laws of motion), and some first deductions.The first book on the motion of bodies starts with a section of mathematical lemmas. In sections 2 and 3, Newton uses simple geometry and a limiting process to show Kepler’s laws if one assumes a single point force attracting the planets. Here, Newton employs force as a geometrical quantity. In the following parts, other conic sections are investigated as possible orbits in section 8, the general solution of finding an orbit from a given law of force is given, which means that Newton solved a differential equation. In section 11, Newton leaves the familiar terrain of a single immovable center of attraction – as, no such thing existed in nature – and formulates the law of universal gravitation, the mutual attraction of bodies. He finds that a system of two or more bodies orbits around their common center of gravity. As a consequence, Kepler’s laws cannot hold if one assumes positive mass to the planets. By this approach, Newton is able to explain many phenomena: The existence of satellites of planets, irregularities in the moon’s orbit, tides, and precession. In sections 12 and 13, the attraction of nonhomogeneous but spherically symmetrical shells and of non-spherical objects is studied by the means of Newton’s new mathematical toolbox.The second book is on the motion of bodies in resisting media and probably mathematically more interesting than physically, as it often sets up somewhat arbitrary mathematical conditions and investigates their consequences. As these conditions need not resemble something from the real physical world, this approach allows for exploring various models for resisting media. A section on pendula brings together inertia and weight to the property of the mass of a body. Other sections deal with fluid mechanics.In book three, Newton applies the theoretical results of the previous books to real-life problems. First, he states some rules on how to proceed in reasoning within natural philosophy. Then, several phenomena follow: The motions of Jupiter’s and Saturn’s satellites are calculated using Kepler’s area law and other similar problems. Again, the application of “universal gravitation” in the three-body problem concerning the moon’s orbit. The shape of the Earth (geoid), orbits of comets, and many other problems are tackled.
Each section is clearly structured, first briefly presenting the respective definition, axiom, etc., before in a clear and concise matter discussing the problems related to it. Images and charts accompany the text.ImpactThePrincipia mathematicais one of the most influential works of the scientific revolution. Many principles brought up by Newton are still in use and Newtonian mechanics serve as a good approximation of reality even today. Other principles which were missing or simply wrong were filled in and corrected in the 18th century by other scientists. And although several contemporaries were skeptical towards the notion of force which was supposed to operate at astronomic distances, the beauty and the accuracy of predictions of Newton's theory convinced them about his achievements. Due to Newton's antique Greek-style mathematics, the presentation of these results was soon outdated, however. Therefore, at the end of the 18th century, thePrincipiawas sparsely in use, as its results have widely been accepted, adopted and found their way into textbooks using the mathematical language of fluxions, or Leibniz's differentials.The digital copy of the first edition shows many manuscript notes, allegedly by the author himself.","Koyré; Cohen; Whitman 1972(modern edition)Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 10, 60–78Grattan-Guinness 2005, 59–87Hawking 2004Schüller 1999, 629-958","Newton, Isaac‎(← links)Astronomia nova‎(← links)Dissertatio de maris aestu‎(← links)De vita Isaaci Newtoni commentariolus‎(← links)Newton's epitaph‎(← links)Praelectiones ex physica theoretica‎(← links)In Newtoni opus hocce mathematico-physicum‎(← links)Introductio ad veram astronomiam seu lectiones astronomicae‎(← links)Tabulae astronomicae Ludovici magni iussu et munificentia exaratae‎(← links)Optice‎(← links)Epitome elementorum physico-mathematicorum‎(← links)Astronomiae physicae et geometricae elementa‎(← links)Anti-Newtonianismus‎(← links)Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis‎(← links)Aiton 1964‎(← links)Review of: Isaaci Nevvton Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica‎(← links)","Newton, Isaac:Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Philosophiae_naturalis_principia_mathematica(last revision: 12.09.2023).","2.ed. 1713, 3. ed. 1726","MK, FB",Yes,"JL, FB",

In about 24,000 hexameters, Stay provides a detailed overview of Newtonian physics and cosmology.The work was probably begun as early as the 1740s and certainly completed in 1755. The first two volumes were published in 1755 and 1760. Volume one is introduced by a letter from the author's brotherChristoph Stay, who initially declares how happy he is that Benedetto is finally ""relieved from the hardship of his long labour"" (diuturni laboris molestia te esse perfunctum). In volumes one and two, the text is accompanied by copious comments and additional remarks by the Jesuit physicistRoger Joseph Boscovich(1711–87). Because Boscovich's commentation of the third and last volume was much delayed and never entirely completed, this volume appeared only in 1792. In the same year, a one-volume edition of the whole poem containing the text only was published as well for the benefit ""of those who find it less annoying to run into some difficulty of understanding now and then than to interrupt the reading of the verses so often to consult the commentary, and of those so well-exercised in scientific reasoning that they do not need any explanations in order to understand everything, even the more difficult parts"" (p. IV).In the one-volume edition, which is taken as the point of reference of the present entry, the reader is first alerted to the circumstances of publication (Monitum, pp. III–VI). This is followed by the abovementioned letter by Christoph Stay (pp. VII–XXII), who affirms the possibility and desirability of explaining advanced science in verse, a very detailed table of contents (pp. XXIII–38 [the pagination changes to Arabic numerals at p. 33]) and the Jesuit and papal imprimaturs (p. 39). As an appendix, one finds Christoph Stay'sDe poesi didascalica dialogus.The poem itself can roughly be divided into four sections: Books 1–3 (vol. 1 of the original edition) expound the epistemological, kinematic, dynamical and geometric foundations of the subsequent remarks. Books 4–6 (vol. 2) discuss the mechanics of the solar system. The subject of books 7–9 is optics. Book 10 proposes an atomistic theory of matter, which includes Boscovich's theory of the mutual attraction and repulsion of corpuscles (vol. 3).In terms of style, Stay lets himself be guided by the model of Lucretius. His imitation of the Roman poet not only pertains to the latter's somewhat archaizing language and verse technique, but also to his exceptional stylistic range, which extends from the highly poetic to the drily technical. The whole poetic panoply of didactic epic is paraded in theModern Philosophy in Verse: inserted epyllia, invocations and prayers, similes and metaphores, recondite epithets, elaborate circumlocutions, emotional appeals to the reader and so on. On the other hand, complex physical issues are elaborated in painstaking detail and with relentless precision, including much versified mathematics. The phenomen of aberration, that is, the apparent 40 arcseconds change of location of the fixed stars over the year due to the motion of the earth and the finite speed of light, is described and interpreted as follows (7.711–17):Scilicet apparens altis hinc motus in astris / quadraginta aequat prope partes partium earum / senarum decies, in quas pars quaelibet una / dividitur, pars nempe, gradus quam continet unus / in decies senas itidem divisus; an ergo / mille quidem decies non partibus ocius ire / deprendas lumen quam terram?""For this apparent motion of the stars high above equals about forty parts of those ten times six parts, in which any part is diveded – I mean, a part contained in a degree divided in six times ten parts in like manner: So should you not understand that the light moves ten thousand times faster than the earth?""In passages such as this one Stay seems to consciously check out how far the limits of scientific poetry can be pushed.","Haskell 2003, 213–20","De poesi didascalica dialogus‎(← links)Montgolferii machina volans‎(← links)Stay, Benedetto‎(← links)Anti-Newtonianismus‎(← links)Optica‎(← links)","Stay, Benedetto:Philosophiae recentioris versibus traditae libri decem, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Philosophiae_recentioris_versibus_traditae_libri_decem(last revision: 12.05.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

The illustrated monograph of 229 pages is divided into two books. The first book,Phonosophia anacamptica, deals with the reflection of sound and the echo (pp. 1-170). In the course of his argument, Kircher discusses various aspects of acoustics, like the speed of sound, the formation of acoustic focal points in whispering galleries, the Ear of Dionysius in Syracuse, the Aeolian Harp and ear trumpets, among many other things. The second book,Phonosophia nova, is much shorter than the first (p. 171-229). It deals with consonance and dissonance, the therapeutic effects of music on body and soul (phonurgia iatrica) and various miraculous sounds. Kircher discusses examples from the bible as well as examples from his own time. For example, in the case of music as medicine, David playing the harp for King Saul is treated as well as the musical cure for tarantism (cf. alsoDe anatome, morsu et effectibus tarantulaein this database).In the preface to the reader, Kircher presents thePhonurgia novaon acoustics as the sister to hisArs magna lucis ac umbrae(1645) on optics (in the first chapter of the book, Kircher explains that sound behaves like light). However, there is also a concrete motivation for Kircher to publish this acoustical work. In England, Samuel Morland had published hisTuba stentoro-phonica, declaring that he invented the megaphone in 1670. Against Morland, Kircher contends to be the true inventor of the instrument and adduces a number of extracts from other authors to confirm his claim that he invented the megaphone twenty years before Morland.The titles in the book point to a predilection for Greek. For example, the rare adjectiveanacampticus(ἀνακαμπτικός, ""bent back"", ""returning"") is used to refer to the reflection of sound. But Kircher is creative with his Greek, creating new composite forms inphonurgia(φων-ουργία, ""making of sound"") andphonosophia(φωνο-σοφία, ""knowledge of sound""). Perhaps he coined the neologismPhonurgiato establish a connection to his earlierMusurgia universalis(1650) on sound and music, since the two books treat similar and sometimes the same topics (in contrast to φωνουργία, μουσουργία is attested in ancient Greek literature).ThePhonurgia novawas translated into German in 1684 and appeared under the titleNeue Hall- und Thonkunst.",,"Kircher, Athanasius‎(← links)","Kircher, Athanasius:Phonurgia nova, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Phonurgia_nova(last revision: 29.11.2021).",Frontispiece + poem explaining the frontispiece (cf.

Although all these texts were composed in the first half of the sixteenth century, they remained unpublished until 1611 and thus are a result of editorial selection and work.The wordphotismusin the title is Maurolico's neologism. Derived from the Greek φῶς (""light""), it puns on the collection's contents and might be translated as ""enlightening reflections"".In structuring hisopuscula, Maurolico follows the Euclidean tradition and divides the text into several theorems. The first treatise, thePhotismi de lumine et umbra, consists of two major parts (on the radiation of light and its reflection), which are in turn subdivided into several shorter paragraphs. While in theorems 1-7 Maurolico investigates the ways in which light emanates, and the radiation that objects receive in accordance with their position vis-a-vis and distance from to the source of light, in theorems 8-19 he focuses on the optical features of shadows. The three final theorems of part 1 (20-22) are devoted to thecamera obscura. The rest of the treatise (theorems 23-35) deals with reflection. All the theorems are quite short and accompanied by geometrical explanations and charts.The same structure also characerises the second treatise, theDiaphanorum partes, in which Maurolico provides a somewhat more detailed account of his theory of vision, with a particular focus on the optical features of the rainbow.

In its four parts (each of which is conveniently subdivided into chapters and paragraphs), this work discusses methodical questions and fundamental natural phenomena such as movement, temperature or vision, cosmology and astronomy, meteorology and geosciences, and the human body. An interested general readership was thus provided with a helpful overview of many aspects of early modern science, explained in layman's terms and with no mathematics to speak of. TheTraitébecame a huge success (seeClair 1978, 5–8 for a bibliography of the editions) and was translated into Latin twice (whereas a translation by the author himself, announced at the end of his preface, apparently came to nothing), namely under the titleTractatus physicusby Théophile Bonet (Geneva 1674, text only) and asPhysicaby Samuel Clarke (London 1697, with notes). Of these two renderings, it was the second one that proved more influential, becoming ""the outstanding scientific textbook in England (and America) in the first half of the eighteenth century"" (Sarton 1948, 144). Until 1718, three more editions with expanded notes appeared in London. (There also was an English translation by Samuel Clarke's brother, published in 1723.) The fourth and last edition, which forms the subject of the present entry, was in turn reprinted on the continent until 1740.The volume opens with a dedication by the translator to the bishop and scholar John Moore. In his preface, Clarke justifies his translation with the work's importance and the inferiority of Bonet's rendering, from which a few egregious mistranslations are quoted. His own translation mostly aims at clarity and an accurate reproduction of the original sense. Clarke also draws attention to his notes (see below). The long preface of the author identifies four problems which have hindered the progress of science so far, namely excessive reliance on authorities, too much metaphysics, separation of theoretical reasoning and experimentation and too little mathematics. (A fifth problem, lack of social recognition, is added afterwards.) Rohault also narrates the genesis of his work and outlines its structure and contents. After a full table of contents, the treatise itself starts.Clarke's translation is very readable indeed. He avoids overlong sentences and strikes a balance between linguistic classicism and the terminological needs of science. Technical terms are always printed in italics and defined at their first occurrence. Further guidance for the reader is provided by marginalia – already present in the French original – suchQuid sit Zodiacus(""What the zodiac is"", p. 267) alongside each paragraph. The most striking trait of Clarke's version, however, is the aforementioned annotation, which is highlighted already on the title page (where it is announced to be ""longer by half"" than in the earlier editions). The notes, which often take up the better part of the page, complement, criticize and contradict the body text and cumulatively replace the Cartesian worldview advocated by Rohault with a Newtonian one. An exemplary case can be found at p. 312, where Rohault speaks about the role ofvorticesin the solar system. Clarke dutifully translates Rohault's account but adds a note which runs over the next three pages. It beginsVortices materiae, in quibus planetae innatent, fictitios esse et naturae phaenomenis repugnare his argumentis constat(""That the vortexes of the matter, in which the planets are supposed to swim, are fictitious and contrary to the natural phenomena is clear from the following arguments""), lists four pertinent arguments and proceeds to present gravitation as a better alternative.The volume concludes with eight tables of illustrations (unfortunately not visible in the electronic version) and an extensiveindex rerum.","Sarton 1948, 141–145;Vanpaemel 1984","Rohault, Jacques‎(← links)Clarke, Samuel‎(← links)Sarton 1948‎(← links)Scientiae naturalis seu physicae compendium‎(← links)","Rohault, Jacques; Clarke, Samuel:Physica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Physica(last revision: 09.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

As explained in the preface, it is destined for the author's students who have their second year of philosophy at the University of Graz. Despite their shallow mathematical knowledge and the very restricted time available, Biwald wants to provide them with an overview of modern, that is,Newtonianand post-Newtonian, physics. This necessitates the abandonment of several difficult topics as well as of any proofs that would require higher mathematics. Still, the material treated on c. 500 pages seems more than ambitious for a one-year course in physics; presumably, Biwald could not resist the temptation to cram more into the book than could actually be taught and learned in class.ThePhysica generalisfalls into three parts, the first of which deals with elementary properties of bodies and with kinematics. Part II returns to bodies and their characteristics, but covers the field more philosophically and in greater detail, concluding with a number of questions related to gravity. Part III is dedicated to astronomy. The parts are subdivided in numberedsectiones,articuli,propositionesand paragraphs, which may in turn be split into body text andscholia, that is, additional remarks in smaller font. Besides this articulation in precisely defined units, marginalia provide further guidance for the students. The many diagrams referenced in the text are found on 14 tables at the end.The work offers more and less than what is understood by physics today. On the one hand, it also discusses other scientific disciplines such as astronomy (see above) and chemistry (pp. 205–220). Moreover, there is a good deal of natural philosophical speculation. (In the respective passages, thePhysica generalisreads a bit like a scholastic treatise, an impression reinforced by the occasional use of scholastic language. Answers to objections, for instance, can be introduced by formulas such asC(oncedo) M(aiorem) N(ego) m(inorem), ""I concede the major premise but deny the minor"", p. 158). Finally, Biwald also provides historical and doxographical overviews of the questions discussed by him. On the other hand, such calculations as are adhibited are elementary at best. In general, geometry is preferred to arithmetics and algebra. In large parts of the book, mathematics is completely left aside.Biwald freely draws on earlier and contemporary works of physics. The author quoted most often is his fellow JesuitRuđer Josip Bošković. Experiments, for which he lacks time and money, are reported from a recent work by the Dutch natural scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek. However, when Biwald emphatically states that his book contains nothing original by himself (third page of the preface), this is too modest: In part II, section 1 he defends his personal conviction that bodies possess a certainvis motrix, a force of motion, of their own.One year later, in 1768, Biwald complemented thePhysica universalisby aPhysica particularison more specific phenomena such as fire or electricity.

In this text, Alsted combines two intellectual trends of significant importance at the time. On the one hand, he aims at uniting contemporary scientific findings and theories with Christian theological teaching. Written within the Calvinist context, thePhysica harmonicareflects a quest for a philosophised interpretation of the Creation supplemented (but not dominated) by scientific data. On the other hand, the treatise's author clearly remains loyal to theprisca theologiadoctrine, which dates back to fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century scholars responsible for the incorporation of occult sources (Kabbalah, Hermetism, Neoplatonism and others) within a standard natural philosophical and theological framework. This explains a significant number of references to Kabbalistic sources with which Alsted, following Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and other leading Christian Kabbalists of the Renaissance, reconstructed the Creation of the universe according to Jewish teaching.The main body of the treatise is preceded by a short, one-page poem, in which Alsted praises the study of natural philosophy in general and natural philosophers in particular, and a brief preface. In the latter, Alsted claims that the beauty and harmony of the universal creation is to be explained through the ancient knowledge about nature that derives from theprisci theologi, primarily from Moses and Jewish rabbis, and contemporary natural philosophy. He, therefore, structures his book accordingly, thus reproducing what he considers the hierarchy of knowledge: while the two first books focus on Mosaic physics and Rabbinic and Kabbalistic interpretations of the natural order intended by God through Genesis, the two remaining books deal with less occult topics, such the Peripatetic tradition andphysica chemicaconcerned with the world of four basic elements.
To conclude his work, Alsted adds the final, albeit quite brief, chapter onphysica poetica, in which he seeks to demonstrate that poets, natural philosophers and theologians are unanimous in describing the harmony of the universe.",Hotson 2000,"Alsted, Johann Heinrich‎(← links)","Alsted, Johann Heinrich:Physica harmonica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Physica_harmonica(last revision: 22.11.2021).","For classification as compendium, see p. 270, where the work is expressedly called thus.",OA,Yes,OA,

The style of his commentary alternates between a more technical and a lofty-exuberant tone.The first volume opens with a frontispiece, title page, a portrait of the author and a portrait of the publisher, a preface, in which the author defends bringing together the truth of science and the truth of scripture, and an impressive catalogue of authors (not all of which Scheuchzer had read, as he admits in the preface), a catalogue of artists working on the engravings, and a French laudatory epigram. The fourth volume offers five indexes to the whole work, three indexes on cited authors, bible passages and Hebrew or Greek words, a substantial index rerum and an index of illustrations.The Latin and German editions were almost immediately followed by aFrench edition, which was printed Amsterdam (8 vols., 1732–1737). ADutch edition(12 vols.) was printed at end of the century (1787–1792). ThePhysica sacrathus became a model for other physicotheological works (cf.Roling 2017). However, it could also be adapted in a very different way: stripped of Scheuchzer's commentary and the scientific engravings, it became apicture bible(around 1760).",Müsch 2000Felfe 2003Roling 2017,"De iis, quae scripta sunt physice in Libris Sacris‎(← links)Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob‎(← links)Triumphus Bibliorum sacrorum‎(← links)Assertio pro libello suo Germanico‎(← links)","Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob:Physica sacra, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Physica_sacra(last revision: 18.07.2022).",,MK,Yes,IT,

(The formPhysilogicesin the title is probably just a typo.)The letter of dedication is addressed to Lambertus Gruterus, bishop of Wiener Neustadt (Austria) and apparently a former pupil of the author. Dodoens explains that the work has been written some 30 years ago, but was left in manuscript at the time. He recently found it among his papers and decided to publish it. There is nothing new in it in terms of content. Rather, it is the mode of presentation that is remarkable and useful. The lengthy remarks on physiology of Galen and his modern followers have been distilled into a series of handy tables which can prepare students for the perusal of Galen himself on the one hand and serve as an aide-mémoire for what they have already learned on the other.The work is divided into nine chapters (intitled themselvesTabula Ietc. in a slightly misleading way, see below). They are devoted to medicine at large (I), physiology (II), the parts of the human body (III), an alternative classification of the solid parts (IV), bodily liquids (V), superfluous liquids (VI), bodily spirits (VII), the abilities and activities of the body (VIII) and its necessary attributes (e.g., a certain temperament, IX).The tables presented in these chapters are so-called Ramist tables, which became popular in early modern times through the textbooks written by Pierre de la Ramée (1515–1572), even if they were not invented by him (Maclean 2002, 61–63). The hallmark of this kind of tables is their use of brackets in order to visualize the conceptual subdivision of certain notions. For example, drugs are divided by Dodoens into simple and composite, simple drugs into herbal, animal and mineral drugs, herbal drugs into flowers, fruits (including seeds), leaves, barks, roots and saps (p. 346). Many of Dodoens' tables are very short, but the most extensive ones stretch over up to four pages, which must have made their use  quite troublesome. However, the tables take up only one half or so of the whole account. The rest is running text interspersed with simple lists.In accordance with his aim to enable students to read Galen for themselves, Dodoens often gives Greek terms in addition to their Latin translations or even without translation, providing precise definitions instead. The kind of joint called γίγγλιμος, for instance, is explained by the phrasequando ossa se invicem ingredientia iunguntur, ita ut unius ossis gibba alterius sinus subintret et rursus unius cavum alterius gibbum(""when bones are joined in such a way that they are inserted into each other: one bone's prominence enters the other's cavity and the other's prominent part enters the first one's cavity"", p. 356).",,"Dodoens, Rembert‎(← links)Medicinae utriusque, Galenicae et Hermeticae, anatome philosophica‎(← links)","Dodoens, Rembert:Physilogices medicinae partis tabulae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Physilogices_medicinae_partis_tabulae(last revision: 09.08.2021).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

(For a later item, see Nicolaus Joseph von Jacquin'sOxalis. Monographia.) In this case, Morison deals with “plants with an umbrella”, that is basically the modern family of Apiaceae. The work is dedicated to James Butler, Duke of Ormond, and Chancellor of Oxford University. Apart from the dedicatory letter, the work contains two prefaces. The first preface addresses Morison’s colleagues at Oxford University, the second and longer one the reader. In both prefaces, Morison praises his new method in the systematics of plants that he explains in the preface to the reader. While many earlier works have, for example, been ordered according to medical properties, blooming period, or habitat, his taxonomy and thus also the order of his book is based on relationship of the species, most notably on the shape of the seeds. Morison states that his study on umbelliferous plants is just a first example and that his method should also be used in other groups of plant species. Interestingly, he also claims that his new order has also been applied in the botanical garden so that cognate plants are now growing near each other.Morision has ordered “umbellifera”strictu sensuinto ninecapita. Eachcaputis organised in the same way: There is a heading that contains the main characteristics of this group followed by a bracket chart with the ‘genera’ and ‘species’ belonging to it. These are discussed in more detail on the following pages. Each ‘species’ is shortly described (up to one page). The description of the physiognomy is followed by remarks on habitat and time, names (with references to literature), and medical properties.
After the “umbelliferae”strictu sensu, Morison also discusses similar looking plants that are not really belonging to the same group (umbrellae improprie dictae) such as valerians (modern family Caprifoliaceae) or filipendula (modern family Rosaceae) (p. 50-61). He also describes plants that he newly included into the “umbelliferae” group (p. 62–70). This is followed by some overviews on other groups that can be distinguished within the “umbelliferae”, which are, however, not taxonomical, such as species with yellow or reddish blossom, species whose roots, seeds, or blossoms are used in the kitchen, etc. (p. 70–72).
Another substantial part is a quite fierce critical assessment of Morison's predecessors in systematics, especiallyCaspar Bauhin, titled on the “hallucinations of Caspar Bauhin and other authors"" (Hallucinationes Caspari Bauhini aliorumque authorum; p. 73–91). Ordered according to his own system, Morison quotes ancient sources mentioning certain plants. Printed in smaller font and in two columns, Morison then quotes Bauhin’s (and at times other’s) comments and attempts of identification of the plant in question together with his own assessment and criticism.
Apart from a few errata (p. 91), one finds figures containing his system of plants, detailed and accurate engravings of seeds, inflorescences, shapes of leaves, etc. at the end of the book.
As it is to be expected, Morison’s Latin style in the plant descriptions is technical, but quite elevated in the prefaces.","Pavord 2005, 387","Oxalis.

Instead, an overview of key aspects of Ptolemaic cosmology (the earth as the centre of the Universe, its comparative minuteness, its roundness, heavy things falling towards its centre etc.) is given on 48 octavo pages. Only part of the material will have been treated in the disputation. The work is bare of any paratexts.As in many scientific books of the era, the structure of the text (sketched in the appendix below) is to some extent inspired by Euclid'sElements, although not all types of chapters and subsections are actually derived from this model.

The bulk of the text consists of proofs oftheoremataandlemmataand solutions ofproblemata.Train of thought and style show some scholastic features, in particular a certain predilection for (quasi-)syllogistic reasoning (e.g. p. 25: ""In a lunar eclipse, the shadow of the terraquean globe appears as round. But a shadow imitates the body which projects it. Therefore, the earth is globular."") More prominent is the Euclidean language of geometrical proof. Many sections start with a jussive conjunctive likeSint circuli …(""Let there be the circles …"", p. 23) and end with some variation ofQuod erat demonstrandum(ὅπερ ἔδει δεῖξαι). Capitals are used to indicate points and geometrical objects. Astronomical symbols are common as well. The work features a number of illustrations: A modest frontispiece shows an armillary sphere.

He used the speech to confront growing criticism over his already strong physico-theological position.The short speech of only sixteen printed pages opens with a call to listeners to set aside their assumptions that mathematics and theology are unrelated fields (p. 2). Scheuchzer then begins with a strong but straightforward statement of his belief that God gave the world its masses, weights, measurements and figures at its creation. Having thus defended the divinity of mathematics’ essential concerns, he next demonstrates the purity of the field, which does not work on the basis of interpretation or partisan analysis, but rather on the basis of ‘hard facts’ that no-one can doubt (p. 6). He next quotes at length from a speech (Oratio praefatoria) of English mathematicianIsaac Barrow(pp. 7–8), originallyOratio praefatoria, pp. xxxiv–xxxvi. In this excerpt Newton’s teacher similarly defends the fundamental place of mathematics in philosophy (and thereby in theology). After repeating his call for patience and attentiveness among his (apparently critical) audience, Scheuchzer next moves into a more detailed overview of the place of mathematics in answering key theological questions. Here he works sub-field by sub-field and covers chronology (pp. 9–11), astronomy (p. 10), geography (pp. 11–12), arithmetics, geometry (p. 12), architecture (both naval and civil), military tactics (p. 13) and finally astrology (p. 13). The speech draws to a close with a  list of famous mathematicians whose work revealed great ‘truth’ (p. 14) before Scheuchzer gives over to two further long quotes, the first in French from theActsof the Royal Society and the second again from Barrow in Latin (pp. 14–15), the original source beingOratio praefatoria, pp. xxxi–xxxii.After the end of the speech itself, the volume next contains two pages of an annotated further reading list, mentioning first works from Eusebius and Heinrich Bullinger. There next follows a poem before a list of works printed by Scheuchzer’s brothers and a list of his own publications.Scheuchzer sent two manuscript copies of the text to Bernoulli in Basel. According to the two men’s epistolary exchange (cf.Korrespondenz zwischen Bernoulli und Scheuchzer UB), the first copy went missing for a time in the post. It was, however, later found. One of these two manuscripts of the speech survives in the library at Basel University (sig. UB Basel Ms L I a 721, fo. 122-138).

As the author explains in the preface, he was constrained to compose the work because of a curriculum change, which affected lectures at the university. Interestingly from a philological perspective, Zallinger states that he had not been able to simply recommend another textbook to his students, because for the new physical knowledge of the time, there was no Latin textbook to be found. And as the teaching language at Innsbruck at the time was still Latin, the use of a German work was not expedient. The work was, because of this special situation, also composed in quite a hurry, Zallinger adds. The only other paratext is a quotation from Isaac Newton'sPrincipia mathematica.The work presents the most important teaching materials on physics in a succinct and technical manner, in 892 numbered paragraphs - the characteristics of bodies; mechanics; liquids; pneumatics; optics; thermodynamics; electricity and magnetism as well as ""physical geography"", i.e. meteorology. It begins with an introduction into physics, which also includes a very brief history, in which famous scholars of the last centuries are mentioned, e.g. Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle, Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, René Descartes etc. At the end of his explanations, Zallinger put a historical reflection on the progress of physics, again presenting important scholars and their contributions to the field, as well as a list and discussion of crucial recent controversies.","Korenjak; Schaffenrath; Subaric; Töchterle 2012, p. 1031.","Zallinger zum Thurn, Franz Seraphin von‎(← links)","Zallinger zum Thurn, Franz Seraphin von:Praelectiones ex physica theoretica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Praelectiones_ex_physica_theoretica(last revision: 21.04.2021).",,,Yes,JL,

A majuscule inscription on the oval frame of the portrait informs the reader about the portrayed author’s name, title, place and date of birth.The portrait, dated as of 1644, is accompanied by an epigram of six Latin hexameters by Constantijn Huygens the younger, son of the homonymous father:Primus inaccessum qui per tot saecula verumeruit e taetris longae caliginis umbris,mysta sagax, Natura, tuus, sic cernitur orbiCartesius.

The dutiful right hand of the artist wanted to connect the sacred face in the image with lasting fame, so that all ages see him, who no age will be silent about.""In a take on theprimus inventor-motif, the young poet depicts the portrayed as the first to bring the truth to light which had been inaccessible for centuries. In the third line, the poem is revealed to be addressed to Lady Nature, presenting to her the portrait of her wise priest of mysteries, whose name,Cartesius, is artfully given only at the very end of the sentence, creating suspension and highlighting Descartes' importance. In the second half of the epigram, the poet reflects on the intended function of the portrait: The portrayer – i.e. van Schooten, who is praised in passing as dutiful (pius) towards his modell Descartes – wanted to connect the image to Descartes’ lasting fame, so that he can be seen by all centuries. The poem praises the philosopher and scientist Descartes by drawing on the language of religion and mysteries, as the detection of unknown truths in the darkness, the depiction of Descartes as the mystical priest of Nature, and the description of Descartes' face as “sacred” suggest.Aletterto Constantijn Huygens by his younger brotherChristiaanfrom March, 29th, 1650 (shortly after Descartes’ death) shows that Constantijn Huygens wrote his poem for the portrait of Descartes on Schooten’s request. The letter offers an interesting glimpse into the process of collaboration and reworking in the process of publication: Christiaan Huygens mentions that van Schooten wrote a letter to their fatherConstantijn, which contained some corrections to Huygen’s epigram by people van Schooten consulted on the matter.

"Curtz, Albert von",Problema Austriacum super data recta linea quattuor-decangulum aequiangulum et aequilaterum constituere,,1653,Munich,Straub,17th century,Monograph,Mathematics,Problema Austriacum(ÖNB Digital),862098,"This short monograph describing the construction of a regular heptagon and a regular 14-gon with the help of a parabola and a hyperbola was published on the occasion of the coronation of Ferdinand IV as the 14th Habsburg ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. The text constitutes an interesting example of the instrumentalization of pure mathematics for panegyrical aims.The frontispiece shows Ferdinand IV taking his place among his 13 predecessors and features highly panegyrical imagery: The designated king is escorted by the prince-electors, a show of unity which to some degree appears to be an overstatement compared to his real election. Ferdinand is also shown as the defender of the throne against Turkish invaders. At the same time, the frontispiece already highlights the geometrical content of the monograph by depicting several putti handling geometrical tools such as rulers and compasses.After the title page and an ellogium in honour of Ferdinand IV, first comes a preliminary note to the ""mathematical reader"" (pp. 2-6), the first part of which states the motives for the construction. One motive is the lack of any previous successful attempt at the construction. This also serves as a justification for the treatise. Another motive is the praise of Ferdinand IV, which is done by mirroring his coronation as the 14th king through the construction of a 14-gon. This section is interspersed with different apologetic topoi. The second part is a sometimes cryptical description of the methods by which Curtz succeeded in his construction of the 14-gon and of some other results that can be obtained by applying the same methods. Not all of these statements are correct.Pp. 6–9 contain the description of the construction and the proof of two preliminary lemmata, supported by several diagrams, the pages of which are not numbered. This description ends with a restatement of what remains be shown and thereby anticipates the following proof (pp. 10–12). The correctness of the heptagon is shown first, then that of the 14-gon, using results from the first part. The proof is correct.On pp. 12–15, Curtz first adds some figures to his construction, which he uses to deduce certain relations of length and area. He goes on to use these to deduce an algebraic condition of the 14-gon’s constructability, reducing the problem to solving the equation x^3+4x^2-4x=8. The impossibility of this was not known until the 18th century. Afterwards, the approximation of one root of this equation is calculated by a numerical procedure, which can originally be attributed to Arabian mathematicians. Curtz also specifies the error in his calculation. To conclude this part, Curtz calculates all diagonal lines between the vertices of his 14-gon.Finally, Curtz forcibly links his results to the task he set for himself in the beginning by observing that the circumference of a regular 14-gon, assuming that its side has length 1, is of length 14. At the end of the book we have public vows for Ferdinand's wellbeing, an illustration showing an eagle bearing the 14-gon and some bibliographical indications (place, year, printer).Throughout the mathematical sections, Curtz indicates which sources he has used (although his indications are  sometimes imprecise). These are theElementsof Euclid, theConicsof Apollonius of Perge and theConicsof Claude Mydorge, a French contemporary of Curtz. He seems to assume that Euclid is famous enough to go without a reference by name. Similarly, the name Apollonius is only mentioned in the preliminary note, his work is just referenced by the abbreviationCon. Mydorge is abbreviated byCon. Cl. Mid. The references are always given by the number of a propositon followed by the book in which it occurs, such that2, I.would refer to proposition 2 in Book 1 of theElements. Sometimes, the references are specified by the addition ofcoroll.orschol., both of which refer to Neolatin text editions of said works.The most important source is certainly Euclid, who is quoted regularly. The works on conics are less important. Apollonius in particular seems to be only referenced in order to lend Curtz' arguments more weight. Claude Mydorge on the other hand seems to have had a more direct impact on Curtz, which is not visible from the references. Instead the usage of certain technical terms (most importantlyparameter), which were first introduced by Mydorge, make this dependence clear.",Brüser 2019,"Curtz, Albert von‎(← links)Problema Austriacum super data recta linea quatuor-decangulum aequiangulum et aequilaterum constituere(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Curtz, Albert von:Problema Austriacum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Problema_Austriacum(last revision: 13.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,"MK, JL",

It is also an interesting work in itself because of its high intellectual standard and wide range of contents. Part textbook (it is based on lectures given by the author, and there are references to his ""hearers"" and similar indications:Morrow 1970, xxiv–xxv), part philosophical and scientific treatise in its own right (as at different places it is often too advanced for beginners), Proclus's commentary is selective in explaining Euclid's single theorems but generous in inserting reflections regarding the nature of mathematics in general, its relation to philosophy, mathematical terminology, Euclid's way of thinking and writing and so on (Morrow 1970, xxiv–xliii). Proclus appears very informed on various discussions and objections on certain passages by various ancient mathematicians. He does not ignore but responds to them, often by the help of other authors who had already clarified these questions. Proclus's is humble enough not to sell these answers as his own but gives credit to the respective authors. Insofar as it heavily draws on Euclid's predecessors, followers and earlier commentators, it also constitutes an invaluable source for the history of Greek mathematics from its origins to the 5th century AD.First edited in the original Greek from a single, bad manuscript at Basel in 1533 by Simon Grynaeus, Proclus's commentary got its first translation by the precocious humanist and mathematician Francesco Barozzi in 1560, who lectured on it in Padua (Grendler 2001, 417). Barozzi divides the text into four books devoted to mathematics in general, geometry and the definitions from which Euclid's first book starts, the discussion of triangles and of quadrilaterals respectively; there is manuscript evidence for this division, but it probably does not go back to Proclus himself (Friedlein 1873, VII–VIII). He equips the text with marginalia, which do not only provide some general orientation, but also, despite their compression, elucidate the meaning of certain passages. He also adds the diagrams from the manuscript tradition. Finally, he fills a number of lacunae with expositions of his own.Barozzi is exceptional as a translator and as a textual critic. He clearly sets out his principles of translation and explains how he is going to treat various aspects from terminology to syntax in his preface to the reader. (This is accompanied by scathing remarks about the liberties taken and the errors committed by other translators of his day, which are exaggerated but nonetheless contain more than a grain of truth.) The translation itself is so precise that it figures as an important textual witness in the apparatus of the leading (and only) modern edition of the Greek text (Friedlein 1873). Its value for the constitutio textus is also due to the fact that Barozzi adduces no less than five manuscripts in addition to the Basel edition (in which, as he remarks in the preface, the text isdilaniatum magis quam editum, ""rather mangled than edited""). He diligently names the manuscripts in his letter of dedication to the humanist, scientist, architect and patriarch of Aquileia, Daniele Barbaro, and draws attention to variants in the tradition by marginalia marked with a dagger (†).The edition is equipped with a generous paratextual apparatus. The title page is followed by a portrait of Barozzi, seven short poems of praise (six in Latin, one in Greek) for Proclus and Barozzi by a certain Vincenzo Cardini, the letter of dedication, the preface to the reader, a list of errata and a catalogue of gods, famous men, authors and books mentioned or quoted in the commentary. An index rerum at the end with over 1000 entries makes the book easy to consult.","Friedlein 1873, esp.

This discussion had its origin in antiquity, particularly the Aristotelian conviction that because of its abstraction, mathematics had no part in natural philosophy, which was concerned solely with real matters discernible by the senses. Medieval scholars considered Aristotelian logic as the standard of scientific reasoning. The highest form was achieved in the so-calleddemonstrationes potissimae: proofs which gave the reasons and the effect at the same time. Analyzing proofs fromEuclid,Allessandro Piccolominifamously denied in hisCommentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarumthat mathematics was satisfying this request.Relying mainly onProclusand the Venetian mathematicianFrancesco Barozzi'scommented edition of this ancient work, Clavius argues that the mathematical disciplines do indeed belong to the realm of science. His most important argument in this dispute is geometry, particularly Euclid's demonstrations: while other natural philosophical theories make room for ample interpretation and different views, which can easily be seen looking at Aristotle's works themselves, Euclid's geometry exhibits a considerably higher degree of certainty, which leaves no room for discussion. This makes geometry the most certain part of natural philosophy and as the whole cosmos works according to geometrical rules, all other mathematical disciplines exhibit a high degree of certainty, as well.
Clavius first discusses the namemathematicae disciplinae, goes on to present the division of the disciplines, mentions their first representatives, e.g. the Pre-Socratics, Pythagoras, but also the Arabs, before discussing the role of mathematics as mentioned above. He ends with a division of three types ofprincipiain the mathematical disciplines: definitions, postulates, and axioms. This introduction is immediately followed by hisedition and commentary of Euclid.In his reasoning, Clavius not only mentions Aristotle,Euclid,Proclus, andBarozzi, but also Plato, as well as theological writers such as the church fathers Augustine and Jerome, as he is convinced that mathematics is also a way to understand Scripture.Clavius's interpretation of geometry as the basis of all mathematical disciplines, as well as his conviction that mathematics is able to solve also metaphysical questions, proved influential especially in Jesuit circles over the following decades (cf.Udías 2015, pp. 2–22).Together with Euclid'sElementsthe work was frequently reprinted. In Clavius's five-volumeOpera mathematica, it can be found under the longer titleChristophori Clavii Bambergensis e Societate Iesu in disciplinas mathematicas prolegomena.","Udías 2015, 12-13.","Commentarium de certitudine mathematicarum disciplinarum‎(← links)Clavius, Christoph‎(← links)Euclidis elementorum libri XV‎(← links)In disciplinas mathematicas prolegomena(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Clavius, Christoph:Prolegomena, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Prolegomena(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,FB,Yes,"JL, FB",

I], fol. α†4r–C†4r",1562,Basel,Froben,16th century,"Biography, Bibliography",Medicine,Prolegomena in Galenum(e-rara.ch),830009,"Following ancient precedent, early modern editions were sometimes introduced by a biography of the edited author. When Gessner undertook the task to prepare for Froben the third Latin edition of Galen'sOpera omnia(Basel 1561–62), he also composed an introduction to it. At that time, he already had won international fame as author of the monumentalBibliotheca universalis(1545). In general, biographies were often combined with bibliographies at the time. It therefore comes as no surprise that Gessner'sProlegomenabecame a massive Galenic biobibliography comprising 60 folio pages in small and dense print. They are preceded by a short, precise summary (fol. α†4r), which is rendered here because it gives a good overview of their contents.""The first part contains an extensive description of Galen's life, setting out his name, homeland, lifetime, parents, elementary education (including the respective teachers), his study of medicine (including the respective teachers), his meticulousness regarding proof and truth, his friends and travels. After this, some accounts about his predictions and cures are given. Next, mention is made of his health, ailments and death, and finally of his character, virtues and sense of duty. At long last, there is a very elaborate exposition of his excellence in all kinds of learning, of the light shed by him on medicine, the nature of his books in general, their style and way of reasoning and the usefulness of their perusal for different other disciplines. However, this first part of my introduction not only contains Galen's life and praise of him, but also a great deal regarding the praise of medicine (and of philosophy at large) and its rationale, as well as an example, nay, the very idea of a perfect physician. — Between the first and second parts, there are four insertions: I. On the Greek editions of Galen's works, II. On the Latin editions of the same, III. On some lost books by Galen and which books may be taken as substitutes for them, IV. On some writers of our time who have treated some general topics pertaining to Galen's books. — Part two is catalogue or list of Galen's books in the order in which they have been printed in this edition and already earlier, following more or less the opinion of Giovanni Battista Montano [Paduan physician, 1489–1551, seeFortuna 2012, 402–404]. To each book I have added which and how many translators (nearly all of them from our age up to the present day) have done them into Latin, so far as I have been able to track them down. In many cases, I also have presented the contents or anything else worth knowing about the single items; I also have recorded the people who have in any way, by commentaries, annotations, notes, summaries or otherwise, shed light on Galen's books. — Part three lists, in the form of an alphabetical catalogue, the writers themselves who have in any way whatsoever, by translations, commentaries, annotations etc., shed light on Galen's books, so that it becomes clear at one glance, which and how many books of Galen each of them has translated or what else he has accomplished in this field. In most cases, I have also added the homeland, era and certain other things to every single writer.""The first part, the biography proper, is itself introduced by a short bibliography of earlier biographies of Galen. It is written in fluent, readable periods and panegyrical style. Marginalia keep the reader oriented. Quotations from Galen's original Greek not only point to the fact that Gessner's account is mainly based on theCorpus Galenicumitself, but also underline Gessner's learning and reliability. Galen is portrayed as the consummate physician par excellence, who is beyond all blame. This is particularly evident in cases where he indeed could be blamed or really was. For instance, his exuberant self-praise is justified as always necessary and grounded in fact (fol. β†2v). Although Galen was a pagan, Gessner insists that he was at least a monotheist (fol. β†2v–β†3v). A lengthy demonstration that the perusal of Galen's writings is not only necessary for physicians, but also useful for representatives of all other scientific disciplines (fol. γ†2r–γ†3v) seems to aim at maximising the present edition's potential readership. The biography is sealed by a Greek epigram on Galen from theAnthologia Palatina.

Thus, it is evident from the outset that the author takes liberties with the traditionalquadrivium, which consists of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The content is rather elementary and aims for applications in surveying and astronomy. The books on arithmetic contain reckoning with integers, common and sexagesimal fractions, and the rule of three; the books on geometry introduce basic geometrical notions and objects, chord and sine of an angle, and a table of sines which is then used in neatly illustrated surveying problems of various kinds; the books of cosmography teach basic astronomical notions, the content of theastronomia sphaericaand several useful tables; the last part is on the construction of various sundials and instructions on how to use the quadrant for astronomical problems.Although some peculiarities point to a complicated printing process, like separate title pages for the four parts with differing publication years, the text leaves no doubt that Finé conceived hisProtomathesisas one work (cf.Pantin 2010, 289).A prestige publication in folio format, theProtomathesisis adorned with frontispieces, initials, and other decorative woodcut elements. The paratext includes a handful of Neo-Latin poems, among them aiambic poemby the printerGérard Morrhy. The typographical design provides a clear structure, marginalia, and paragraph numbers run alongside the text of the single chapters; a threefold index (anindex universalis, anindex particularis, and anindex tabularum) makes it easy for readers to orient themselves within the volume. The most important innovation lays in the rich illustration with woodcut diagrams (comprising some 280 within the whole work), which led to Paris developing into a centre for printing mathematical books in the mid-16th century (cf.Pantin 2010).In the 16th century, all four parts of theProtomathesiswere reprinted as separate works, sometimes in abridged versions (almost all of the editions were published in Paris, cf. the list inPantin 2010, 309). The parts oncosmographyandgeometryappeared in French translation in 1552 and 1570 respectively. The entireProtomathesiswas translated intoItalianin 1587.","Pantin 2010Enenkel 2015, 426–428Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 15, 153–157.","Finé, Oronce‎(← links)In operis commendationem epigramma‎(← links)","Finé, Oronce:Protomathesis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Protomathesis(last revision: 01.02.2022).","Although called a textbook without ado by Pantin, the work probably never was used in class.

They proved more and more useless in the prediction of important celestial phenomena such as conjunctions or eclipses. To solve the resulting problems, the Thuringian master of arts and leading mathematical astronomer Erasmus Reinhold published a new work of tables, which he called ""Prussian Tables"". In imitation of theTabulae Alfonsinae, although more obliquely, this title honoured the man who had financed the print, Albert, Duke of Prussia. The work proved to be a success. Although it did not replace theAlfonsine Tablesimmediately and completely, it went through three editions and one reprint until 1585 and became the standard work of its kind until the appearance of Kepler'sTabulae Rudolphinaein 1627. It also did much to establish the fame of Copernicus, whose data fromDe revolutionibus orbium coelestiumReinhold used and whom he praised in his preface (Gingerich 1973). Finally, although Reinhold was a Lutheran, his work provided the basis of the calendar reform initiated by Pope Gregory XIII.The ""Prussian Tables"" are a long (nearly 500 folio pages) and complex book comprising more than just tables. They fall into two separately paginated main parts. The first part, titledPraecepta(""Instructions""), which comprises some 130 pages divided into 73 chapters, is a handbook of astronomical mathematics which provides the technical expertise required for handling the second part. This second part presents 52 tables (canones) with numerical data concerning many different aspects of astronomy. All in all, several tens of thousands of figures are tabulated – the result of six years of calculations, as remarked in the preface.Although Reinhold on the first page of his dedication to Duke Albert expressly states that his book is not written fortirones, thePraeceptaare noteworthy for their clear style and careful explanations. Right at the outset, for instance, Reinhold briefly, but precisely elucidates the difference between astronomy and astrology (fol. 1v). Throughout this part, he is keen to anticipate and meet the needs of this readers, for example by explaining the necessary technical terminology:Initio rursum de eruditis appellationibus, quae apud Ptolemaeum extant, breviter admonere volo studiosum(""At the beginning, I want to remind the scholar briefly of the learned designations that are to be found in Ptolemy"", fol. 46v). The tables display a clear layout and feature helpful additions such as a proper title page for each of them, captions, and short explanations.The introductory paratexts fit an opus magnum such as the present one. They comprise an imperial privilege for the author, a letter of dedication to Duke Albert, two Greek praise elegies byJoachim Camerariusand Michael Neander, and a preface in which Reinhold proudly expresses his belief that the core of his book will be usefulad totam mundi durationem(""as long as the world will exist""). In addition, both parts are preceded by their own table of contents. At the end, one finds a list of errata, something of particular importance in a book whose worth almost completely depends on the accuracy of its figures.Reinhold followed the exact arrangements of circles and epicycles of Copernicus'sDe revolutionibus, but he simply ignored the cosmological implications of Copernicus's heliocentric model, using it only as a useful working hypothesis producing very accurate data. This view was adopted by many astronomers in the following 50 to 100 years. On the one hand, he thus served the Copernican astronomy to be acknowledged for its superiority in predicting celestial phenomena; on the other hand, he was one of the first to ignore the physical reality of heliocentrism and promoting Copernicanism only as a handy tool.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 11, 365–366.Gingerich 1973","Liber de epochis‎(← links)Reinhold, Erasmus‎(← links)Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetuae‎(← links)Triangulorum geometria‎(← links)Mysterium cosmographicum‎(← links)De emendatione temporum‎(← links)","Reinhold, Erasmus:Prutenicae tabulae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Prutenicae_tabulae(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,"MK, FB",

He intended to dedicate it to Pope Nicholas V, but eventually abandoned this idea. In fact, after George had completed his work on theAlmagest, Jacobus Cremonensis, the Augustinian friar and translator of Archimedes, scarified George’s final text. Nicholas V seemed to support his criticism and probably proposed to George to make over some questionable passages. However, George rejected this idea. Later he dedicated various versions of his translation to Iacopo Antonio Marcello, to Mehmed II, and to Matthias Corvinus.But only in 1528 George's translation was revised and printed by Luca Gaurico, the present edition provided by the link. The aforementioned commentary however is not part of the volume and has only been preserved in manuscript form.In his work, Trapezuntius severely criticises subsequent interpreters of Ptolemy, including Theon of Alexandria, which provoked Georgius' controversy with Bessarion and resulted in Bessarion's engagement ofGeorg von PeuerbachandRegiomontanusfor a reliable edition and translation of the Almagest, theEpitoma in Almagestum Ptolemaei. Along with Theon, Georgius directed his criticisms against three other commentators of Ptolemy's astronomical masterpiece, namely the Andalusian astronomer and author of theCorrection of the AlmagestAbu Muhammad Jabir ibn Aflah (Geber), Thabit ibn Qurra (Thebit), and Levi ben Gershon (Gersonides). Thus, together with his other works, especially the translation and commentary on theCentiloquium, Georgius' translation aims at restoring the true, that is Greek, astrology/astronomy. In this attempt however, he failed: His numerous errors, misinterpretations of Ptolemy and contradictory claims were too much to tolerate for Bessarion and especiallyRegiomontanus, who severely criticised George in his unpublished manuscriptDefensio Theonis.The translation is accompanied by two introductory letters. In the first one, the translation's editor, sixteenth-century professor of astrology Luca Gaurico, praises the legacy of Ptolemy and provides his own translation of the famous Greek epigram at the time attributed to Ptolemy himself. The second letter is by Georgius' son Andrea, who thanks Gaurico for finally bringing his father's translation to light.
The margins are used to place helpful keywords and geometrical figures but also measuring devices like theInstrumentum monteregiensiswhich is certainly an anachronistic notion for George's original translation and hints at Gaurico adding material to the original manuscript.",Monfasani 1976Monfasani 1984Shank 2002,"Ptolemaeus, Claudius‎(← links)Gaurico, Luca‎(← links)Georgius Trapezuntius‎(← links)Defensio Theonis‎(← links)Cosmographia in tres dialogos distincta‎(← links)","Ptolemaeus, Claudius; Georgius Trapezuntius; Gaurico, Luca:Ptolemaei Almagestum Latina donatum lingua, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ptolemaei_Almagestum_Latina_donatum_lingua(last revision: 13.10.2021).",,"OA, MK, FB",Yes,"OA, FB",

For instance, it was customary to append a treatise too short for independent publication to some longer work, even if both texts were completely unrelated to each other. The addition of Giovanni Battista Baffi'sPythagoric Reflection, in Which Month a Child Should Be Born to Surviveto hisDe cometis libri tresis a case in point.The work, which comprises a bare nine quarto pages, features a separate title page, but as the reference on it to ""the same Giovanni Battista Venanzio Baffi"" indicates, a separate publication was not envisaged. Baffi dedicates his treatise to thegonfaloniere, theprioriand the citizens of his hometown Corinaldo, speaking in pompous words about the importance of one's fatherland in general and of his own love for Corinaldo. Gaspare Circino, who has already contributed a poem to the compendium on comets, praises Baffi as the glory of his homeland, comparing him to classical authors like Virgil or Cicero in this respect.The treatise itself starts from an address to Baffi's fellow citizens, but otherwise, it does not exhibit any traits of a letter. As the mention of Pythagoras in the title leads one to suspect, the reasoning is mostly based on numerology. The first four pages are exclusively taken up by exuberant praise of the number seven and its many wonderful properties, which manifest themselves, inter alia, in astronomy and music (for instance, the difference between summer and winter solstices, vernal and autumnal equinoxes is seven zodiacal signs on inclusive reckoning, p. [4]). From page five, embryological aspects come into play, but even then, Baffi again and again returns to his favourite number. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that a premature baby should preferably been born in the seventh month. However, this is not expressed in so many words, it rather has to be inferred by the reader.In general, Baffi's argument is rather torn apart than sustained by too many quotations from a huge number of authorities (including many poets, as in his work on comets). The material is presented haphazardly, and the train of thought is hard to follow. Many single statements even sound obscure in themselves. What, for example, shall one make of the following?Quin immo menses et anni septenario conficiuntur, et animalis corpus, quamdiu vivit, per septem nervorum paria regitur. In quo per triginta et unum septenarium numerus completur et instauratur.(""What is more, months and years are made up by the number seven, and the body of an animal is governed by seven pairs of nerves as long as it lives. In this, the number is fulfilled and restituted by thirty-one times seven""), p. [5].)

HisOne Thousand Questions and Answers from the Discipline of Mathematics, Which Pertain to the Cognizance of the Entire Universeaspire to give an encyclopaedic overview of the world at large. As the rest of the title specifies, this aim is to be achieved not primarily through mathematics in the present sense of the word, but rather through cosmology, geography, and astronomy.The book, which comprises close to 400 quarto pages, is introduced by a letter of dedication to three counts of Correggio, the author's hometown. The dedication is followed by one hexametric and two elegiac poems of praise, one for each count, by a certain Antonius Cerrius Montonensis. A table of contents presents a full list of all questions and answers. After some errata, aprooemium, which extols the work's subject, namely God's creation, introduces the catalogue of questions and answers. At the very end, a shortperoratio auctoris(""concluding word of the author"") again muses on the wonderful structure of the Universe, whose contemplation should direct man's thoughts towards God.The one thousand questions themselves are subdivided into three series, which are termedtractatusbut do not in fact constitute coherent treatises: although most questions form part of some thematic cluster, they do not follow each other in a stringent sequence (with the partial exception of the secondtractatus, the most unitary thematically). The firsttractatus(questions 1–451) deals with geometry, cosmology, astronomy, time reckoning, and general geography. The second  (questions 452–717) provides a chorographical overview of the earth. The last (questions 718–1000) discusses planetary astronomy.

The questions are all put in the subjunctive, as they depend on aquaeruntur, ""it is asked"", printed at the head of eachtractatus.

HisQuestions and Answers from Common Arithmetics, from Algebra and Geometry to be Treated in Mathematical Lectures and Seminarsemanate from his teaching. They are primarily directed at his students, who can buy the book ""for a reasonable price"" (parabili pretio) and spare themselves the labour of taking notes, as explained in the preface (fol. 2r). Because the students are mathematical novices and Weinhart has to make allowances for the weakest among them, any other readers are asked to condone the work's elementary level (fol. 2rv, 3v–4r). The choice of the catechism format is justified with its didactic efficiency: less gifted students (hebetiores) find it easier to understand the subject in this way, and the dialogic format is familiar to them from academic rituals such as disputations and exams (fol. 2v–3r).After the preface and an extended table of contents, the account, which comprises a little under 300 pages all in all, begins with elementary arithmetics (the concept of number, the four basic operations). This part is separately paginated and students who already have learned as much at school can buy the book without it (preface, fol. 2rv, 3v–4r). The rest of the work consists of the three parts already announced in the title. The arithmetical part leads from fractions to the extraction of roots and to geometric series. The short part on algebra introduces the reader to algebraic notation and the manipulation of algebraic equations. The longest part by far, the one concerned with geometry, is subdivided into three sections on geometry in one, two and three dimensions respectively and culminates in selected theorems from Euclid'sElements. In this part, the question and answer format, which is mostly retained otherwise, tends to vanish from sight in favour of lists of theorems (theoremata) and problems to be solved (problemata). The latter include many practical applications, in particular from surveying, a discipline in which Weinhart was very interested (for example, he taught and promoted the greatest Tyrolian surveyor and cartographer, Peter Anich). As is not uncommon in early modern works of elementary mathematics (Gärtner 2000, 273), the last pages (pp. 220–239) amount to a short treatise on the measurement of the capacity of barrels, a topic whose extended discussion is justified with its public usefulness (preface, fol. 3v).To further mathematical understanding in the modern sense of the word was not among Weinhart's primary goals. For the most part, he just defines mathematical entities and provides calculation recipes such asDignitas per dignitatem dividitur subtrahendo, non dividendo, numeros superius cohaerentes(""A power is divided by a power through subtraction, not division, of the exponents"", p. 73). These rules can even take the form of mnemonic verses. The single steps of the division, for instance, are condensed into the pentameterDivide, multiplica, subtrahe, pone, loca(""Divide, multiply, subtract, put down, locate"", p. 17 of the first, elementary part). Reasons are given but rarely (e.g. p. 168, on drawing a regular hexagon by applying the radius of a circle to its circumference:Ratio est, quia radius est latus hexagoni, ""The reason is that the radius is [the same as] the side of the hexagon""). In terms of style, simplicity and clearness are paramount, as emphasised in the preface (facilis, plana et dilucida, fol. 2v). The striving for clarity also underlies the work's rigorously hierarchical structure whose higher levels are initially presented to the reader in the abovementioned table of contents and at whose lowest level are the eponymous questions and answers. The text itself contains no diagrams, but references a number of diagrams placed on folding charts at the end of the work (unfortunately not visible in the digital copy).TheQuaestiones and responsatestify to the low level at which mathematics were taught at a provincial Austrian university in the later 18th century. They also show how a capable teacher reacted to the government's insistence on the practical utility of university teaching during the enlightened absolutist reign of Maria Theresia.

It falls into five parts: (1) disputations held by abaccalaureusunder apraeses1539–1752; (2) a supplement to the former leading up to 1763; (3) disputations held by doctors 1576–1752; (4) a supplement leading up to 1763; (5) a prosopography of the faculty. At least (2) and (4) were originally published apart from the rest, as is evident from the different years and printers on their title pages and from the date of the preface (see below). Finally, however, all five parts were reprinted – or simply put together – with a new common title page.In parts (1)–(4), the disputations are ordered by year and listed in tabular form. The person(s) involved and the question discussed are always indicated, the latter in the form on a single, often elliptical sentence such asAn cancro mammarum sectio?(""For breast cancer ectomy?"", part 1, p. 88). In parts (1) and (2), it is specified whether the question had to be answered yes or no (aff(irmatur)orneg(atur)), in parts (3) and (4), the exact date of the disputation is added. All in all, some 5000 items are presented in this manner.The volume is introduced by a short, but informative prefatory letter to thelector philiatro(""doctor-friendly reader"") dated 15 November 1752. Two points in particular are worth noting: First, the catalogue is based on printed material, in other words, it is a bibliography. This follows from the intimation that disputations had been held already in the Middle Ages, but since they had not been printed, the were lost. Second, the medical faculty of Paris knew two quite different disputation formats, one for thebaccalaurei, the other for the doctors. The former was highly formal. The argument had to be developed in strictly syllogistic form in five steps (major premise, confirmation, minor premise, confirmation, refutation of objections and conclusion). The language was expected to be characterized bystili elegantioris concinna et sententiosa maiestate(""harmonious and sententious loftiness of an elegant style""). The doctors' disputations seem to have been a freer format: There was nopraeses, and several doctors engaged in what could have been a relaxed conversation rather than a formal discussion, as the expression… problematum … viva voce inter doctores colloquentes discussorum et resolutorum …suggests. Such disputations took place at three occasions, namely the conferral of doctoral degrees,vesperiaeandregentiae(the meaning of the last two terms is unclear).The copy on display apparently belonged to some official of the faculty. It is abundantly annotated throughout in pencil and read ink, and the annotations testify to expert knowledge. Not only are there corrections and additions within the catalogues, both catalogues are also continued to the 1770s on blank pages inserted, it seems, for that very purpose. Moreover, additional columns are added, whose purpose is not completely clear but which seem to indicate the order in which the single items were bound together in folio and quarto volumes.TheSeries of Medical Questionssheds light not only on the history of the medical faculty at Paris and its academic customs, but also, potentially, on the early modern history of medicine at large. The variety of the questions contained in the volume is bewildering, captivating and amusing. Study of their uninterrupted development over more than two hundred years could yield interesting results regarding the evolution of medical thinking between the 16th and 18th centuries – all the more so, of course, should the volumes containing this rich material still be extant and traceable.",,"Baron, Hyacinthe-Théodore‎(← links)","Baron, Hyacinthe-Théodore:Quaestionum medicarum series chronologica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Quaestionum_medicarum_series_chronologica(last revision: 01.09.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Presenting a series of why questions followed by tentative answers, they offered a more straightforward pattern of dealing with difficult problems than the one  provided by the scholasticquaestio disputata(Lawn 1993). Among the most important textual models were a set of questions formulated in the school of Salerno around 1200 and the pseudo-AristotelianProblemata, which were rediscovered and translated in the Renaissance. From the 16th century, a number ofquaestionesbooks appeared which freely drew on sources such as these but also added new material. Often, questions about the natural world were intermingled with questions from other fields. While large collections sometimes showed encyclopedic aspirations, smaller ones could suggest topics for conversation, thus familiarising educated readers with scientific thinking.The presentBooklet of Natural Questionsby the Catalan physician Leonardo Giachini belongs to the second category, as already intimated by the short letter of dedication to the author's friend Ludovico Bonviso. Giachini chose him as dedicatee, he says, because the  questions presented in the book were once discussed by a group of six friends on Bonviso's estate near Force (a small town in the Italian Marche). In a note to the reader, Giachini excuses himself for some deviations from the opinions of Aristotle (thus implying that the Aristotelian tradition was an important source for hsim). He has made use of his freedom as a philosopher, he says, quoting the dictumnullius addictus iurare in verba magistri(""not bound to swear on any teacher's words"") from the beginning of Horace'sEpistles.Thequaestionesthemselves number 84 and fill 35 octavo pages. The better part deals with topics situated at the intersection of physiology and psychology, such as the emotions (esp. love), sex, sleep, dreams and memory. Some discuss ethical themes (qu. 66: querulousness of old people). Relevant natural scientific disciplines in the stricter sense include botany and zoology (qu. 78: cranes flying in wedge formation), meteorology (qu. 54: unsteadiness of good weather beginning at night), optics (qu. 80: disappearance of stars at sunrise), 'chymistry' (qu. 76: wax as lipophilic and hydrophobic) and technology (qu. 4–6: cannons). In the last case, three questions form a short series, as happens a couple of times. Most questions begin withCur …?(Why …?), most answers withAn quod / quia …?(""Perhaps because …?""), which is followed by further elucidations. The style is simple, clear and rather colloquial, as demonstrated by the following short example (qu. 22):Cur eos, qui diutius ex ira pallent, implacidiores saevioresque iudicamus?An quod argumento eo corporis temperaturam conicimus? Quod enim pauci sanguinis sint atque atra vel amara bile abundantes, benignitate succi illius quam minimum participant. Sanguis enim, tametsi pronos ad iram animos effingat, clementes tamen et placabiles reddere solet.""Why do we think that people affected by prolonged pallor when angry are hard to placate and grim?Perhaps because this gives us a clue how to estimate their bodily temperament? For because they have little blood and an excess of black and bitter bile, they have hardly any share in the good-naturedness conveyed by the former humour. For although blood lets people become hot-tempered, it usually makes them friendly and easy to mitigate as well.""","Lawn 1963, 132–33","Giachini, Leonardo‎(← links)","Giachini, Leonardo:Quaestionum naturalium libellus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Quaestionum_naturalium_libellus(last revision: 15.04.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In its heading (Ioannes Sapidus lectori salutem), the elegy is styled as a poetic epistle to the prospective reader, who is indeed addressed in its first and last lines. The poem opens with a promise that from the present book, the reader may learn the virtues of all herbs (v. 1–4). Next, theEiconesare praised in greater detail. There has been nothing as good as this work before; the medical properties of plants can be learned from it as precisely as from personal experience; the account is neither wordy nor so short as to become obscure (v. 5–14). The illustrator, Hans Weiditz, has provided superb images (v. 15–18). The printer, Johann Schott, has spared no costs and efforts to produce a magnificent volume (v. 19–22). In the final couplet, the reader, now assumed to be a doctor, is addressed again: he should definitely buy the book (v. 23–24).Sapidus obviously strives for an elevated style. The opening lines are inspired by the beginning of Ovid'sArs amatoria:Qui cupis ingenitas herbarum noscere vires / … / … / hoc lecto voti codice compos erisechoesSiquis in hoc artem populo non novit amandi, / hoc legat et lecto carmine doctus amet. The achievement of theHerbarum vivae eiconesis repeatedly compared to ancient accomplishments: None of the earlier centuries (nulla retro saecula, v. 5) have produced such a convenient work; Weiditz is no less famous than the Greek painter Apelles; the description of his illustrations alludes to the ancient cliché of the deceivingly lifelike work of art (v. 16, 18). A few comparisons and metaphors enhance Sapidus' account: the book is compared to a garden (v. 7) and Schott writescalamis aereis, ""with bronze quills"" (v. 21). On the other hand, the mundane notion of buying the book and paying for it is carefully avoided or circumscribed. The last line, for instance, does not say in so many words that the book is worth its money, but resorts to the contorted circumlocutionhoc operae pretium est nolle carere libro, ""it is worthwhile not to want to miss this book"".Such camouflage notwithstanding, among the various kinds of paratextual poems, this one clearly belongs to the advertising subgroup. Its focus is not on the author of the book in question or on the respective science, but on the book itself, and its aim simply consists in convincing the prospective reader to purchase it.",,"Herbarum vivae eicones‎(← links)Sapidus, Johannes‎(← links)","Sapidus, Johannes:Qui cupis ingenitas herbarum noscere vires …, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Qui_cupis_ingenitas_herbarum_noscere_vires_…(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

The record of the journey of the summer 1706, however, was not printed before 1723. As intimated in the first sentence of the present contribution (Perscripsit ante biennium historiam itineris sui Alpini anni MCCCVI ad perillustrem Societatem Regiam eiusdem socius Joannes Jacobus Scheuchzerus…), Scheuchzer sent it to the  Royal Prussian Academy in 1708, presumably in the hope to see it published in the Academy's journal, theMiscellanea Berolinensia. Instead, the text was only reviewed in theMiscellaneaby Christian Maximilian Spener, another member of the Academy – an exceptional measure, since the journal was otherwise exclusively dedicated to original work presented by members at their regular meetings. As Spener explains (p. 139), the travelogue proved too long for theMiscellanea(indeed, it fills no less than 75 folio pages in the 1723 edition), but was too interesting to pass it over in silence. The review (or rather preview) thus constituted a surrogate for the original account. That the text appeared under the (abbreviated) name of its author was uncommon in an early modern review, but conformed to the usual practice of theMiscellanea.Spener's account is an early example of a review making clear its own generic affiliation by the wordrecensioin its title. It comprises four and a half pages and closely follows Scheuchzer's route and narrative. The reader is led from Zurich and Lake Zurich to Lake Lucerne, the city of Lucerne and up to the top of Mt. Pilatus. The travel continues via Engelberg, where Mt. Titlis is climbed, and the lakes of the Bernese Oberland towards Bern. The last stages lead on to Fribourg, Morat, Avenches, Neuchâtel and back to Zurich. Some excursuses are incorporated as well. When a stone calleddraconitesis marveled at in Lucerne, this gives rise to a natural history of dragons in Switzerland (pp. 140–41). At the end, the barometric observations made by Scheuchzer during the whole journey and his description of 28 plants in an appendix are mentioned summarily and a Swiss Flora by him is announced (it apparently never appeared).Spener often reproduces Scheuchzer's lofty prose verbatim, as he announces at the beginning (ut plurimum ipsius auctoris verbis, p. 139). Nonetheless, Scheuchzer the author and traveller, whose personality makes itself strongly felt in the original account, very much recedes into the background in the review, as his thoughts and actions are mostly reported in the passive voice. The beginning of the narration, for example, is rendered with the help of the following verbs:describitur … narratur … additur … observatur … fit traiectus …(""it is described … told … added … observed … a transition is made…"", pp. 139–40). The effect of this technique is to foreground and at the same time to depersonalize the observations made. They appear as pieces of objective information which speak for themselves, independently of a specific person's movement in physical space, his reflections and feelings.",,"Spener, Christian Maximilian‎(← links)","Spener, Christian Maximilian:Recensio Itineris Alpini Ioannis Iacobi Scheuchzeri, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Recensio_Itineris_Alpini_Ioannis_Iacobi_Scheuchzeri(last revision: 07.07.2021).",RECENSIO,MK,Yes,MK,

The present example comprises only 25 pages and is conceived as a compendium of information otherwise dispersed in many different works. The short letter of dedication, addressed to no less a person than Henry VIII of England, clearly formulates this aim asnonnullas artis Apollineae praeceptiones diversis in voluminibus sparsas, quae ad corporalem valetudinem conducerent, in faciliorem modum reducere. The letter is followed by two epigrams (one of them half in Latin, half in Greek) by the author and a friend as well as by a table of contents. An appendix contains a thematically related work, a very short plague treatise.The contents of theRegimen sanitatisare partly inspired by thesex res non naturales, as customary in works of this kind, but there is much besides. The rationale behind the order of presentation is hard to figure out. In 30 chapters, the following topics are discussed: physical exercise (ch. 1), foodstuffs (chs. 2–7), sleep and waking (chs. 8–9), exercise (again) and rest (ch. 10), emotions (ch. 11), the right amount of food (chs. 12–13), the four elements (chs. 14–17), the four ages, seasons, and humours (chs. 18–20), the inner organs (ch. 21), pregnancy (ch. 22), rabies (ch. 23), how much to eat (again) and when (chs. 24–25), purging and vomiting (chs. 26–27), intoxication (ch. 28), sex (ch. 29), spices (ch. 30).Although Grospré writes formediciandstudiosi, as announced on the title page, his prescriptions are as a rule easy to understand and to follow. Much is commonsensical, including some psychosomatics:In regimine sanitatis nihil est melius quam habitare cum dilectis et iucundis.(""Regarding one's health regime, nothing is better than to live with beloved and likeable people"", ch. 11). Besides prescriptions for the preservation of one's health, some elementary medical and anatomical knowledge is imparted as well (e.g. ch. 21). The author's learning is displayed with moderation. Medical classics are invoked occasionallya, but not too often. The style is fluent and easy to read, although the author is fond of bold abstract nouns, which he perhaps coins ad hoc:Nam aqua maris sua terrestritate et grossitie ovi pondus sustinet …(""For seawater keeps an egg afloat because of its earthiness and densitude"", ch. 15).The book was quite successful. Within two years, four more editions appeared in Paris.

The third class, birds, will later be described in detail in Brisson’sOrnithologia - Ornithologie. As with this later work, theRegnum animaleresulted from Brisson’s work in René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur’s collection, as Brisson highlights in his detailed French preface. Moreover, the work is dedicated to Réaumur. In the already mentioned preface, Brisson’s explains his taxonomic system that is based on the hierarchical levels class, order, section, genus, and species. At times, there is no distinction between section and genus (as with Rhinoceros) if the section consists only of a single genus (according to Brisson’s taxonomy!). Moreover, Brisson mentions five characteristic features at most that help distinguish a taxon. He demonstrates this on the example of the beaver. Most important features are the shape and the number of teeth and fingers. Brisson values autopsy and therefore marked species that he has seen himself with two asterisks, those of which he has seen only part with one asterisk, and for the others, he relies on his references that he cited. A fair number of engravings (at least one per genus), have been drawn from original specimens.After a list of errata follows the short general part (p. 1–9) that introduces Brisson’s system and gives a short characterisation of his classes. This part and also most of the rest of the volume is bilingual and printed in two columns: The French column is always on the outside, the Latin on the inside of the page, i.e. the French column is on the right in uneven numbered pages, and on the left in even numbered pages; the Latin column vice versa. Brisson’s nine classes are the following:I)quadrupeda(terrestrial mammals)II)cetacea(whales and dolphins)III)aves(birds)IV)reptilia, (reptiles and amphibians)V)pisces cartilaginei, (cartilaginous fishes, that is, chondrichthyes)VI)pisces proprie dicti(""fishes proper"", that is, osteichthyes)VII)crustacea(arthropods except insects)VIII)insecta(insects)IX)vermes(worms, basically all the rest)After this general overview, Brisson deals with the first two classes in more detail (the much shorter part on class II begins on page 341). Each part is introduced by acatalogus authorum, in which he names his sources. Moreover, there is (in the case of the first class) a dichotomous key that helps the readers with the identification as it guides them to a certain species. 
The entries on the species have the following form: There is a French name as heading. Then follows a short description in Latin with the scientific name of the animal. After this, Brisson gives references and a detailed description. Sometimes synonyms (also from other vernaculars) are mentioned. The Latin is clear, but given the content, rather brief and technical.
At the end of each section, there is a table of content in French, followed by an index of French names and another index of names in all languages (French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, other vernaculars

However, it can also be understood as a review, not of a book, but of some new medical instruments which have been sent to the author lately, as he remarks by way of introduction.On three pages and one plate of copper engravings, Platner presents and evaluates four (groups of) instruments, which are somewhat unusually calledmachinaeinstead ofinstrumentaor the like, perhaps to highlight their ingenious design. These are a drill to extract the head of a dead fetus (p. 347, fig. I); four tools to reach an injured vein in order to sew it without doing additional damage (pp. 347–348, figs.

They are usually short and written in a non-technical language. Often, such early papers are culled from letters. The topics discussed as well as the forms of presentation may be taken over from older, established formats. The presentAccount of a Calflike-Human Monstrositytakes up the extremely popular subject ofmonstra, living beings markedly deviating from normal life forms, which were presented in innumerable pamphlets since the invention of print (for an example, see Jacob Ruf'sBroadsheet on Conjoint Twins).Themonstrumin question was washed ashore by the Weiße Elster, a river running through Zeitz in Saxony-Anhalt, on the 17 July 1681. Johann Schreyer, the town physician of Zeitz , who authored the present paper and probably sent it to theActa eruditorumas a letter, does not inform the reader how he came to see the strange being, but he presumably was called upon to inspect it in his professional capacity. As a physician, he not only was a medical expert but was also expected to see deeper into the working of nature than average men.The contribution comprises only a dozen lines all in all. It starts from a few introductory words about where themonstrumwas found and closes with the remark that an autopsy proved impossible due to its strong stench (intensissimus foetor). The central part, which occupies about three-quarters of the text, provides a concise but telling description of the strange being. Basically, it was similar to a calf with a human head, but most of its body parts were strangely deformed. Schreyer meets the challenge of describing such a wondrous creature by detailing the single body partsa capite ad pedes, giving most attention to the head. In doing so, he often helps himself by likening parts to those of different animals: the creature had the neck, the chest, and the forelegs of a calf, a human head, ears like a cat, a goat-like chin beard, and hind legs and a tail like a pig. In the end, some general features are given: themonstrumwas hairless, its skin was black, and it was female. Schreyer's language is graphic and precise. In the following extract, he even coins a new adjective,mitriformis, in order to describe a strange outgrowth on the monster's head.Huius in superiore parte eminebat velamentum membranaceum mitriforme corrugatum. Frons spithanum excedebat, et ubi desinit, oculi erant clausi, e quorum regione in utroque latere erigebantur aures felinis non maiores.From the head's upper part a membrane-like skin extended itself, which had the shape of a miter and was wrinkled. The forehead was higher than a span, and where it ended, there were the eyes, which were closed and in whose vicinity the ears stood up on either side, which were not bigger that those of a cat.Schreyer's verbal efforts are supplemented by a copper engraving presumably based on a depiction sent by him along with the letter.",,"Schreyer, Johann‎(← links)","Schreyer, Johann:Relatio de monstro vitulino-humano, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Relatio_de_monstro_vitulino-humano(last revision: 07.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Back in Spain, Hernández wrote a massive manuscript of several dozen volumes which were, however, not published, but kept in the library in the Escorial. There, the original was later destroyed by a fire in 1671. A digest was, however, prepared by Nardo Antonio Recchi in 1580.

Although nowadays the name of Benedetti is barely known, during his lifetime he was widely recognized as one of the leading mathematicians and experts in mechanics and physics. TheResolutiois his first surviving monograph concerned with mathematics, which he published at the age of 22. Therein, Benedetti treats all problems known fromEuclid(and some others) using a fixed compass. This is a compass that keeps its radius if taken away from the sheet; in theElements, Euclid uses a so-called collapsing compass which loses its radius if picked up. Theoretically, this is no restriction, as all constructions carried out with a fixed compass can be done by a collapsing compass as well. Practically, a fixed compass allows for simpler and faster solutions.In five books and on ca. 140 pages, he presents his elegant solutions for numerous geometric problems, at first stating the respectiveproblema, then revealing his thoughts on it and referring to copious illustrations, which are an integral part of the explanations.However, the work is famous not for its geometrical content but for Benedetti's (anti-Aristotelian) hypothesis on free falling bodies: The 20-pages dedication letter to Gabriel de Guzman proposes that the speed of a free-falling body is determined by its specific weight compared to the one of the medium in which it moves, not by its absolute weight, as Aristoteles had it. If Benedetti's reflections influencedGalileo Galilei'sthoughts on free falling bodies in hisDe motuis debated. There are conceptual similarities but Galileo's silence on Benedetti rather indicates that he might not have been aware of Benedetti's results. The reason for the curious placement of a non-geometrical question in this book is probably to protect his thoughts from idea theft by their quick publication which in fact happened: Jean Traisnier stole the version from Benedetti's subsequently publishedDemonstratio proportionum motuum localium contra Aristotelem et omnes philosophos, a theft being only discovered in 1741 (Dict. Sci. Bio., vol. 1, 606).In the end, a complete table of Euclid's problems indicates where they could be found in theResolutiowhere their order has apparently changed.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 1, 604-609","Benedetti, Giovanni Battista‎(← links)Diversarum speculationum mathematicarum et physicarum liber‎(← links)","Benedetti, Giovanni Battista:Resolutio omnium Euclidis problematum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Resolutio_omnium_Euclidis_problematum(last revision: 21.02.2022).",,FB,Yes,"JL, FB",

The most peculiar text is Vossius' letter. It is preceded by a short note to the reader. In it, Vossius states that the letter was criticized by unnamed quibblers (Aristarchi) while circulating in manuscript. He therefore publishes it so that everyone can decide for himself whether these reproaches are justified or not.The letter discusses various questions related to mechanics. The style and language of the piece are clear, although it remains unknown to what Vossius actually ""responds""; nor does he mention to whom he sends his response. Vossius' epistle lacks the beauty of humanist Latin and, in line with the rest of the edition, remains quite technical in treating newly discovered laws of mechanics. Throughout the piece and until the very last page, Vossius does not name any scholars on whose works he relies, but, eventually, he recommends his friend to consult the works of Galileo Galilei.

At the beginning of the report, Borelli states that he was recently informed about the publication of Honore Fabri's ""physical dialogues"" in which the latter dealt with the topics to which Borelli had devoted his writings. Throughout the opening pages of the report, Borelli constantly acknowledges the scholarly achievements of Fabri enumerating some of his most influential and insightful scientific discoveries. However, under the guise of the apparent appreciation, Borelli accuses his opponent of plagiarising his mathematical and physical findings or – he admits that possibility – completely ignoring them. With the latter case, though, Borelli states that although his work could possibly remain completely unknown to Fabri, the similarities between the two are remarkable.The main body of the text presents a detailed review of such similarities and resembles modern scholarly reviews in terms of the structure of the argument and the way of expression. Borelli usually indicates the respective pages of Fabri's text and hits back at him with providing extensive references to his own writings thus comparing the texts and consequently indicating how Fabri plagiarised his conclusions or used them without indicating his source. Sometimes, Borelli supplements his argument with mathematical drawings. Borelli concludes his report by saying that on the basis of the provided evidence, no one could doubt that what Fabri presented as his own findings had significantly drawn from his work.
Given Borelli's high position within the scientific community and theres publica letteraria, the review represents an exceptional example of plagiarism debates in the early modern period.

As explained in an opening letter to the Polish intelligentsia (pp. 9–13), it was Mizler's aim to make Polish intellectual live better known in in the rest of Europe, where it was commonly despised. The journal was conceived as a continuation of Mizler's ownWarschauer Bibliothek, of which four issues had been published in 1753/54; the switch from German to Latin was meant to ensure that the journal could be read in Poland itself and abroad ([p. 6]). Four issues per year were published. They contain a mix of reviews of books from Poland or by Polish authors on the one hand and original contributions on the other. The reviews are not conceived as simple summaries (nudae recensiones), but try to extract the gist of the respective work, along with corrections and additions (succum eorum et sanguinem utilissimum extractum, corrigendo atque addendo, quae utilia videbuntur, p. 11).Among the pieces contained in the first issue, there is the present five-pages review of aTraité des fièvres malignes épidémiques(Dresden 1738) by Jacques Émilien Camuset, one of Mizler's predecessors as personal physician to the king of Poland. As partly announced in the programmatic statement quoted above, the review is quite peculiar in several respects. Its most normal aspect is the summary provided of the contents of the treatise:  a definition offebris maligna, a description of the epidemic raging in Poland in 1737, a theoretical analysis of the symptoms of the disease and of the right kind of treatement plus an appendix of twelve case studies, three of which are translated into Latin by Mizler. It is less common that the summary is interspersed with a number of critical remarks. For instance, Camuset mentions a few symptoms in the explanation of the fever which he is said to have ""wrongly"" omitted in its description before (pluria symptomata in explicatione affert, quae male in descriptione huius febris malignae omisit, p. 64). Even more peculiar are some substantial additions. At the beginning, one finds a general reflection on the necessity for doctors to read their colleagues' observations. A footnote running over two pages (pp. 63–64) discusses the interpretation of the remarks in Sirach 38 about the right attitude towards doctors. Finally, one wonders which profit readers could possibly draw from a review of a book published a full 17 years ago. In sum, Mizler's text provides a telling example of the lack of standardization in mid-18th century reviews.

In general, the make of the review corresponds to the standards of theCommentarii de rebus in scientia naturali et medicina gestis(for which journal cf. theReview of: Verhandelingen uitgegeeven door de Hollandse Maatschappy der Weetenschappen te Harlem.

The review itself basically is a summary of the books structure and contents.However, the reviewer apparently was less than enthusiastic about the speech and did not want to waste too much space, time and energy on it. His review is not just short, it also lacks any form of introduction and circumstantial information, for instance regarding the work's origin and sociological context. On several occasions, dissent is voiced: Moscatipersuadet sibi(""convinces himself"" – but not, it seems, the reviewer) that people first got the idea of practicing chemistry when they watched volcanic eruptions.

The select bibliography towards the end of the book (pp. 67–90) is called ""short and incomplete"". The extensive notes (pp. 37–63) are passed in silence. Towards the end of the summary, the reviewer seems to tire of writing full sentences and changes over to a telegraphic style:Arabum vagae locutiones et somnia, vani imitatores inter Europaeos, multa auctorum alchemicorum nomina cum libris ab iis editis et nonnullis vitae eorum conditionibus ex historia philosophiae hermeticae a Langlet du Fresnoy exarata excerptis …The Arabs' aimless talk and dreams; their fruitless imitators among the Europeans; many names of alchemical authors together with their books and something about their personal circumstances, taken out of Lenglet du Fresnoy'sHistoire de la philosophie hermétique …Nonetheless, the decencies are observed.

Its first part is dedicated to the explanation of the problem (after the detection of the precession and nutation of the earth and the moon's libration, one wants to know if the other planets behave in a similar way), a price advertised by the Academy of St. Petersburg in 1756 for precise observations leading to an answer, the failure of this attempt due to the inability of astronomers to make such observations and the intervention of Euler who produces a theoretical solution based solely on the laws of mechanics.

Its opening section (pp. 304–7) praises the author, defines the general aim of the book as finding the forces behind the observable movements of bodies, and summarizes the its introductory sections: the definitions, the three Newtonian laws of motion, and thelemmatain which Newton sketches his methodology. After that (p. 307), the reviewer explains that he originally planned to provide a digest of the first two books but soon realized that such a summary would become much too long. He therefore only indicates the themes of these books in general terms and provides a selective list of more specific topics discussed by Newton (pp. 307–10). Subsequently, Newton's description of the solar system in the last book is presented in a similar manner (pp. 310–15), with special emphasis on the discussion of the comets in which the reviewer seems to be particularly interested (pp. 313–15).Apart from a few laudatory expressions, the account of thePrincipiais purely descriptive. There is no discussion of the correctness of Newton's methods and results, still less anything like criticism of them. Often, the reviewer writes in note form in order to safe space, indicating the place of respective subjects within thePrincipiain marginalia. This is true, for instance, in the following passage from the beginning of the discussion of books one and two (p. 308, marginalia added in square brackets):[Lib. I, sect.

A well-informed and attentive reader could even extract important specific information, as did Leibniz, who states on p. 92 of hisTentamen de motuum coelestium causisthat he learned about Newton's inverse-square law of gravition (although not about Newton's reasons for postulating it) from the present review.",,Anonymus 20‎(← links),"Anonymus 20:Review of: Isaaci Nevvton Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Review_of:_Isaaci_Nevvton_Philosophiae_naturalis_principia_mathematica(last revision: 16.08.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Berlin 1779(Google Books)Review of: Lambert, Pyrometrie (1776)(IZWT Wuppertal)",863738,"Printed in the April issue of theNova Acta Eruditorum1776, this review discusses a book – thePyrometrie oder vom Maaße des Feuers und der Wärmeof the brilliant mathematican and physicist Johann Heinrich Lambert – which appeared only in 1779, two years after the death of its author! As Lambert's colleague, the mathematician Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karsten, explains in the preface (""Vorrede"") to thePyrometrie(pp. III–IX, here IV–V), the work was still unfinished in march 1777 and Lambert completed it only a few days before his death on 25 September 1777. TheNova Actamust have been several years behind schedule at the time, a hypothesis confirmed by the expressionbeatus auctor(""the blissfully deceased author"") used for Lambert in the review.The preface just mentioned is of interest in another respect as well: Like the review, it does not aspire to a systematical  summary of the book's contents, but mainly devotes itself to elucidating some of the fundamental tenets of Lambertian thermodynamics. Moreover, both texts start with a hint at the belated publication of thePyrometrie, which was announced by its author as early as 1760, and end with the concession that some aspects of Lambert's reasoning must remain conjectural for the moment (while showing the greatest respect for Lambert otherwise). Karsten therefore seems a good candidate for the authorship of the review as well.The review is quite extended, as it covers a full ten pages. After the aforementioned remarks regarding the publication history, the text first praises Lambert's achievement of having brought thedisiecta membraofpyrometria(""fire measurement"", roughly thermodynamics) into a system, and discusses the relationship between this discipline and the measurement of light (photometria), one of Lambert's earlier interests (pp. 162–63). Subjects discussed in the main part of the review include the expansion of bodies at temperature rise, the question whether this expansion provides a reliable indication of temperature, the (basically Newtonian) laws of heat exchange between a body and its surroundings, the different heat capacities of different substances and an atomistic theory of heat which is supposed to consist of minuteparticulaeof fire.The review clearly caters to readers who already have some basic understanding of the field. It is considerably more technical than reviews written before, say, the middle of the 18th century. Among other things, this technical character shows in the inclusion if some charts tabulating experimental results (p. 168) and in the expression of physical laws in mathematical formulas (pp. 165–167, 170). Also the text itself is not easy to understand due to the complexity and, for the modern reader, strangeness of the argument, the classicizing, occasionally complex syntax and the technical terminology. What we would call the low heat capacity and small coefficient of thermal expansion of quicksilver today, is expressed as follows by the reviewer (p. 170):Dum nimirum eaedem particulae igneae mercurium permeant, vires earum duplum propemodum augentur, quo fit, ut idem digitus cubicus massae igneae in hoc fluido comprimatur fere ad 9/40 digiti cubici.""For of course, when the same fiery particles pervade quicksilver, their power is strengthened by a factor of about two, which is why the same cubic inch of fiery substance [by which 30 cubic inches of spirit of wine are extended] is compressed to about 9/40 of a cubic inch in this liquid.""",,Anonymus 13‎(← links),"Anonymus 13:Review of: Lambert, Pyrometrie, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Review_of:_Lambert,_Pyrometrie(last revision: 15.12.2021).",RECENSIO,MK,Yes,MK,

The present review summarizes and explains the contents of these treatises in the way that is standard in theActa eruditorumand in other early modern journals. A remarkable aspect is the amount of space and energy devoted to familiarising the reader with Newton's terminology. The title of the first treatise, for instance, is explained as follows (p. 31):Quod enumerationem linearum attinet, notat in antecessum lineas dici posse primi, secundi, tertii, quarti etc. ordinis, quas recta potest secare in punctis uno, duobus, tribus, quattuor etc.(""Regarding the numbering of the lines, Newton remarks beforehand that those which a straight line can cut in one, two, three, four points and so on, can be called of the first, second, third, fourth order and so on."")In modern discussions of the priority controversy between Newton and Leibniz, this review is often mentioned because of a passage on pp. 34–35, in which the reviewer reacts to a remark about the invention of the calculus in the introduction to Newton's second treatise (pp. 165–166). There, Newton recounts his development of the method offluxiones(fluxions, his name for the derivative of a function describing the change of a given quantity in time) in 1665–1666. He does so without mentioning Leibniz's version of the differential calculus, although this was published years before Newton's method of fluxions. The reviewer remarks that Newton'sfluxionesare the same as thecalculus differentialis, whoseinventoris Leibniz, and adds a remark to the effect that Newton merely presented an already discovered method in new garb. When the review came to Newton's attention a few years later, he was furious. Whether he was justified in his reaction is debated (Anthony 1960, 69–70;Hall 1980, 138–141). In any case, it should be noted a) that although Leibniz is generally supposed to be the author of the present review, this is apparently just a plausible guess; b) that if he is the author, nothing should be made of the fact that the review appeared anonymously, since this was the rule in theActa eruditorum; c) that a short aside in a quite long and detailed review was probably not intended as a strong statement in a priority dispute; and d) that the reviewer is otherwise complimentary to Newton throughout, calling himingeniosissimus auctorin the very paragraph under scrutiny, for instance.",Anthony 1960Hall 1980,"Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm‎(← links)Review of: Isaac Newton, Tractatus duo(redirect page) ‎(← links)De quadratura curvarum‎(← links)","Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm:Review of: Newton, Tractatus duo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Review_of:_Newton,_Tractatus_duo(last revision: 03.05.2021).",RECENSIO,"DB, MK, FB",Yes,MK,

Derde Deel(Biodiversity Heritage Library),657724,"In early modern times, reviews were written not only of books, but of single volumes of journals as well. In theCommentarii de rebus in scientia naturali et medicina gestis(1752–1808), the first important scientific review journal ever (Kronick 1976, 162), journal issues usually came first, followed by normal books. The oldest scientific society of the Netherlands, the Hollandse Maatschappij der Wetenschappen, began to publish itsVerhandelingen uitgegeeven door de Hollandse Maatschappij der Wetenschappen te Haarlemin 1754. After the first volume had already been discussed in vol. VI (1757), 309–23 of theCommentarii, the third volume, which appeared in 1757, was reviewed with some delay in 1761 on the opening pages of vol. IX .The volume under review contains 27 contributions, mainly articles plus some shorter notes and meteorological observations, which discuss medical, astronomical, physical, mathematical, meteorological, geological and technological issues. The anonymous reviewer goes through these in the order in which they appear in the volume, indicating 14 by author and title only, while providing summaries of the other 13. His selection criteria remain unclear. The c. 700 pages of the volume are condensed to some 20 pages in the review. The first page of each article and of the parts of longer articles are indicated in the margins. There is no critical examination at all of contents and arguments. The reviewer also refrains from passing any judgement, except for the occasional praising epithet such ascl(arissimus), ""very famous"", for an author. The contents of the original contributions are rendered into clear and simple Latin. The reason why wind feels cool, for instance, is explained as follows (p. 7):Est vero recreationis refrigerationisque, quae corpori humano ab aëre moto contingit, ratio haec: Cum calor in corpore naturalis 92 vel 94 gradus thermometri Fahrenheytiani cernatur, sequitur calorem in homine eum, qui in aëre insit, longe superare. Quare in illam aëris portionem, quae hominis superficiei proxima est, si in quiete sit constituta, caloris copia ingreditur et sic humanum corpus circumdatum est atmosphaera aliqua calida, cuius calorem ipse homo percipit. Iam spirante vento dispergitur haec atmosphaera atque homo hanc caloris privationem sentiens frigoris gradum percipit.The reason of the refreshment and cooling which the human body receives from air in motion is the following: Because the natural warmth in the body is seen to be 92 or 94 degree Fahrenheit, it follows that the warmth in a person is far greater than that in the air. Therefore an amount of warmth passes into that part of the air which is closest to the surface of the person, provided the air is in rest, and so the human body is surrounded by a certain warm atmosphere, whose warmth is perceived by the respective person. But when the wind blows, this atmosphere is dispersed and the person who feels this deprivation of warmth perceives a certain degree of coldness.The main purpose of a journal review like the present one was to inform the readers all over Europe – theCommentariiwere sold, besides Germany, in the Netherlands, England and Italy, as indicated on the title page – of the respective volume's contents in compact form and in an internationally understandable language. Few people were able to read Dutch fluently (even the reviewer himself makes orthographical mistakes in the journal's title:Maatschappy,Weetenschappen,Haarlem) but some may nonetheless have procured themselves the respective volume of theVerhandelingenfor closer study. For most, however, the review served not as a guide to the original, but as a substitute for it. This is still its function today, as theVerhandelingenare not available online and apparently very hard to come by.",,Anonymus 11‎(← links)Review of: Discorso dei vantaggi della educazione filosofica nello studio della chimica‎(← links),"Anonymus 11:Review of: Verhandelingen uitgegeeven door de Hollandse Maatschappy der Weetenschappen te Harlem.

In the 1610s, Galilei and Scheiner exchanged several letters in which they debated the origin of sunspots, from that moment on seen not as celestial bodies orbiting around the Sun but certain phenomena on the surface of the Sun. Apart from that, and more importantly, they discussed priority questions regarding their scientific discoveries. Claiming that he was behind the discovery of the sunspots, Galileo mocked Scheiner, who, in his opinion, sought to combine newly revealed astronomical findings with Christian teaching and thus refused to accept the fact that sunspots were on the surface of the Sun. After the 1610s, Galilei did not continue to investigate the sunspots' nature. Scheiner, on the contrary, developed his argument over the subsequent twenty years, which resulted in the publication of theRosa Ursina.The massive work, whose four books comprise nearly 800 quarto pages, is dedicated to Paolo Giordano II Orsini, Duke of Bracciano. This explains the linguistic game in the title with the wordursus(bear) and the name of Scheiner's addressee Orsini as well as the presence of several images of the bear in the engraving which adorns the title page. After admitting that in some respect his previous conclusions on the nature of sunspots should be reconsidered, Scheiner provides a detailed analysis of all astronomical and physical features concerned with the nature, position, and influence of the Sun. By observing the movement of the sunspots he is able to identify the Sun's axis and measures its inclination to the ecliptic by 7°30' (only deviating by 15' from the modern measurements of 7°15') criticizing Galileo for neglecting this observation. Interestingly, in most cases, he calls himself ""Apelles"" thus referring to the earlier debate with Galileo since he was asked by Jesuit officials to refrain from using his own name and thus signed his letters with this pseudonym. Along with scientific observations of the origin of sunspots and other related matters, Scheiner remains loyal to his attempt to reconcile his findings with Scripture. This becomes clear especially from Part 2 of the treatise in which while working through the nature of the Sun, Scheiner explores theological interpretations of the subject in question.

In 1541, Honterus versified his own text and enlarged it to four books, splitting the geography section in two books and adding another, basically lexicological book (see below). In this form, he printed the work in his own printing shop in Brașov / Kronstadt. One year later, a revised and again somewhat enlarged version in nearly 1400 hexameters came out at the same place. This definitive version proved extremely popular. Nearly 100 editions and reprints (of which the one presented here is the earliest available online) appeared until the end of the 17th century. Moreover, parts of the work were recycled in other publications as well.Book 1 provides an astronomical, astrological, and meteorological overview of the universe. Book 2 is dedicated to the physical and political geography of Europe, book 3 to Asia, Africa and the islands. (There is no mention of the New World; Honterus' account is entirely pre-Columbian and pre-Copernican.) Book 4 covers many aspects of living nature and human life: parts of the human body, animals, plants, human anatomy, political functions, professions and crafts, kinship relations, instruments and other paraphernalia, food and drink, and diseases. While terms and things are taught in combination in the better part of the work (cf. the injunction on the last page:nec tamen ista / nomina cum propriis pigeat perdiscere rebus), book 4 focusses nearly exclusively on terminology. Many lines are pure word lists of the typelepra, elephantiasis, cancer, gangraena, parulis(book 4, next-to-last page). Accordingly, the last book is announced as a separate work on the title page of some later editions. In fact, however, all four books form a unity, as they provide a poetic inventory of the natural and human world. Honterus may simply have felt that human culture was more familiar and needed less explanation than cosmology and geography. Appended to the text, one finds four schematic representations of the sky, the universe and the earth at large as well as twelve regional maps.The work exemplifies a branch of didactic poetry which has no poetic ambitions but only aims at conveying facts in an appealing, easily memorable way. The work starts without a real proem, and the account contains no similes, ekphrases and mythological digressions – in short nothing of the poetic panoply that is typical of the ancient tradition represented by authors like Hesiod, Aratus, Lucretius, Virgil and Manilius. The only elements going beyond the simple enumeration and explanation of names and things are some ornamental epithets (e.g.profundum caelum, ""deep sky"", book 1, [pp. 2–3]), a few first-person statements (including a final lament over the difficult times in which Honterus has to live and work), some addresses to the reader such as the above-mentioned injunction, and regular announcements of the topics to be discussed next. The last-mentioned include an opening five-line summary of the work's contents at large as well as a number of one-line announcements likenomina ventorum posthac patriamque docebo(""next, I will teach the names and places of origin of the winds"", next-to-last page of book 1).The publication completely lacks introductory paratexts which could inform one about the intended readership and use. However, its predecessor was meant as a schoolbook, and this presumably is true of theBasic Description of the Worldas well. That the work was used as a textbook is proven by a copy at Zurich containing a note that Gessner lectured on it (Leu 2008, 240).",Offner et al. 2017,"Honterus, Johannes‎(← links)Rudimentorum cosmographiae libri duo‎(← links)","Honterus, Johannes:Rudimenta cosmographica, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Rudimenta_cosmographica(last revision: 27.06.2021).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

This is followed by some information about the sublunar world and the earth at large: the elements, the zones andclimata(see below), the cardinal directions. The book is concluded by a list of stars and star signs with different names (mostly a Greek one followed by its Latin equivalent). The geographical and chorographical second book (fols. [A vii r]–[B viii r]) divides the earth into the three continents Europe, Asia and Africa (America is nonexistent), which are described country by country, followed by the seas and their islands. Analogously to its predecessor, the book ends with a bilingual word list, this time a vernacular – Latin one of place names and ethnonyms.Even apart from the final sections, theTwo Books of the Basics of Cosmographylargely consist of enumerations. This is particularly conspicuous in book two, where the description of Italy (fol. B ii r), for instance, comprises 26 peoples and tribes, 51 cities, 13 rivers, four mountains and seven capes. Much of the rest of the text is taken up by phrases introducing lists and by definitions of the respective categories. The notion ofclima, for example, is initially defined as follows:Clima est spatium terrae inter duos parallelos, in quo dies per semihoram variatur a proximo(""A clima [zone] is a space between two parallel circles, within which the [longest] day differs by half an hour from [the longest day in] the next"", fol. [A 5 v]). After this, eightclimataare enumerated.  One catalogue of star signs is in verse, because it has been borrowed from a poem by Ausonius (fols. [A iiii r–v]). Others take the form of small tables; this applies to the zodiacal signs and their symbols, for instance (fol. A iii r). A woodcut of the globe, the winds and the cardinal directions is inserted into the text (fol. [A vi r]; in simplified form, it also figures on the title page). Moreover, there is a folding world map a few pages before the end. As evident from the examples already adduced, the Latin is simple and unadorned.The book was reasonably successful, as the first edition from 1530 was reprinted in 1534. However, the work soon was overshadowed by Honterus' later, enlarged and versified, version, theRudimenta cosmographica.

However, the book's very shortness allows Gessner to dispense with a systematic presentation, and at least some guidance is provided by marginalia. The language is simple, the precepts given (eat and drink moderately, exercise a bit, be happy, avoid unmotivated phlebotomy etc.) are commonsensical and not too hard to obey.

Hermolaus Barbarus'Compendium scientiae naturalis ex Aristotelerepresents the Renaissance stage of this tradition. The presentCompendium of the Science of Nature or Physicsby the versatile and successful surgeon, physician and naturalist Johann von Muralt is situated near its end and constitutes a late counterpart to Barbarus' work. The book was written on the one hand for Muralt’s pupils at the Carolinum in Zurich, as stated in the full title, although it remains unclear if Muralt used it as a textbook there. On the other hand, the compendium caters to the general reader, thecandidus lectorto whom the preface is addressed. The preface's last sentence anticipates Muralt'sSystema physicae experimentalis, which appeared in four tomes between 1705 and 1714. In hindsight, the present work looks like a preliminary short version of this opus magnum.The text of theCompendiumcomprises some 200 octavo pages. Its macrostructure betrays its late date: towards the end of the 17th century, the Aristotelian framework was still in use, but its insufficiency to accomodate the entire knowledge about the natural world had become evident. The first three parts of Muralt's work are traditional, treating physics in general, the science of the skies and meteorology. The first three parts of Muralt's work are traditional, treating physics in general (pp. 5–29), the science of the skies (pp. 30–42) and meteorology (pp. 42–47). By contrast, the remaining parts,Anthropologia(pp. 47–91),Zoologia(pp. 92–138),Phytologia(pp. 139–189), andMineralogia(pp. 189–208), partly correspond to Aristotelian biology and meteorology, but the field has been restructured: starting from the most dignified creature, man, Muralt descends via animals and plants to minerals, using the early modern notion of the three kingdoms of Nature as his guiding principle. The single parts are subdivided into chapters, within which each sentence forms a separate, numbered paragraph. Most of these sentences give definitions or subdivide a previously mentioned generic term into its species, as is customary in textbooks and compendia.Aristotelian philosophy has been updated not only structurally, but also in terms of contents. As one may see at one glance from the concluding index, numerous early modern findings and notions have been added. The reader learns of microscopes, blood circulation, andvortices(pp. 15, 16, 31), and the constituents of the human body are analysed in terms of contemporary chymistry (pp. 48–50). Physicotheological thinking (Blair; Greyerz 2020) plays an important role as well. On p. 7, for instance, the term ""nature"" is defined as follows:Natura est internum agendi et patiendi principium corporeum Dei manum et mentem clarissime indicans.""Nature is the inner principle of acting and being acted-upon of bodies, which most clearly demonstrates the hand and mind of God.""The work's neat structure, its overseeable layout, the logical progression from one piece of information to the next, and the simple, precise Latin make for a maximum of clarity. That MuraltsCompendiumwas never republished in spite of its merits is perhaps due to the rapid decline of the Aristotelian tradition at large.

It combines the praise of the erudition that Finland acquired through the foundation of the academy with panegyric on king Charles XI of Sweden and his wife (who are also the dedicatees of the print) on the occasion of his 35th birthday.The highly stylized oration of 70 octavo pages length is designed to demonstrate the classical education and eloquence that found a new home in Finland. Held in grand style and filled with pathos, the festive speech showcases a wealth of rhetorical figures and frequently references ancient literature andexemplafrom Greco-Roman antiquity. Moreover, the oration exhibits a strong religious streak, constantly relating the praise to god and ending with a prayer.In praising the various fields of knowledge taught at the academy, Achrelius uses the magnet as a leitmotif (pp. 13–15): like the unremarkable stone that surpasses all others thanks to its innate powers, the “magnet of sciences”, though not valued everywhere, encloses all knowledge inside itself. Its magnetic powers attract the human mind away from the earth and towards the heavens (theology), repel injustice (law) and illnesses (medicine) and let rhetoric, poetry, and history flourish.Although the natural sciences have a less prominent role in the text, several pages are devoted to them (pp. 25–33). The beauty of nature – both of the (geocentric) cosmos and the earth – is praised lavishly: the passage starts with anekphrasisof the palace of Constantine, which for all its splendour cannot compete with themundi paradisum(p. 26), whose grandiosity is exalted with grand rhetoric ornament and amplification. Thanks to their singular, divine gift of reason, humans can explore the fabric of nature by means of various scientific disciplines (mathematics, chemistry/alchemy, botany and medicine are named). Of particular interest is the depiction of the scientific method by the orator:Sicque non per praecepta vulgaria, non quaestiunculas generales, sed per visibilia, quae facta sunt, ad invisibilium ubertatem, a virtute in virtutem, ab experientia in experientiam, a tempore ad aeternitatis contemplandam sapientiam pie adsurgimus, devote festinamus, tenemus simpliciter(p. 29).

The print's frontispiece shows him giving the talk in front of a very numerous audience.In terms of content, Boerhaave warns scientists not to have too great confidence in the power of their own intellect. We cannot achieve an understanding of the principles of things, he says, but only of sense data, from which logical conclusions may then be deduced. The talk begins with the assertion that the first principles of nature are unaccessable to us. Next, this thesis is confirmed by the demonstration that all alleged principles (atoms, void, extension etc.) ultimately fail. Not even such a simple notion as the idea of movement can really be understood. The principle of life is utterly obscure (even if there is always an egg involved). How the proprieties of the various species are passed on to the next generation is unimaginable. A thing as seemingly simple as a human hair is in reality infinitely complex and far from being correctly understood at present. What should then be said of the human body as a whole? Already the presocratics could reach no consensus about nature's first principles. Since then, no school of thought has been successful in this respect. The total failure of such great thinkers like Descartes and Huygens in natural philosophy is enough to indicate how desperately difficult things are in this field. However, one should not conclude from this that scientific progress is impossible. The Scientific Revolution of the last two centuries – to which the University of Leiden has made splendid contributions – proves the opposite. The speech ends with the formal deposition of the rectorate and the annuntiation that the next rector will be proclaimed in a moment.The thrust of Boerhaave's oration is typical of the epistemological scepticism that dominated many areas of European thought since the rediscovery of Sextus Empiricus in the 16th century and in the sciences abolished the search for Aristotelian principles and causalities. In fact, the text reads like an anticipation of the agnostic pragmaticism of present-day science: We do not know what mass, charge etc. actually are, but never mind – as long as we can reckon with these notions, that is enough.As befits an academic oration, Boerhaave's style is moderately Ciceronian; however, he does not write overlong periods and is unafraid of postclassical vocabulary. Many apostrophes to a single listener enliven the talk. Boerhaave is particularly impressive in his precise and captivating descriptions of natural phenomena (e.g. pp. 30–38 on the hair). In his praise of great scientists (pp. 49–52), he strives for hymnical loftiness.It should be noted that the present text belongs to a Leiden microtradition (in which the Boerhaave family had a considerable share) of printed academic orations and poems of various kinds. Many of them are concerned, as in this case, with theoretical, especially epistemological, questions, and some served to mark the end of the speakers rectorate (De ingenii humani praestantia;De nihilo nobis penitus cognito;Sermo acdemicus de chemia suos errores expurgante;Declamatio academica de gaudiis alchemistarum).The oration was reprinted twice, in 1718 and 1721. In 1718, the theologian Ruurd Ruurds from the University of Franeker fiercely attacked Boerhaave's position and went as far as to accuse him of heterodoxy, but was restrained by his own superiors. A Dutch translation was published in 1918 (Cohen; Renkema 1918, 55 ff.).","Cohen; Renkema 1918Lindeboom 1968, 100–102","Boerhaave, Herman‎(← links)Cohen; Renkema 1918‎(← links)Oratio de dignitate et utilitate matheseos‎(← links)Sermo academicus de chemia suos errores expurgante‎(← links)","Boerhaave, Herman:Sermo academicus de comparando certo, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Sermo_academicus_de_comparando_certo(last revision: 20.04.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In it, Kaau praises medicine and physicians as important for humankind as they maintain or restore health, an godlike ability (medicum enim qui dicit, hominem vocat alteri Deum; p. 5).Kaau holds the opinion that the human body consists of just two things: vessels and liquids (p. 7 f). It is therefore necessary to understand the principles of these things and how to maintain and restore them as illnesses and diseases are the result of disorder in either a vessel or a liquid. Thus, a good physician needs a sound knowledge of geometry, mechanics, and hydraulics. Comparative anatomy is also important as the study of bodies of animals can be helpful to understand the human body. As plants, animals, and minerals have an influence on the liquids in the body either as poisons or asmateria medica, Kaau recommends to study them (e.g. p. 29). He argues for a 'chemical' treatment (ars spargyrica; p. 31) of illnesses in succession ofParacelsusandvan Helmont. The oration on medicine and physicians ends on page 33, then follows a eulogy on Peter the Great (p. 34–39), his wife Katharina (p. 39), and finally their daughter Elisabeth (p. 40–45), the dedicatee of the oration. Kaau especially highlights their promotion of sciences and the founding of the academy. 
After Kaau’s oration, there is a shorter response byJohann Christian Hebenstreit, another member of the Academy of Sciences (beginning at p. 47 with a new title page). The structure is the same as in Kaau’s oration: A praise of medicine (p. 49–52) is followed by a eulogy on Tsarina Elisabeth (p. 52–55).

Such a portrait usually occupied an entire page of the paratext. It was accompanied by an inscription which identified the person portrayed in the image, or a short epigram which, in addition to identifying the author, could also praise him for his literary or scientific achievements (cf. the epigrams toAldrovandi's portraitorDescartes's portraitin this database). Such printed pages could be bound in the book, but it was also popular to collect them on their own.Of course, author portraits were not limited to the world of print, but were also painted on canvas. Like printed portraits, these paintings too could be accompanied by a Latin epigram, as is evidenced by the splendid portrait of the German astrologer Johann Carion by Lucas Cranach the Elder. In the left upper corner, two elegiac distichs in golden maiuscules on brown background give the impression of an inscription, reading:Si quibus est lectis mea cognita fama libellis,quos mea solerti cura labore dedit,ille ego sum Carion, coeli qui sydera tracto,clarus et astrorum nomen ab arte fero.""If my fame is known to some of you because they have read the books which my care offered with skilled work: I am that Carion who deals with the stars of the sky, and my name is famous because of the art of the stars [astrology].""The speaker of the epigram is the portrayed astrologer, presenting himself to those who see his likeness in the first person, a literary strategy often used already in ancient epigrammatic poetry. While the poem's central function is to identify Carion and his profession (notably, the painting does not feature astronomical instruments or books that could serve the same end), it does so by drawing on the topical connection between diligent literary production and fame (framed byfamain v. 1 andclarusin v. 4). This topos is reinforced by the object of Carion's scientific engagement, the stars, since the study of stars is often credited with lifting the astronomer-astrologer himself into the heavens (cf. e.g.Epigramma Ptolemaeo adscriptum).",Vredeveld 2013,Anonymus 7‎(← links),"Anonymus 7:Si quibus est lectis mea cognita fama libellis (author portrait), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Si_quibus_est_lectis_mea_cognita_fama_libellis_(author_portrait)(last revision: 21.02.2022).","Maybe, the use of the first person is inspired by ""Ptolemy's epigram"" in the AP?",IT,,IT,

Clüver had first-hand knowledge of Sicily, too, as he travelled the island himself, a fact that the author mentions both in the dedicatory letter and the preface.The description of Sicily itself is divided into two books: Book 1 first deals with the names of the island and its inhabitants (starting with the Cyclopes), the island’s location, shape and size. The author then proceeds to the description of the eastern and southern parts of Sicily, including a chapter on Aetna and its eruptions (pp. 97-114). Book 2 contains the description of the northern coast, the inland of Sicily and the adjacent islands, ending with a discussion of Ulysses' journey.

Hondius copied the information with very little modification and even cites the same passages from Bembo and Fazellus on the topic of the mountain.Indeed, for all intents and purposes, the works are the same on the topic of Aetna until page 56 (Libr. I, Cap. VIII. 2) ‘Aetnae Montis varia incendia’. Here Cluverius relies heavily on the ancient tradition for his list of eruptions at the volcano until he reaches eruption number 19 where he has another long quotation from Fazellus who witnessed the event himself.Cluverius then goes on to discuss the reasons for the eruptions in Cap. VIII. 3, where he recaps the ancient information and takes Servius’ account from the commentary of Aeneid book 3 as authoritative.Sections 4 and 5 of Cap. VIII deal briefly with the ‘templum Vulcani’ at Aetna and then with efforts to tell the future by dropping various items in the crater and final notes on where Aetna is mentioned in other classical sources.Altogether the work does not add a terrible amount to the picture of Aetna up to now in that it tends to look back for its information. However, it is useful to have as the source of Hondius’ work and for impressing the importance of Fazellus’ account of mount Aetna. Cluverius also wrote a description of Germany and of Italy in general which might be worth looking into for descriptions of other mountain ranges or individual peaks.WB",,Yes,IT,

The text is divided into four chapters each of which is, in turn, subdivided into several propositions. Twenty conclusions in which Zimmerman summarises his findings are placed at the very end of the treatise. In Chapter 1, Zimmerman focuses mainly on the place of the Sun within the universe; Chapter 2 is on the substance and composition of the Sun as a physical body, while Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 are devoted to the study of its movement and light respectively. Zimmerman first works through different theories on the structure of the universe. After denouncing theCopernicanassertionthat the Sun is in the centre of the universe, and rejectingTycho Brahe'stheory, he accepts the interpretation of his fellow JesuitGiovanni Battista Riccioliaccording to which only three planets, namely Venus, Mercury and Mars, revolve around the Sun. After that, he focuses on particular astronomical, mathematical, and optical features concerned with the Sun. Probably, the most interesting part of the treatise is on the problem of solar sunspots, which, in Zimmerman's opinion, are not an optical illusion caused by celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun. He states that the sunspots are real phenomena, which occur on the surface of the Sun and are caused by what he considers to be exhalations of the Sun. He goes on to say that the Sun is subject to change thus making the sunspots the most explicit evidence of this claim. In this respect, he is loyal to recent scientific discoveries that even though usually ascribed toGalileo Galileifound their most detailed justification inChristoph Scheiner'sRosa Ursina.

However, as evident from its table of contents, theFour Books of Synesian Dreamsis not a proper commentary since its author goes far beyond the framework established in the Neoplatonic treatise. Having based his discourse on numerous sources, which, apart from the traditional texts such as Artemidorus'Oneirocriticaand Macrobius'Somnium Scipionis, included medical, astrological, and philosophical works, Cardano sought to present a ""scientific"" encyclopedia of dreams. This aim determines the structure of the treatise as well as the way Cardano explores the subject in question: working through different types of dreams, the way they are perceived by a sleeping person, and, more importantly, their meaning and what they are expected to predict, Cardano reconstructs what he considers to be the true science of dreams.

After his return to Iceland, his mother, a witch of sorts, acquaints him with a demon from the moon. This demon describes to him, in a strictly scientific way, the conditions obtaining on the moon. Having read through this, Kepler wakes up.The text itself comprises only 28 pages. It is followed by a much more extensive autocommentary comprising 223 annotations (pp. 29–79), anAppendix selenographicaaddressed to the Jesuit Paul Guldin (pp. 80–96) and a translation of Plutarch'sDe facie in orbe lunae(obviously a major inspiration for theSomnium) with copious philological and astronomical notes, marginalia and an enumeration of the most important topics at the end (pp. 97–182).","Bialas; Grössing 1993, 317–438 (edition);Bungarten; Langner 2011(German translation);Bezzola Lambert 2002, 66–105;Aït-Touati 2011, 17-44;Glomski 2013","Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)Plutarchi De facie in orbe lunae‎(← links)Itinerarium exstaticum‎(← links)Dialogus inter terricolam et lunicolam‎(← links)Uranophilus caelestis peregrinus‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes:Somnium, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Somnium(last revision: 20.02.2023).","Mehrmals kommt Kepler auf die Mondberge (schon von Galileo Galilei als helle Punkte nahe der Schattengrenze erkannt) und ihre große Höhe zu sprechen.Zu Beginn seiner Erzählung  (S. 321) berichtet Duracotus, seine Mutter habe ihn von Kindheit an gelegentlich zum Kräutersammeln in humiliora iuga montis Heclae mitgenommen.Kepler argues for the movement of the earth by (a) having the lunar inhabitants believe that everything else is circling around the motionless moon, (b) have the lunar inhabitants (on the privolvan side) see how the earth spins around its axis on a daily basis, and (c) the lack of a stellar parallax (pointing to the immense distance between the earth and the fixed stars, which was vital for the Copernican theory to work), but different appearance of the planets and their movements as seen from the moon.Das Somnium scheint wissenschaftlich und literarisch einflussreich gewesen zu sein.Kepler in a letter to Bernegger (4.12.1632, GW vol. 18, 143) about hisSomnium:In mea commentatione totidem sunt problemata, quot lineae, solvenda partim astronomice, partim physice, partim historice.

This dream serves as the backdrop for the presentation of current issues in contemporary astronomy, which was being transformed by major new theories and observations at a rapid speed. The text was printed as an addition to a series of quodlibetical questions and their answers, which Froidmont as the elected president had given at theSaturnaliaof 1615, an academic festivity at the university of Leuven. In the preface, the author wittily describes hisSomniumas an attractive side dish with somniferous poppy (Ut autem pulpamentum etiam cenis istis esset, quod philosophos meos duceret, somniculoso pro eorum gustu papavere variavi, fol. a2r).The short satirical narrative is part of a tradition ofsomniumliterature at Leuven, to which it is explicitly connected: In Froidmont, the dream of the first-person narrator is triggered by theSomniumby Leuven professor Pieter Nanninck (Petrus Nannius), which the narrator was reading before falling asleep. In his dream, the narrator flies off on Pegasus’ back into the universe. He is accompanied by hisgenius, an expert in the field of cosmology. The text is shaped by the dynamic between the narrator (Froidmont’spersona) holding outdated views and the mocking genius correcting and ridiculing the narrator’s beliefs. Although the narrative framework of Froidmont’sSomniumis a satirical, Lucianic voyage through the universe (e.g. the narrator is most afraid to lose his beard when entering the sphere of fire, Pegasus’ need to pee arouses fear that he might extinguish a star with his urine), new astronomical theories and observations are presented seriously and truthfully.In terms of content, the Somnium focusses on the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian order of elements and the idea of solid planetary spheres, epicycles and eccentrics, all of which are rejected, and on the new observations by means of the telescope (i.a. the lunar mountains, the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter, the three-bodied Saturn) which can be witnessed by the narrator on his celestial voyage with his own eyes. In contrast, the question whether the universe is geocentric or heliocentric is left undecided in the text. Froidmont seems to treat Copernican ideas in a friendly and lighthearted manner, but he does not make the case for heliocentrism (rather, he focusses on the idea that other planets might be inhabited, too). In any case, Froidmont takes care not to declare himself a Copernican, creating distance to Copernican ideas in the marginal notes, but also by the literary form of theSomniumand the fact that Copernican ideas are only related by the ignorant narrator, not the expertgenius.In terms of form, for the major part of the text, the novel morphs into a dialogue, consisting of a back-and-forth conversation between the narrator and the genius. The longest descriptive part of theSomniumis the narrator's description of the appearance of the moon, sun, and the five planets. The framework of the dream is referenced at various points in the text, creating a sense of unity as well as of satirical entertainment.As Froidmont’s collection, including theSomnium, was reprinted in Leuven in 1665, the text seems to have been quite popular in the Leuven context in the 17th century.","Monchamp 1892, 34–44;De Smet 1996, 87–116;van Nouhuys 1998, 240–247;Pantin 2001;Glomski 2013;Pantin 2019","Froidmont, Libert‎(← links)Ant-Aristarchus‎(← links)Itinerarium exstaticum‎(← links)Dialogus inter terricolam et lunicolam‎(← links)Uranophilus caelestis peregrinus‎(← links)","Froidmont, Libert:Somnium sive peregrinatio caelestis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Somnium_sive_peregrinatio_caelestis(last revision: 05.02.2022).",,IT,Yes,IT,

While some works produced in this context provoked criticism by their compilatory nature (Maclean 2019, 78–79), such charges would be unfounded in the case of the presentExample of a New Chemical Investigation Concerning Volatile Salt from Plantsby the physician Georg Wolfgang Wedel, a particularly active member. The exact extension and intension of the termsal volatilementioned in the title is not clear, but it seems to cover ammonium bicarbonate  (NH4HCO3) and other components of hartshorn salt as well as substances with similar chemical properties. That Wedel assumessal volatileto comprise several cognate substances is made clear by his use of the term in the plural in the second half of his monograph. The work is affectionately dedicated to Wedel's close friend, the polyhistor and publicist Johannes Praetorius, and introduced by a preface to the reader, in which Wedel reflects, among other things, about the uses and abuses of chymistry.The treatise itself comprises 96 octavo or duodecimo pages (catalogues disagree on the format) and falls into ten chapters, which discuss not only the presence ofsal volatilein plants but provide a comprehensive account of this class of substances. The two initial chapters discuss the powers of plants in general, a well as methods of analyzing their components. After it has been demonstrated in ch. III that  ""volatile salt"" is contained in animals, the next chapter argues that it also must exist in plants. Chapter V discusses several methods of extracting this salt from plants. In ch. VI, various (esp. medical) uses of volatile plant salts are reviewed. Ch. VII deals with their microstructure, using the then-popular theory of minute pores in matter to explain their properties. Ch. VIII compares volatile salts with mercury. Ch. IX asks if they are actually contained in the bodies from which they are seemingly extracted or rather generated in the very act of extraction. In the final chapter, similarities and dissimilarities between different volatile salts are discussed.Wedel's argument takes pertinent chemical and natural-philosophical literature on the subject into account but also adduces experiences and experiments conducted by the author himself. Personal experience is valued highly (pp. 32–33):Ex cydoniis, opio et benzoe crystallos elegantes aliquoties nobis Vulcanus obtulit manifesto indicio illos salino et mercuriali deberi principio, et licet primo obtutu nihil minus inesse quam salinum talismodi appareat, ipsi tamen experientiae subscribendum.From quinces, opium, and benzoin, Vulcanus [the fire] several times presented me with elegant crystals, providing concrete evidence that they are the product of the salty and mercurial principle, and although at first sight, nothing seems to be contained less in things of this kind than the salty principle, one must nonetheless assent to experience.The passage also presents a good example of Wedel's overall clear, precise, and readable Latin. Admittedly, many other passages look more technical, as they feature Greek quotations (albeit always with a Latin translation), highly compressed citations such asD. D. Rolfincius chim. in art. form. redact. l.1.cap.16.pag.38(p. 6), technical terms, and alchemical symbols (often combined with endings in normal letters to indicate word-class and case). On the other hand, marginalia help readers not to lose track of the argument.The novel contents and presentational qualities of Wedel's book were obviously appreciated. Three more editions appeared in 1672, 1675, and 1682, a rare phenomenon in the case of a specialized monograph. Moreover, the work also appeared in vols. 4/5 (1673/74) of the firstdecuriaof theMiscellanea curiosa.","Maclean 2019, 84, 87","Specimen experimenti chimici novi de sale volatili plantarum(redirect page) ‎(← links)Wedel, Georg Wolfgang‎(← links)","Wedel, Georg Wolfgang:Specimen experimenti chimici novi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Specimen_experimenti_chimici_novi(last revision: 05.12.2021).",A near-perfect example of a monograph.

The booklet is exclusively dedicated to the errors ofAlbert von Curtz' monumental edition ofBrahe's observational data, theHistoria coelestisthat had been published two years earlier.After a letter of dedication to king Frederick III of Denmark, which in convoluted, difficult periods praises its addressee as a great patron of astronomy, who follows in the footsteps of his grandfather Frederick II (fol. a2r–a4v), the work itself falls in two parts. Some introductory remarks (pp. 1–12) are followed by a long list of errata (pp. 12–48).In the introduction, whose train of thought is at times hard to follow, Bartholin first declares his good intentions and asserts that he harbours no grudge against Curtz. His work exclusively aims at preventing damage that could result from misguided trust in wrong data (pp. 1–3). A few years ago, the Royal Library of Demark (founded in 1648 by Frederick III) acquired the autograph of Brahe's observational records (pp. 3–5). About the same time, Bartholin, who was contemplating an edition of Brahe'sopera omnia, learned that Curtz' was working at an edition of these records and hoped this might further his own plans. But he was disappointed, since the edition proved incomplete (years 1563–1581 and 1593 were missing) and full of errors (pp. 5–7). The copy in the Royal Library of Denmark – 10 volumes covering the entire years 1563–1601 – clearly is the autograph, whereas the library of Emperor Rudolf II only holds a transcript (from which, the reader has to infer, Curtz had to work) (pp. 7–10). Bartholin has checked the year 1582 of theHistoria coelestisagainst the original manuscript and found a great number of errors mainly attributable to seven categories: wrong dates, wrong figures, wrong symbols of planets and zodiacal signs, wrong indications of daytime, conflation of different observations, observations of one planet transferred to another, and failure to note circumstances of observations (pp. 10–12).After the general introduction, some 400–500 errors are listed as concisely as possible according to page and line. Often, the entry just states, for instance,lin. 40. pro 22 1/2 leg. 22.16 1/2(""l. 40: for 22 1/2 read 22.16 1/2"", p. 15). If necessary, a short explanation is added. In two cases (pp. 22–23), Bartholin resorts to diagrams to clarify Brahe's original intention.Bartholin's work presents an interesting example of painstaking philology in the service of science. Although patriotic pride clearly is one of his motives, he never lapses into polemics, but lets the facts speak for themselves. Unfortunately, his corrections were completely ignored when theHistoria coelestiswas re-edited in 1672. Brahe's observational notes were satisfactorily published only in the early 20th century by John Luis Emil Dreyer in tomes 10–13 of hisTychonis Brahe Dani opera omnia(Dreyer 1913–1928).",,"Historia coelestis‎(← links)Bartholin, Rasmus‎(← links)","Bartholin, Rasmus:Specimen recognitionis nuper editarum Observationum astronomicarum Tychonis Brahe, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Specimen_recognitionis_nuper_editarum_Observationum_astronomicarum_Tychonis_Brahe(last revision: 30.06.2021).",RECENSIO,MK,Yes,MK,

A member of a rich and respected family based in Zadar in modern Croatia, Grisogono studied and later for some years taught at the University of Padua. These years are reflected in the two introductory texts that precede theSpeculum astronomicum. In a laudatory epistle composed by Marco Antonio Contarini, one of Grisogono’s students at Padua, Grisogono is declared the wisest philosopher and the champion of astrology. The second document is theOratio in Academia Patavina habita. All the laudatory character of the publication is supported by several short poems placed at the end of the book in which Grisogono's contemporaries praise his work.The main body of the book is divided into two  parts: while part 1 mostly deals with natural philosophy and advocates astrology as the most sublime discipline among natural sciences, part 2, originally conceived as a commentary on Euclid'sElements, provides a practical dimension and foundation for natural philosophical theories. The content of the treatise is based on standard sources, mostly of the Aristotelian tradition, with some references to Plato, Pythagoras and other authorities newly rediscovered at the time, which is supposed to demonstrate Grisogono's involvement in contemporary intellectual trends. In the end, as Grisogono states, Euclid's mathematical findings support the Aristotelian universe in which astrology remains the most honourable field of natural philosophical investigation.",Girardi-Karšulin; Perić; Čepulić 2007,"Grisogono, Federico‎(← links)De fluxu et refluxu maris‎(← links)Oratio in Academia Patavina habita‎(← links)","Grisogono, Federico:Speculum astronomicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Speculum_astronomicum(last revision: 04.02.2022).",I (MK) do not understand quid sibi velit hic commentarius which after endless preliminaria ends with the discussion of Euclid's very first theorem.,OA,,OA,

First, Sacrobosco's university textbook of astronomy has become a schoolbook. Franco Burgersdijck prepared the text on the instigation of the States General of the Netherlands who had proclaimed that astronomy should be taught exclusively with the help of Sacrobosco in the schools. Second, the original text is not only enriched with manifold additions (especially from Christoph Clavius'In Sphaeram Ioannis de Sacrobosco commentarius), distinguished from the original text by italics but otherwise interwoven with it so closely as to form a new unity. Third, because he thought theSphaera'smedieval Latin unbearable (and presumably to harmonize it stylistically with his own additions), Burgersdijck completely rewrote Sacrobosco's text in classical Latin. Sacrobosco, for instance, reports Euclid's definition of the sphere as follows:Spera igitur sic ab Euclide describitur: Spera est transitus circumferentie dimidii circuli, quotiens fixa diametro quousque ad locum suum redeat circumducitur.In Burgersdijck's version, this becomes (p. 6):Sphaera definiente Euclide est figura, quae converso circa diametrum quiescentem semicirculo et in eundem locum rursus restituto, a quo coeperat moveri, continetur.The content, by contrast, remains by and large unchanged and unchallenged. For example, Sacrobosco's model of the universe with a stable earth in the centre is defended against alternative models (p. 26).Other than in older editions such as theOpusculum spericum cum commento et figuris, the four parts of Sacrobosco's treatise are subdivided into chapters.

A cosmological and geographical work of about 500 quarto pages, the book sets out to provide a new overview of the cosmos which takes into account the most recent scientific developments (Brahe,Kepler,Galilei,Kopernikus, and others). In the preface, the author names the progress in astronomy, particularly with the help of the telescope, as the first reason why a new introduction to geography/astronomy is needed. In a panegyrical dedicatory letter, Pietro Francesco Malaspina is depicted as a new Atlas who is presented with this newSphaera mundi. New astronomical discoveries and theories are described, but heliocentrism is rejected in the work (inter alia on religious grounds). Biancani defends the belief that God made the earth a perfect spherical world. Thus, the highest mountain would have its equivalent in the lowest depth of the ocean.The work itself falls into three parts: firstly, a short apparatus, in which the basics of trigonometry and the construction of different spheres and globes are explained (pp. 1–14); secondly, an explanation of important circles of the sphere, including the horizon, the meridian, the zodiac, and the major circles of latitude (pp. 15-54); and thirdly, the centrepiece (pp. 55–363), describing first the world and its elements (from earth to aether), then the celestial bodies (moon, sun, planets, comets, fixed stars, new stars). This part includes an appendix that deals among other things with sundials. Throughout the work, geometry is constantly employed; numerous diagrams illustrate the argument.The work has an alphabetical index at the front and is supplemented with three appendices at the end: a short introduction to geography (pp. 364–386), anApparatus ad mathematicas addicendas et promovendas(pp. 387–414), and a treatise on the echo which explains the acoustic phenomenon in analogy to optic reflection (pp. 415–443; with a short elegy at the end).The synthesis of contemporary astronomical knowledge achieved in theSphaera mundiwas held in high regard by the scientific community, as shown by at least three reprints up to 1653. (The lack of later reprints is probably due to the appearance of Giovanni Battista Riccioli's even more comprehensive and up-to-dateAlmagestum novumin 1651.) The work's most permanent legacy is the wordtelescopium(""telescope""), apparently coined in the 1610s in the Accademia dei Lincei but first used consistently in print by Biancani (McColley 1938).",,"Biancani, Giuseppe‎(← links)","Biancani, Giuseppe:Sphaera mundi, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Sphaera_mundi(last revision: 21.02.2022).","In his Sphaera Mundi, Blancanus defends the belief that God made the earth a perfect spherical world.

As Klein explains in bilingual letter to the reader (the column on the left is in Latin, the column on the right German), his system is based on the shape and position of limbs, feet and heads in particular. This letter is dated 6 April 1757 and is followed by a long list of men who have pre-ordered the book and thus supported its print.However, the book has been published posthumously by Johann Daniel Titius, then professor of mathematics at Wittenberg University. He explains his role in the publication process and also the circumstances of Klein’s death together with some words of praise on behalf of the deceased in a second letter to the reader dated 28 March 1759 and written in Latin throughout.

As is common with books of this kind (e.g. also in Linnaeus’s works), the descriptions are in the style of notes, i.e. rather single words than complete sentences. An entry of a species consists of its name and synonyms, a short description of feet, beak, and other important properties, and a section titledobservatio. in which Klein also refers to and at times discusses other literature. Moreover, Klein refers to its tables of engravings in the margins. These forty tables that are already mentioned on the title can be found at the end of the books featuring details of crucial properties (i.e. mostly feet and heads) of Klein’s taxa. It should be noted that Klein has also a different system for his taxonomy to Linnaeus, i.e. Klein’s taxa family, genus, and tribus are not equivalent to Linnaeus’s taxa.There is furthermore a glossary of bird names in Polish and Latin and vice versa, which does not contain all of Klein’s names, however.

Indeed, theAdversariaare one of the first works that ordered plants not according to medical properties or alphabet, but the authors base their taxonomy on externally visible properties, the shape of leaves in particular (Pavord 2005, 368). They grouped similar plants together and introduced different taxonomic levels such as genus and family.After an alphabetical index, the descriptions of plants start with thegenusofgramen(“grass”).

"Strabo,Guarinus Veronensis,Gregorius de Tipherno",Strabo de situ orbis,,1502,Venice,"Zani, Bartolomeo",16th century,"Translation, Encyclopedic work",Geography/Cartography,Strabo de situ orbis(e-rara.ch)Alternativ link:MDZ,823075,"Strabo's encyclopaedicGeographyin 17 books was among the very first major ancient Greek works to be printed in the West. As usual, this was not done in the Greek original, but in Latin translation. After the first manuscripts had reached Italy in the 1420s, two translations were produced by Guarino Veronese (the whole work) and Gregorius de Tipherno (books 11–17). In 1469, when both humanists were already dead for some years, a translation was published by Sweynheym and Pannartz at Rome (Gautier Dalché 2017, 368–369) under the aegis of Giovanni Andrea, bishop of Aleria, who took the description of Europe (books 1–10) from Guarino, the one of Africa and Asia (books 11–17) from Gregorius (fol. 2r; see below for his letter). The translation proved successful and was often reprinted. A Venetian editian from 1502 has been chosen for the present entry, since theeditio princepsis  not available online to date. As the copy features no title page and no other indications of date, place, and printer, the respective information has been taken over from internet sources.The edition starts from an index, which contains over 7000 geographical and other designations mentioned in theGeographyand is accompanied by a short letter, dated Venice, May 1499, from its compiler Antonio Mancinelli to the jurist Giustino Carosio. Three elegies and one epigram by a certain Christophorus Niger lack an obvious connection to theGeography. Like the index, they seem to postdate theeditio princeps. By contrast, the ensuing items presumably figured in the 1469 edition: a letter by Giovanni Andrea to Paul II (1464–71), which summarizes the genesis of the printed edition and inveighs against George of Trebizond, who seems to have criticized the endeavour; a letter by Guarino to Nicolaus V. (1447–55), in which he states that ""I tried to translate [Strabo] into Latin following the command of Your Holiness"" (Tuae Sanctitatis tractatus imperio Latinum vertere conatus sum); and an address by the same to the Venetian patrician Giacomo Antonio Marcello who helped him (financially, one supposes) to complete his translation after the demise of Nicolaus V.The translation features numerous marginalia, from which the index was compiled. Both translators try to stay close the Strabo's original (Gautier Dalché 2017, 369), but in doing so encounter massive problems in the form of textual corruption as well as grammatical and lexical difficulties. As a result, the meaning of the translation substantially differs from that of the Greek text in many places. Consider the following short example, where the geographical position and name of the city of Oreos in Euboea is discussed (Strabo 10.1.4; my English translation of the Greek; fol. 85v in Guarino's translation, reproduced with the original orthography and punctuation):κεῖται δ᾽ ὑπὸ τῷ Τελεθρίῳ ὄρει ἐν τῷ Δρυμῷ καλουμένῳ παρὰ τὸν Κάλλαντα ποταμὸν ἐπὶ πέτρας ὑψηλῆς, ὥστε τάχα καὶ διὰ τὸ τοὺς Ἐλλοπιεῖς ὀρείους εἶναι τοὺς προοικήσαντας ἐτέθη τοὔνομα τοῦτο τῇ πόλει.""It is situated at the foot of Mount Telethrios in the so-called Drymos [Woodland] on a high crag by the river Kallas; therefore, perhaps, it also was on account of its former inhabitants, the Ellopians, who were mountaineers, that this name was given to the city.""Eam vero sub thetrio monte Drymo iacere insulam. Sic enim vocatur iuxta callantem fluvium excelsa in petra. Itaque cum hellopienses montani essent: qui prius inhabitarant: hoc illi urbem esse forsan nomen impositum. Oros enim montem indicat.Into these lines, which roughly amount to 1/7000 of the total length of theGeography, no less than five changes have been introduced, intentionally or unwittingly, by Guarino, the scribe of his manuscript, and the printer: (1) At the end, an extra sentence (Oros enim montem indicat, ""Fororosmeans 'mountain'"") explains Strabo's etymology of the city's name, which is self-explaining in Greek. (2) While Strabo speaks in his own voice, Guarino seems to take his words as the continuation of a preceding indirect speech which reports a statement of the historian Theopompus. (3) The name of the mountain Telethrios has been corrupted. (4)insulammakes no sense. One would needin silva. Guarino presumably tried to clarify the meaning of Δρυμῷ by adding just that, but his words fell victim to a misprint. (5) The punctuation of the first part of the sentence obscures its syntax and meaning, making it impossible to understand that ""so-called"" (καλουμένῳ,sic enim vocatur) refers to Δρυμῷ. – Rendering antiquity's greatest work of descriptive geography into the common language of the West must have been a Herculean task, in which full success was out of reach from the outset.",,Strabo‎(← links)Guarinus Veronensis‎(← links)Gregorius de Tipherno‎(← links),"Strabo; Guarinus Veronensis; Gregorius de Tipherno:Strabo de situ orbis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Strabo_de_situ_orbis(last revision: 03.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Some commentators had acquired considerable authority of their own. A testimony to their prestige is the occasional emergence of supercommentaries such as the present one by Bartolomeo degli Emanuelli, a Roman professor of practical medicine. As he explains in his dedication to pope Clement VII (fol. A ii r–v), when expounding the first fen of book four of Avicenna'sCanon, a section dealing with fevers, to his students, he had to engage with the then famous commentary by Gentile da Foligno (†1348) on the same passage and found fault with some of Gentile's positions. His students were so thrilled by his respective remarks that they asked him to publish them. The result was the present booklet, whose c. 50 quarto pages are introduced by the aforementioned dedication and concluded by a list of errata. In his supercommentary, Bartolomeo alternatingly prints a passage from Gentile's commentary and his own, in most cases more extensive, comments on it. The corresponding passage of Avicenna's text is indicated by its incipit at best. Marginalia keep the reader oriented and specify Bartolomeo's sources.Bartolomeo's argument is learned, complex, and subtle. The great Greek and Arabic authorities such as Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen, Rhazes, or Averroes as well as the majorCanoncommentators are all mustered to bolster the discussion of various aspects of Gentile's exegesis. A summary of the single points of disagreement in terms of content is beyond the scope of the present description. The objections raised against Gentile's methodology and manner of presentation are manifold as well. For instance, Gentile is said to contradict himself:Quare igitur admiremur de Gentili in hoc si quis a nobis quaerat, dicam propterea quod visus est nobis illum quodammodo ignorasse semetipsum.(fol. B v, ""If therefore someone should ask me why I am astonished about Gentile at this point, I would answer, because he somehow seems to have become ignorant of himself."") He leaves his argument unfinished:Defecit autem Gentilis in hoc, quia non declaravit propriam caloris essentiam, quod facere debuit. Nam licet negaverit illum esse corpus et fuerit confessus esse qualitatem, non tamen propriam eius declaravit naturam, quod facere oportuit.(fol. B ii r, ""Gentile has been deficient in failing to explain the true nature of heat, as he should have done. For although he stated it was no body and asserted it was a quality, he nonetheless did not explain its true nature, as he should have done."") He is obscure:Quo[modo?]autem intellexerit Gentilis haec sua dicta, haud satis bene mihi compertum est.(fol. E r; ""But how Gentile meant this statement of his, I have not managed to find out to my satisfaction."") He constructs the exegetic tradition in a biased way to suit his ends:Non enim invenio illam quam dicit apud omnes concordiam.(fol. B iv r, ""For I cannot find that agreement among all of which he speaks."") However, Bartolomeo's criticism never turns into polemics. Throughout the book, he always treats his predecessor respectfully. The dedication sets the agenda: Bartolomeo takes care to point out that he has learned much from Gentile, is forced to dissent from him by his love of truth only, and does not want to attract any attacks from his fans. Where Gentile is right in his eyes, Bartolomeo expressedly gives him his due, as on fol. E iv r:In hac parte Gentilis videtur laudandus.(""In this part, Gentile seems to deserve praise."") Disagreement is often, as in the first example above, framed as astonishment, implying that Gentile only occasionally lapses from the high standards Bartolomeo has come to expect from him.As the extracts adduced, particularly the second, indicate – and a comparison with Bartolomeo's quotes from Gentile's text would confirm – the academic lecture style in Renaissance Rome did not differ greatly from the one in use in the early 14th century. The dedication written in decent, although not brilliant, classical Latin shows that Bartolomeo chose to keep this scholastic idiom in the published version not out of linguistic ineptitude, but on purpose. The cumbersome book title with its unelegant repetition ofdictaand of the highly unclassicalsuper, used in the meaning ofadandderespectively, even suggests that this kind of Latin (like the black letter font employed by the printer; cf.French 1985, 71) conveyed a sense of academic respectability and could work as an incentive to buy the book.",,"Avicenna‎(← links)Gentilis, de Fulgineo‎(← links)degli Emanuelli, Bartolomeo‎(← links)","Avicenna; Gentilis, de Fulgineo; degli Emanuelli, Bartolomeo:Super dicta Gentilis super definitione de febre data ab Avicenna, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Super_dicta_Gentilis_super_definitione_de_febre_data_ab_Avicenna(last revision: 26.12.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

(Linné himself had used his system in 1753 for plants in hisSpecies plantarum, but he did not apply it to the animal kingdom before the tenth edition of hisSystema Naturaein 1758). The opening dedication to Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden, and the imprimatur granted by Linné on behalf of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala are in Swedish only, but for the rest, Clerck produced a bilingual text in Swedish and Latin, presumably catering to a Swedish readership primarily interested in the local fauna on the one hand and to members of the internationalres publica litterariaperhaps more interested in his systemic innovation on the other.In his preface to the reader, Clerck pays tribute to Linné's teaching which inspired his work, tells of his difficulties to obtain copies of other books on spiders and provides some extracts from them because of their rarity, speaks about the names given by him to the various species (which are not cast in stone), his problems in telling the differences between species apart from internal variation and sexual dimorphism, concedes that his pictures are not first-rate (but in fact, they are), and asks readers to send him specimens found by them. The work itself falls into two parts: In part one (pp. 1–15), spiders are described in general terms, including an introduction to the anatomical terminology used by Clerck. In the second part (pp. 15–152), the spiders found in Sweden are subdivided into twoagmina(literally ""armies""), namely air- and water-spiders. The former comprise two classes, net-spiders and jumping spiders, either of which falls into three genera, which comprise more than 60 species between them. Everyagmen, class, genre, and species is carefully and graphically described. Clerck narrates how he found and nurtured his spiders, how they died, if he managed to obtain a male and a female, and if offspring was produced. The single parts of the spiders' bodies, obviously observed with a microscope, are described precisely and in great detail, as also are the eggs, if possible. At the end, the reader finds an index of spider names and the tables of illustrations.As far as someone who has no Swedish can tell, the Latin translation is accurate. With some effort, a reader speaking any Germanic language is by and large able to follow the Swedish text with its help. In fact, it is not even sure that the Swedish version was composed first and subsequently latinized by Clerck, an assumption which would rest solely on its more prominent presentation (see below). In fact, Clerck could as well have written the work in Latin and translated it into Swedish after. In any case, the layout is peculiar. In most bilingual 18th century works of natural history, the Latin and vernacular versions are printed in two facing columns (cf., for instance, Swammerdam'sBiblia naturaeor  Rösel von Rosenhof'sHistoria naturalis ranarum nostratium). In the present case, by contrast, the Swedish and the Latin text are assigned the upper and lower part of a page respectively. Moreover, the latter is presented in smaller font. Why this was done – national pride? priority given to the local market? – is hard to tell.",,"Clerck, Carl‎(← links)","Clerck, Carl:Svenska spindlar / Aranei Suecici, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Svenska_spindlar_/_Aranei_Suecici(last revision: 16.08.2021).",Shows how the 'report mode' can intrude into genres that seemingly have nothing to do with it.

Anonymus 15,"Symbolum Oenipontanum. Ynsbrugger Warzaichen.

At the cross-section of sensationalism andmemento mori,the print also presents some information on Gschaidter as a medical case. Thus, several discourses merge in this popularising format: the discourse of wonder, the baroque vanitas discourse and the medical discourse. The broadsheet is a German publication with some Latin elements: a popular moralizing dictum adorning the decorative border of the engraving (fac ea, quae moriens facta fuisse velis, ""do the things that you want done when you die"") and a Latin poem between the engraving and the German text. While the name of the engraverAndreas Spänglercan be found in the image, the author(s) of the German and Latin texts is (are) not named.The anonymous Latin poem consists of four elegiac couplets distributed in two columns and follows a strict form. Each couplet expresses one thought: the first couplet describes the image, the second is dedicated to the causes of the carpenter's condition, the third highlights the prolonged duration of this state and the fourth admonishes the reader to think of his own death. While the outer couplets (1+4) address the viewer (aspectas,cerne), the carpenter is the subject of the inner couplets (2+3). In addition, the inner couplets are structured by the antithesis ofnescit-scit: the carpenter does not know the causes of his state, but he is aware of the long duration of his weakness. In general, the poem abounds in antithesis. For example the first line describes the deformed carpenter assana in malesano corpore mens(""a sane mind in an ill body""), playing on Juvenal's famousmens sana in corpore sano(Satires10.356). In the closing couplet, the antithesis is merged into an oxymoron, describing the carpenter's body asvivum cadaver(""a living corpse"").The bimedial and bilingual presentation suggests that the broadsheet (like many others) was expected to find interested readers and viewers of different social standing and learning. However, it is the German, not the Latin text that offers more information. While the readers learn from the Latin poem that Gschaidter's arms and legs are crooked, that he has been bedridden for 15 years due to unknown causes and that all medical treatments have failed, they get the details from the German prose paragraph: the carpenter's name is Wolffgang Gschaidter, he is almost 50 years old and has a wife, a son and two daughters. 16 years ago, Gschaidter, who had been in good health, suddenly fell ill with severe headache and toothache. Three days later, the pain spread first to his left arm and back, then to all limbs, deforming and paralyzing them in the process. Gschaidter spent the last 15 years being unable to move any part of his body except his eyes and his tongue.The distribution of information suggests that in the case of this broadsheet, the Latin elements serve rather as ornaments. Perhaps, they are intended to incite the interest of learned readers in the case or to give the publication a learned aura (for a broadsheet entirely in Latin, see theBroadsheet on Conjoint Twinsin this database).",Mürner; Schönwiese 2007(includes the Latin text of the poem with a German translation and a short commentary),Anonymus 15‎(← links)Der kranck oder krumme Tischler zu Ynsprugg(redirect page) ‎(← links),"Anonymus 15:Symbolum Oenipontanum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Symbolum_Oenipontanum(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,,Yes,IT,

His monograph on human anatomy became an important textbook for students as well as his colleagues in the second half of the 17th century. It describes the body parts in detail as a help for medical students otherwise unable to understand the dissections, as they were performed at Italian universities at the time. Accordingly, as the preface states, Vesling depicts the body in the order of a dissection: first the skin, then bones and muscels of the abdomen, intestines, kidneys, the urinal tract, male and female genitals, fetus, the thorax, heart and lung, vocal organs, shoulders and back, the bones and muscels of the head, the brain, the eyes and ears and, last not least, bones, muscles, veins, arteries and nerves of the extremeties.Vesling proclaims to not aim to engage in philosophical disputes and controversies about the human anatomy and strives to present his knowledge in a sober tone, even though he does clearly present his own opinion in controversial topics, as e.g. the relationship between brain marrow, spiritus and the mind when describing the brain. Vesling already described what would later be known as the ""Circle of Willis"" (cf.Thomas Willis).
Vesling's work was soon complemented by a set of detailed images, displaying the different body parts as explained in the text. These Tabulae were also printed separately, e.g. in Padua in 1709 (Filippo Masieri, Tavole anatomiche del Veslingio). Vesling's work saw several editions, it was printed in Frankfurt already in 1641, augmented and reprinted in Padua in 1647, 1651 and 1677, in Amsterdam 1649, 1659 and 1666.

They usually forget to mention that Galilei's choice excluded the vast majority of potential readers outside Italy and that the work's Europe-wide influence crucially depended on a translation into Latin. Such a translation was published three years after the original by the Austrian scholar and scientist Matthias Bernegger in Strasbourg and reprinted several times until the end of the century in England and the Netherlands. That Bernegger was clearly aware of the function his translation had to fulfil is evident from a passage at the beginning of his introductory address to the benevolent reader in which he implies to have undertaken the work… ut, quem Hetrusce loquentem pauci intelligerent, Latine conversum cum orbe cultiori doctiorique universo communicarem(""in order to share the book, intelligible to few while speaking in the Tuscan tongue, with the entire more cultivated and educated world in Latin translation""). However, it is not clear how well Bernegger's translation actually sold. The modest number of copies extant today should probably be a warning against overestimating its success (Pantin 1996, 57–58). On the other hand, the translation was republished several times over the 17th century (cf.Epitaphium Galilaei).Bernegger faithfully renders Galileo's four-day discussion, set in Venice, of the respective merits of the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic and the Copernican cosmology between the forward-thinking scientist Filippo Salviati, the staunch Aristotelian Simplicio (apparently not a real person) and the interested citizen Giovanni Francesco Sagredo into fluent, easily readable Latin. In doing so, he makes no stylistic difference between the three speakers; even Simplicio speaks humanist Latin and his language hardly shows any traces of scholasticism. Besides the body text, the Latin translation also comprises the original's marginalia, the imprimaturs, Galilei's dedication to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, his addressAl discreto lettoreand the extensive subject index at the end. In addition, Galilei's work is preceded by Bernegger's aforementioned address to the reader, in which the translator not only avers his insufficient knowledge of Italian and the hurry in which the translation was done, but also invents a ficticious story, intended to shield Galilei against possible allegations of having played an active role in the translation, of how he got hold of a copy of theDialogo(Kremer 2014, 115–118). This is followed by a portrait of Galilei. After the dialogue, one finds another short address by Bernegger to the reader introducing two additional pieces which uphold the possibility to reconcile the results of modern astronomy with Scripture on the basis of the argument that the latter simply uses everyday speech in order to be understandable to everyone: an extract from Johannes Kepler'sAstronomia novaand a translation of an Italian letter (Naples 1615) by the Carmelite father and astronomer Paolo Antonio Foscarini. After the subject index, the Latin version is concluded by a short excerpt from ps.-Plutarch'sDe placitis philosophorumabout those ancient thinkers who opted for a moving earth and a list of errata.The most glaring deviation of Bernegger's translation from the original is its new title: In contrast to the cautious original title (preserved in a shortened form on the frontispiece),Systema cosmicumclearly implies that there is only one true world system. The additional paratexts leave no room for doubt that this is the Copernican one. However, while the Latin version is as a whole more outspoken than the original in scientific terms, this is not coupled with any anti-catholic propaganda. Although Bernegger was a protestant whose family had been driven from its hometown in Upper Austria on account of their faith, he (and his publishers) clearly wanted the translation to appeal to readers of all confessions.",,"De motu‎(← links)Galilei, Galileo‎(← links)Bernegger, Matthias‎(← links)Epitaphium Galilaei‎(← links)","Galilei, Galileo; Bernegger, Matthias:Systema cosmicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Systema_cosmicum(last revision: 20.07.2023).",,MK,Yes,MK,

After the work had been published for the first time in 1735, it was reworked and re-edited multiple times in expanding editions (12 editions until 1768). The first edition consisted of seven double folio pages. From the second to nineth edition, the work grew moderately from 80 to a little over 200 quarto or octavo pages. It exploded in the tenth (1758), which comprises two volumes and more than 1350 octavo pages. This edition is noteworthy also for being the first to consistently use Linné's binomial nomenclature (each species is named by a collocation of two words, the first of which denotes the genus, the second the species itself), which is used without exception in modern zoology and botany. For this reason, it has been selected for presentation here.The tenth edition opens with an instructive overview of the editions published so far and with anIntroitus, a hymnic declaration of faith in the beauty of God's creation and of confidence in scientific progress. The purpose of human life is to contemplate and examine nature (intueri naturam). The same thought is elaborated in the next chapter, which is titledImperium naturaeand provides a panorama of the cosmos which starts with God, whose traces can be detected in nature, and ends with science. The first volume deals with the animal kingdom, divided into six classes: mammals (including humans), birds, amphibia (amphibians and reptiles), fish, insecta (arthropods), and vermes (other invertebrate species). The second volume on the plant kingdom is a sort of expanded edition to theSpecies plantarumfrom 1753, structured along Linné's sexual system.

Based on his observations at the Observatoire Royal at Paris, one of the most modern and best-equipped of its times, they represent a very advanced stage in the tradition of astronomical tables.The work features two dedications: one, in the form of a one-pageelogium, to Louis XIV, the other, in letter format, to the cleric and statesman Jean-Paul Bignon, the president of the French Academy of Sciences at the time. In this letter, La Hire explains some fundamental traits of his work, the most important of which is his eschewal of any specific theory of the Universe or the solar system. In a passage on the second page, he attributes the imprecisions by which theTabulae Rudolphinaeare marred to the fact thatKeplerfounded them on hisown theory(Kepleri ipsius hypothesis), that is, he interpolated data found on the basis of his three laws of planetary motion. In Kepler's day, there was no other choice, as astronomical instruments were too imprecise to rely exclusively on observations made with their help. La Hire's own, purely phenomenological approach has been made possible by the advanced observational instruments at his disposal, partly developed by himself, partly taken over from others. A decisive role in this context was played by the exact timekeeping enabled by thependulum clockinvented byHuygenswho is explicitly credited for this achievement in the dedicatory letter. A different prominent name, however is notably absent:Isaac Newtonand his revolutionary i.a. astronomical workPrincipia mathematica(1687) which is in agreement with La Hire's reservations about infinitesimal calculus (CDoSB, vol. 7., 577).As customary in astronomical table works, La Hire's book falls in two parts: The tables themselves are preceded by an introduction of 102 pages. The latter contains 22praecepta(""instructions""), many of which are subdivided intoproblemata,demonstrationesand so on; they also feature numerous exemplary calculations. A number of sections with other titles provide additional information on various aspects, much of which is not precisely related to the tables. This is true, for instance, of descriptions of instruments like the micrometer (pp. 65–71). The respective passages are of stylistic interest, because in them, La Hire cannot rely on the established vocabulary of astronomy. He has to come up with his own answers to the challenge of describing and explaining objects which most of his readers have never seen and handled. In doing so, he emerges as an inventive and meticulous writer.The 55 tables fill 80 separately paginated pages. The first ten items deal with practical questions of observation, for instance the relation between degrees of longititude and time (t. 1–2), the equation of time (t. 3), or refraction (t. 5). The rest (t. 11–55) is devoted to the sun, the moon, and the other planets. In addition to the instructions provided in the introductory part, some tables are further elucidated in a short paragraph titledususor the like on the bottom of the respective page.The corrections of misprints at the end mostly regard the figures, which are all-important in this kind of writing. The volume is concluded by a number of plates (which unfortunately are only partly visible in the digital copy).The work had a long gestation, as the tables concerned with the practicalities of observation, the sun, and the moon first were published as early as 1687. A second edition appeared posthumously in 1727, a French translation by La Hire himself in 1735. In addition to these Parisian editions, a drastically shortened version comprising only part of the tables plus a few pages of additional material came out in 1722 at Ingolstadt, a German version in 1725 and 1745 at Nuremberg.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 7, 577Souchay 2013, 96–97","La Hire, Philippe de‎(← links)","La Hire, Philippe de:Tabulae astronomicae Ludovici magni iussu et munificentia exaratae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tabulae_astronomicae_Ludovici_magni_iussu_et_munificentia_exaratae(last revision: 01.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Since antiquity, it had been an auxiliary science to history. In early modern times, when the past became of greater concern to the learned than ever before, increasing attention was paid to chronology as well, and numerous conflicting reconstructions of the chronological sequence of major historical events were developed. Keeping track with them as well as synchronising the many different strands of history became a challenge in its own right. Chronological tables – a form dating back to the second book of Eusebius'Chronicon(4th century AD) – promised a solution to such problems. For this reason, they enjoyed considerable popularity.Protestant Germany was a hotspot of chronological research in the 16th century. The presentChronological Tables,  compiled by a Lutheran pastor, were dedicated to the three young sons of his territorial lord John I, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken. The letter of dedication extols the benefits of history and explains that chronology, together with geography, provides orientation in the past. The work itself is presented as a pure compilation, based in particular on the work of Melanchthon, Johann Funck, and David Chytraeus, three major chronographers of the preceding generation. The latter'sChronologia historiae Herodoti et Thucydidis, cui adiecta est series temporum mundi(1585) in fact serves as a point of reference throughout.Candidus' account is divided into three parts, the first and last of which consist almost entirely of tables, while the second features a number of tables followed by some running text. (This does not become clear from the somewhat confused announcement on the title page.) Part one presents a concise chronological overview of world history in general (fol. b r–c iii v). Part two provides a comparison between the systems of different Protestant chronographers for the timespan from the Creation to the birth of Christ, among them Chytraeus, Luther,Reinhold, Funck,Mercatorand others. This is followed by notes on the peculiarities of the different reconstructions and (strangely) rounded off by a number of epigrams in praise of Candidus' work (fol. c iv r–e iv v). The last section (which is separately paginated, pp. 1–137) contains a detailed overview of world history. As an appendix to the chronographical account, Candidus publishes a series of epigrams on historical events (pp. 143–72).By virtue of this structure, theChronological Tablesmanage to cater to satisfy a number of needs on comparatively small space: They provide a rough guide to world chronology, a world chronicle and an overview of the chronological research of the last decades. The latter is parochially restricted to Protestant Germany, though.Scaliger'sDe emendatione temporum, for instance, is not even mentioned. It is therefore understandable that the work enjoyed a certain success.

Regiomontanus chooses 100,000 as radius (sinus totus) of the defining circles in order to avoid fractions in the tables of trigonometric functions. The so-calledtabula fecunda(""fruitful table"") on fol. 30r gives the tangent (whose value is called simplynumerus) for each degree from 0° to 90°. 
Most tables, however, indicate the positions of the zodiacal signs in degrees and minutes for a given time and place. This reflects an important purpose of the collection, namely the computation of astrological houses and their borders for the generation of horoscopes, an aspect highlighted already in the title (in nativitatibus multum utiles).As an average page contains some 200 figures, the calculations involved must have been a Herculean task. The terminology, abbreviations and symbols used are technical and hard to understand for the non-expert in early modern astronomy.On the last page, the printer has proudly placed his coat of arms along with a short epigram.","Zinner 1968, 147-151Merzbach; Boyer 2011, 248Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 11, 350","Regiomontanus, Johannes‎(← links)","Regiomontanus, Johannes:Tabulae directionum profectionumque, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tabulae_directionum_profectionumque(last revision: 22.02.2022).",Digital Source is very slow,"MK, FB",Yes,"MK, FB",

Under Johannes Kepler's auspices and partly based on his work in theTabulae RudolphinaeandChilias logarithmorum, his son in law Jacob Bartsch had calculated and published tables of logarithms that were tailored for the astronomical calculations in theTabulae Rudolphinae. In fact, some exemplars of theTabulaecontain an appendix by Bartsch wherein he explains basic astronomical calculations for beginners, but also promotes his more comprehensive and accurate tables in the present work. In fact, it seems that the major part of this book was produced solely by Bartsch.The book is structured as follows: After the preface by the editor Eisenschmid, Bartsch briefly explains the tables and their improvements compared to Kepler's. He then presents some examples and concludes this first part with a chapter on trigonometry. The second part - comprising some 260 pages out of 310 - consists of logarithmic tables whose structure and topics closely follow those in theTabulae Rudolphinae.In contrast to theTabulae Rudolphinaeand because of Kepler's and Bartsch's death in 1630 and 1633 respectively, only few copies seem to have been sold and the work had become virtually unobtainable by the end of the century. (In fact, no copy seems to be extant today.) In 1700, Johann Caspar Eisenschmid, who had got hold of one copy, produced a new edition, in which he corrected many of the first edition's typos (for the grave problems caused by misprints in works of this kind, seeTycho Brahe's andAlbert von Curtz'sHistoria coelestis).

HisTabulaeare meant to rival Kepler’sTabulae Rudolphinaeand presuppose motions of planets based on circular orbits. As proudly announced in the title and explained towards the end of the dedication, Lansbergen thinks his are the first and only tables which are calculated so exactly as to permit correct calculations of the position of the stars for all times to come. However, Kepler's predictions of planetary motions proved to be more accurate and therefore were more successful.The work contains an engraved title pagee that features famous astronomers – among them Ptolemy, Al-Battani, Copernicus, Tycho and Lansbergen himself, but not Kepler – and a heliocentric model of the world. Then follows a dedicatory letter to Lansbergen’s patrons from Zeeland. In this letter, he states that he has worked on theTabulaefor about 44 years and highlights the difficulties of doing astronomical research. Moreover, he gives a doxography of earlier research starting in antiquity up to his own time, including Kepler’sTabulae Rudolphinaeagainst which he polemicizes. After the dedicatory letter, there is a portrait of the author at the age of 66 together with a poem of six verses by Daniel Heinsius. Like in Horatius'Epodes14 and 15, Heinsius uses a distich composed of a hexameter and an iambic dimeter. Furthermore, Heinsius contributed a Greek and another Latin poem. After a letter to the reader, a quite long poem comprising seven pages on the history of astronomy from antiquity to the present time byMartinus Hortensiusfollows. The arch is stretched from Hipparchus to Ptolemy, al-Battani,Peuerbach,RegiomontanusuntilCopernicusgave the basis for a new astronomy. Although mentioningErasmus Reinhold'sPrutenicae tabulaeand theTabulae Rudolphinae, Lansbergen's tables are presented as the long-awaited culmination of astronomy (Remmert 2011, 183).On pages 25–79, the main text begins with 40 explanations of how to calculate with the help of Lansbergen’s astronomical tables (Praecepta calculi motuum coelestium ex tabulis).

They contain the mean and apparent motions of 38 reference stars for the years from 1750 to 1850. The ""reduction"" mentioned in the title is a mathematical correction procedure in order to get rid of three main systematic error sources in observations: the aberration of light (an effect displacing the apparent position of stars towards the direction of Earth's motion in the orbit, due to the finite speed of light), the nutation (the nodding of the Earth caused by the Moon's tidal forces) and the Earth's precession (the gyroscopic movement of its axis).The book's table of contents reveals its clear internal structure: A general introduction (pp. I–XXIII) discusses phenomena like precession, ""proper motion"" of stars (a very slow but gradual change of apparent positions of nearby stars caused by a relative change of the position of the solar system and the respective star), nutation and aberration in terms of mathematical astronomy. Numbered formulas of spherical trigonometry containing constants to be found in the tables are presented. Various problems (e.g. how to compute the rectascension and declination of a star at a given time) are then solved with the help of these formulas. 
Before the tables themselves, one finds a section titledExplicationes et usus tabularum, which contains additional explanations for each of the 15 tables individually (pp. XXIV–LXIII). Most of these tables contain the values for the correction of the described phenomena, the constants being mostly displayed in terms of their logarithms (for simpler calculation).  The heart of theTabulae Regiomontanaeis table X which bears the coordinates of the 38 stars and spans over 400 pages.AsAubin 2017argues, Bessel uses mathematics as an additional ""instrument"" of the astronomer, comparable to a new precise telescope. This was to become a new standard in astronomy as measurements with an error below one arcsecond became necessary. Bessel indeed managed to attain this degree of precision when he measured the parallax of 61 Cygni in 1837 and 1838, which enabled him to determine the distance of a star from the Earth for the first time.TheTabulae Regiomontanaeserved as ephemerides until 1850. Their clear and technical language made them comprehensible among specialists. Generally speaking, many astronomical terms would remain in Latin (likeaequinoctium,variatio saecularis,variatio annua, cf.Krueger 1882) or be clearly derived from the respective Latin expressions (Declination,Praecession) in vernacular texts for a long time to come.","Aubin 2017Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 2, 97-102, esp. 99, 100.",,"Bessel, Friedrich Wilhelm:Tabulae Regiomontanae reductionum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tabulae_Regiomontanae_reductionum(last revision: 14.02.2022).",,MK,Yes,FB,

The present 1587 edition is the earliest available online. Making use of preliminary work byJohannes Regiomontanus, the tables are ultimately based on two 14th century redactions of theAlphonsine Tables(North 2013, 469), from one of which they borrowed their obscure title, which may or may not mean something likeAstronomical Tables Convenient to Use.The structure of theTabulae resolutae astronomicaecorresponds to a standard which gained acceptance in works of this kind from the late 15th century: They fall into two parts, as the tables themselves are introduced by detailed instructions for the reader. In the present case, the introductory information comprises a short overview of the elementary mathematical techniques needed (pp. 1–9) and a series of 32propositiones(""problems"" or ""exercises""), which by means of numerical examples explain how various tasks can be performed with the help of the tables (pp. 9–48).What makes Schöner's work special is the information it contains about its own intended use. This use is hinted at in the title, where ""prescriptions transmitted in works of planetary theory"" are mentioned, and detailed in the introductory paratexts. The 1587 edition contains three of the latter (not counting a short elegy by Melanchthon), the first of which has been added afterwards for this very edition: its editor, the Wittenberg rector Johannes Hagen, dedicates it to the Duke of Saxony (apparently Christian I, although no name is given). The second paratext is a letter, dated 1536, by Melanchthon to Schöner, in which he praises his addressee as the glory of the astronomy practiced at Nuremberg. In the third, dated to the same year, Schöner himself dedicates the first edition to the city council of Nuremberg. The interesting assertion made in all three paratexts is that Schöner's tables are utilized in the formal teaching of  planetary theory. On the third page of his letter, Melanchthon states:Quod igitur hoc tempore edidisti et expoliisti tua diligentia atque industria Tabulas resolutas, egregiam operam navasti, quia in scholis praecipue opus est his tabulis, cum theoricas, ut vocant, motuum colestium ad usum transferant et monstrent facilem et compendiariam rationem computandi motus coelestes.So you now have done something exceedingly helpful in publishing and polishing the Resolved Tables by your diligence and assiduity, because these tables are much needed, particularly in class, because they put the so-called theorical reflections about the celestial movements into practice and indicate an easy shortcut towards their calculation.It transpires from this that works of planetary theory like Georg von Peuerbach'sTheoricae novae planetarumwere not studied by themselves but in combination with table works like Schöner's. Apparently, the theory learned by the students immediately was employed on the calculation of concrete examples with the help of tables. This demonstration of the practical relevance of the subject presumably made it more attractive and enhanced the pupils' motivation. Schöner himself briefly repeats Melanchthon's point by declaring  his work to be useful inscholis nostris(""our educational institutions"", which in this context must mean Lutheran universities). Fifty years later, nothing has changed in this respect, as Hagen still states on the next-to-last page of his dedication that the tables are much needed in the universities (quibus in academiis praecipue opus est.)",,"Schöner, Johannes‎(← links)","Schöner, Johannes:Tabulae resolutae astronomicae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tabulae_resolutae_astronomicae(last revision: 25.07.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

It opens with two dedications to Ferdinand II by Brahe’s heirs and Kepler himself, followed by a panegyricidyllionon the intricate frontispiece byJohann Baptist Hebenstreit. Then comes Kepler’s preface to the general reader wherein Kepler contextualises the work in the long history of the ""mother"" astrology and her ""now grown-up daughter"" astronomy and their protagonists. He closes with an outline of the long genesis of the work, acknowledges the major contributions of Tycho Brahe, notes his own contributions. The preface is followed by a comprehensive 120 pp. guide on how to use thetabulaeand a shortsportula(""bonus feature"") on their use in astrology. In these parts a quick reading and finding text passages is supported by helpful printed marginal notes.Thetabulaeproper fall in four parts: first, general mathematical foundations, mainly in the form of tables of trigonometric functions and logarithms - Kepler’s indespensable new tool in order to compute stellar positions; second, a catalogue of the positions of the sun and the planets at different times; third, a catalogue of eclipses and conjunctions; and forth, a catalogue of some 1000 fixed stars and their positions. But rather than listing planetary and solar positions for all dates, theTabulae Rudolphinaeare made for users with sufficient mathematical and astronomical knowledge: It provides only the backbone of data from which any specific positions in the past or future could be attained by interpolation. Additionally, some exemplars contain an appendix byJacob Bartschwho supplements Kepler's often contorted and cryptic instructions on the use of thetabulaeby a simpler and clearer account.Kepler made every effort to publish thetabulae. In 1601 he got the task by emperor Rudolph II to finish what Tycho Brahe had begun. As Kepler tried to strengthen the physical basis for the tables (he published e.g. books on optics and his famousAstronomia nova, 1609, and others) the work lacked real progress. Almost finished he encounters Napier’slogarithmic tablesin 1617. He has to rewrite a big portion of the work: Apart from the logarithmic tables themselves, almost allpraecapta(manuals) had to be newly calculated and adapted. When Kepler had finished his manuscripts, empty promises concerning his payment and the starting Thirty Years’ War delayed the publication. Finally, with personal contributions for the printing costs, he is able to print theTabulae Rudolphinaefor the Frankfurter Herbstmesse in 1627. As a consequence of the tight printing schedule several parts (e.g. the frontispiece) are missing in the first edition. Also later editions vary considerably in their completeness: TheSportulaappeared only in 1629, Jacob Barsch’s appendix in 1632 and a world map not earlier than 1658, and many copies lack at least one of these parts (cf.Reichert 2014, pp. A2-A6).Considering the intended purely academic use of thetabulae, the 1000 copies of its first edition show the confidence of the printers in this revolutionary work, cf.Thorvaldsen 2010, p. 51. And although the tables proved to be the basis for astronomical calculations for the following some 100 years, the original did not sell too well. 
This was probably the reason for the first two additional publications, theSportulafor astrologers, andBartsch'sappendix, containing detailed instructions for beginners in astronomy.Follow-up publications seemed to consider the technically demanding (yet timesaving) logarithms as the biggest hurdle of theTabulae Rudolphinae. Two vernacular editions in French (1670) and English (1675) omitted them in favour of improved intelligibility. So did the female astronomerMaria Cunitzin her attempt to create a bilingual, more accessible counterpart to  Kepler's tables, theUrania propitia(1650).","Caspar et al. 1938ff., vol. 10Thorvaldsen 2010Reichert 2014","In astro-poecilo-pyrgium Keplerianum‎(← links)Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio‎(← links)Kepler, Johannes‎(← links)Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae‎(← links)Prutenicae tabulae‎(← links)Tabulae motuum coelestium perpetuae‎(← links)Urania propitia‎(← links)Tabulae manuales logarithmicae‎(← links)Tabulae astronomicae Ludovici magni iussu et munificentia exaratae‎(← links)","Kepler, Johannes:Tabulae Rudolphinae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tabulae_Rudolphinae(last revision: 12.10.2021).","KGW 10 (without translation); Ioannis Kepleri Tabulae Rudolphinae.

The earth, says Burnet, was created in a beautiful and regular shape, but was altered to its present ugliness during the flood, when the hollow earth cracked open to release the water under its surface (a calculation of the amount of water on earth led him to the conclusion that it was not sufficient to have caused the flood). After its publication, the work caused a plethora of reactions, mostly refutations, and set into motion a discussion that lasted until the mid 18th century.","Poole 2010, 55–63","Philosophia historica de montibus‎(← links)De situ telluris Paradisiacae et chiliasticae Burnetiano ad eclipticam recto‎(← links)Montes divinitatis testes‎(← links)Orologia‎(← links)Burnet, Thomas‎(← links)Physica harmonica‎(← links)De possibilitate physica longaevitatis patriarcharum antediluvianorum‎(← links)De monumento diluviano nuper in agro Bononiensi detecto‎(← links)Dissertatio philosophica examinans placita quaedam scripti recentissimi‎(← links)","Burnet, Thomas:Telluris theoria sacra, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Telluris_theoria_sacra(last revision: 22.11.2021).","In Telluris Theoria Sacra vertritt Burnet die Ansicht, die Welt sei von Gott zwar in schöner und regelmäßiger Form geschaffen worden, jedoch habe sich diese bei der Sintflut in ihre heutige hässliche Form verändert.

He did so in the presentEssay on the Causes of the Celestial Movements. Starting from Kepler's celestial mechanics and the Cartesian notion ofvortices, Leibniz arrived at the following model (cf.Aiton 1964andHoyer 1979for its mathematical side): A planet's movement consists of two (or three) components: first, the planet is carried along with the ether which circles the sun and whose speed increases proportionally with its proximity to the sun, just as water moves faster and faster as it approaches the center of a water vortex. Second, the planet has a movement of its own, which is calledparacentricusand results from two forces in turn – one that attracts it towards the sun and the centrifugal force caused by its circular motion. With the help a diagram of a planetary orbit (between pp. 84 and 85) and the version of the calculus developed by him (inter alia in hisNova methodus pro maximis et minimis), Leibniz shows that this model results in a movement conforming Kepler's three laws (as they came to be called later, cf. below).Between an opening section and a short conclusion (pp. 82–84, 96), the article is divided into 30 paragraphs so that Leibniz can orient the reader within his complex reasoning by way of cross-references.  Thematically, the text may be said to fall into three parts: (i) an introduction in which theexplanandum, the movement of the planets, is presented along with the idea of the ether as their carrier medium (up to §2), (ii) a main part in which Leibniz shows how one arrives at theexplanandumstarting from his presuppositions (§§ 3–26), and (iii) a final section, in which his results are synthesized in a description of a planet's elliptical orbit around the sun, including the changes of speed it undergoes on the way, and two desiderata are indicated: the explanation of the attraction exerted by the sun and of Kepler's third law (from § 27). The main part relies on the most advanced mathematics of its day and is correspondingly difficult. Moreover, the important termsvis centrifugaandtangenswere not properly clarified by Leibniz, which resulted in misunderstandings by contemporaries and recent scholars alike. (John Keilleven went as far as calling theTentamen""le morceau de Philosophie le plus incomprehensible qui ait jamais paru"", seeAiton 1964, 123.) By contrast, the language and reasoning of the first and last parts are comparatively easy to understand, as may be illustrated by the following passage (p. 82):Hic ergo invenit quemlibet planetarum primarium orbitam describere ellipticam, in cuius altero focorum sit sol, ea lege motus, ut radiis e sole ad planetam ductis areae semper abscindantur temporibus proportionales. Idem deprehendit plures planetas eiusdem systematis habere tempora periodica in sesquiplicata ratione distantiarum mediarum a sole, mire triumphaturus, si scivisset (quod praeclare Cassinus notavit) etiam Iovis et Saturni satellites easdem leges servare respectu suorum planetarum primariorum, quas isti erga solem.So he [Kepler] found out that each of the main planets describes an orbit shaped like an ellipse, in one of whose foci there is the sun, and that it does so according to the following law of motion: the areas cut off by lines drawn from the sun to the planet [at two different moments] are always proportional to the timeframes [between these two moments]. The same man also understood that several planets of the same [solar] system have orbital periods which are proportional to the 1.5th power of their mean distances from the sun. He would have been overjoyed had he known of the excellent discovery of Cassin that also the moons of Jupiter and Saturnus follow the same laws with regard to their main planets.These sentences are not only an example of the less technical variety of Leibniz' style, they also are of some interest for the history of astronomy at large: the seem to constitute the first passage in which Kepler's three laws are indeed described as ""laws"" (leges), mentioned all together and listed in the order that has become canonical today.",Aiton 1964Hoyer 1979,Hoyer 1979‎(← links)Aiton 1964‎(← links)Review of: Isaaci Nevvton Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica‎(← links),"Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm:Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tentamen_de_motuum_coelestium_causis(last revision: 16.08.2023).","On p. 82, L. implies that K. did not know that his 3rd law was also valid for the moons of Jupiter and Saturnus:Idem deprehendit, plures planetas ejusdem systematis habere tempora periodica in sesquiplicata ratione distantiarum mediarum a Sole, mire profecto triumphaturus, si scivisset,(quod praeclare Cassinus notavit) etiam Jovis & Saturni satellites easdem leges servare, respectu suorum planetarum primariorum, quas isti erga Solem.He is mistaken at least regarding the moons of Jupiter: see Kepler, see also Epitome (1618–21), vol. 2 (1620), 4.2.6, pp. 554–5 (KGW 7, 318–9) on the moons of Jupiter observing exactly the same law (proportione … sescupla proportionis intervallorum cuiusque a Iove: quae plane ipsissima est, qua utebantur supra sex planetae).",MK,Yes,MK,

According to the title page, these theses were defended in Basel by Johann Jakob von Brunn under the stewardship of Johann Georg Gross, a renowned Protestant theologian. The title page implies that the discussion was held in the form of adisputatio, which took place on 7 January 1611, therefore, after the feast of the Epiphany (6 January).The dissertation is divided into 25 remarks, which provide an overview of the problem, discuss the nature of the star and give a list of theologians that had discussed the issue. Although the text does not address the cosmological features of the star in depth, it touches upon two important natural philosophical ideas widely debated at the time. First, it suggests that the very fact that the Magi saw the star, recognised its significance and reached Bethlehem could only be explained through their Persian origin. Following a long-standing tradition, the author admits that the Magi were proficient in astrological/astronomical knowledge, thus it comes as no surprise that they decided to follow the star. It fits into the theory of the so-called great conjunctions, which was introduced in the Middle Ages and which interpreted significant political, religious and social events through powerful conjunctions of the planets. In this respect, the early seventeenth-century Reformed theologian seems to be following this controversial theory. Secondly, without going into much detail, though, Gross admits that it was a star, not any other sort of planetary or supernatural elements (comets, angels, the Holy Spirit were all seen as having been behind the appearance of the star). In this regard, Gross' short piece could be placed into a larger context of contemporary comet debates in the wake of the famous 1577 and 1618 comets. During the heated debates, which resulted in numerous texts on the matter, astronomers investigated the nature of various celestial bodies and, among other things, questioned the supernatural character of thestella magorum. This reveals that Gross was well aware of what was being discussed in contemporary cosmology.  
In sum, although at glance quite marginal, Gross' short dissertation/disputation summarises and, briefly in conformity with the genre, discusses some crucial points of late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century cosmology.",,"Gross, Johann Georg‎(← links)","Gross, Johann Georg; Brunn, Johann Jakob von:Theoremata philosophica de stella magorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Theoremata_philosophica_de_stella_magorum(last revision: 11.08.2021).",e-rara link does not work on 10 August 2021.

"Peuerbach, Georg von",Theoricae novae planetarum Georgii Purbachii astronomi celebratissimi,,[1472],[Nuremberg],[Regiomontanus],15th century since invention of printing,"Textbook, Other (see description), Oration",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Theoricae novae planetarum(MDZ),826785,"From the 12th to the 15th century, theTheorica planetarumoften, but without good reason ascribed to Gerard of Cremona (seePedersen 1981) was the leading textbook of planetary astronomy in the western world. Towards the end of the 15th century, it was replaced in this capacity by the present, more advanced work by the Viennese astronomer Georg von Peuerbach, pointedly titledNew(Novae)Theoricae of the Planets(on the expressiontheoricaesee below). The book originated from lectures given by Peuerbach in 1454 and transcribed, inter alia, by his star pupilJohannes Regiomontanus. Ten years after Peuerbach's death, when the art of printing had begun to spread, Regiomontanus installed his own printing shop at Nuremberg with the expressed goal of putting the new technology in the service of astronomy. One of the two first texts he printed were theTheoricae novae planetarum. Because some manuscripts are extant, one can verify that he followed them quite faithfully. The only important change concerns a section on trepidation (a theory explaining a putative variation in the rate of the precession of the equinoxes with an imaginary trembling of the eighth sphere), which Regiomontanus inserted into the final chapter.The work, which fills forty pages, features no introductory or concluding remarks of any kind. It first discusses the canonical seven planets, which is followed by some additional chapters on more general phenomena. A table of contents (there in none in the book itself) would read as follows:On the SunOn the MoonOn the Dragon(i.e. the nodes)of the MoonOn the Three Superior(sc. planets, that is, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn)On VenusOn MercuryOn the Different Affections(namely positions, aspects, kinds of motion, and eclipses)of the PlanetsOn Declination and LatitudeOn the Motion of the Eighth Sphere.Peuerbach tries very hard to describe and explain to his pupils the apparently irregular movement of the planets and their varying distances from the earth within a geocentric framework. To this end, each planet is assigned asphaera, which is composed of a number of nested solid shells of a certain thickness calledorbes. Each of a shell's two surfaces, the inner and the outer, is perfectly spherical and either has the same midpoint as the world at large or a different one: it is eitherconcentricusoreccentricus. To one of the shells, the planet itself is attached. In some cases, however, the respective shell in addition holds in itself an epicycle, that is, a further thin shell containing a spherical cavity, having the planet attached to itself and turning round with it. Peuerbach's sources for this highly complicated system are Ptolemy'sPlanetary Hypothesesand a number of Arab astronomers from the 9th to 11th centuries: Al-Farghani, Thabit ibn Qurra, Al-Battani, and Ibn al-Haytham. Peuerbach does not argue for the correctness of the system or expound on its mathematical aspects. All his efforts are directed toward making the students understand the basic outlines. Accordingly, his language is clear, repetitive, and syntactically simple. For the modern reader, most difficulties arise from the technical terms, as not all of them are explained at their first appearance. The beginning of the chapter about the moon may serve as an example:Luna habet orbes quattuor et unam sphaerulam. Primo enim habet tres orbes sicut sol in figuratione dispositos, scilicet duos eccentricos secundum quid, qui vocantur orbes augem eccentrici lunae deferentes et tertium eccentricum simpliciter in horum medio locatum, qui deferens epicyclum appellatur.Besides the terms already mentioned, three more create problems in this passage, namelysphaerula(""little sphere""), which is used as a synonym for ""epicycle"",secundum quid, which qualifies shells as eccentric with regard to one, but not both of their surfaces (and thus of uneven thickness), andaux(gen.augis), an expression of Arabic origin (<awj) meaning ""apogee"".Over one-third of the work's length is taken by 29 sophisticated diagrams, which are indispensable for understanding Peuerbach's reasoning. They even seem to be highlighted in the title, althoughtheoricais not found in the meaning ""diagram"" in lexica of medieval Latin and probably means something like ""theory"" in Gerard of Cremona, who uses it in the singular. In Peuerbach's title, by contrast, the expression is in the plural, while every single diagram is separately titledTheorica solis,Theorica lunaeetc. This strongly indicates that in the language of Peuerbach and Regiomontanus, the word denotes a diagram.TheTheoricae novae planetarumhad tremendous success. At least 56 printed editions were published until 1653. There also was a French version and, more importantly, a great number of commentaries (for instance theTheoricae novae planetarum cum commentoand the one concludingPetri Nonii Salaciensis opera), which prove the widespread use of the work as a textbook.

"Peuerbach, Georg von,Capuanus, Franciscus",Theoricae novae planetarum cum commento,,1495,Venice,"Bevilacqua, Simone",15th century since invention of printing,"Textbook, Commentary",Astronomy/Astrology/Cosmography,Theoricae novae planetarum cum commento(MDZ),not available,"Soon after their publication in 1472, Georg von Peuerbach'sTheoricae novae planetarumattained the status of a classic and were widely used in university teaching. As it was customary at the time, this meant that the professor read the text in class and explained it. In 1495, the Paduan cleric and professor of astronomy Franciscus Capuanus was the first to transfer such a lecture course to writing, issuing the first commented edition of Peuerbach's work. (For a later commentary, seePetri Nonii Salaciensis opera, pp. 197–307.) The book, which is printed in blackletter with a high amount of abbreviations and set in two columns, opens with a dedication to Ferdinand II of Aragon, king of Sicily. It is concluded by praise of Capuanus in the form of an epigram by a certain Vincentinus Tuscus.Capuanus' commentary, which fills some 170 pages, is introduced by a proem (fols. a2r–a3r). After a somewhat cryptic statement to the effect that theTheoricae novae planetarumare commonly used as a surrogate for theAlmagestbecause of ""lack of books"" (inopia librorum), Capuanus explains that his commentary is the first he knows of and then follows the common practice of introducing a work of this kind by general questions, discussing ""the aim … or topic of this work, its usefulness, subdivision, structure, and manner of teaching"" (intentionem … seu operis huius subiectum, utilitatem, divisionem, ordinem et viam doctrinae). Within the commentary proper, Peuerbach's text and Capuanus' commentary are set in larger and smaller font respectively and alternate: the former is broken up in chunks varying in length between a few lines and a page or so, which are followed by the respective explanations. Often, the quotations from Peuerbach are framed by the formulaDeinde cum dicit … declarat …(""Next when he says … he states…""). This layout presumably reflects the way in which Capuanus presented the text and commented on it in class. It also was easier to handle for the printer than the one customary from the manuscript age in which a commentary surrounded the ground text on all or some sides (as for example inVadianus' commentary on Mela). Text and explanations are illustrated by somewhat crude diagrams. All in all, Peuerbach's text fills around 15%, the diagrams 10%, and the commentary 75% of the pages.For the most part, the commentary remains strictly subservient to the text. Its main concern is to paraphrase and clarify the meaning of Peuerbach's argument. The diagrams are indispensable to this end and are accordingly often referenced by Capuanus. He must have used them already in his teaching in class. Much energy is spent on clarifying the structure of Peuerbach's account, as in the following example (fol. n ii v):Expedita cum laude Dei theoricali determinatione omnium errantium stellarum motuum reliquarumque passionum earum in hac parte aggreditur scientiam octavae sphaerae motuum et proprietatum.After absolving with praise of God the theorical determination of all movements and other affections of the planets, in the following part he turns to the knowledge of the movements and characteristics of the eighth sphere.Cross references within the commentary itself are a common feature as well (e.g. fol. f 3 v). Occasionally, Peuerbach's remarks are set into the wider context of the astronomical and philosophical – that is, Aristotelian – tradition at large. Sometimes, doubts are raised and answered (e.g. fol. g 6 v).Capuanus' way of speaking is impersonal. He appears exclusively dedicated to the problems posed by his text and hardly ever addresses his audience of students or readers. In terms of style, his presumably humanist education shows in the correct use of features of classical Latin such as theaccusativus cum infinitivoor the subjunctive. Apart from that, however, he has no intention to sacrifice the established late medieval classroom style to humanism. For instance, he turns infinitives into substantives without blinking an eye:Cuius ratio est quod sicut unumquodque se habet ad esse ita ad cognosci, ut fatetur philosophus secundo Metaphysicae.(""The reason of this fact is that each thing relates to 'to be' as it does to 'to be known', as the philosopher proclaims in book 2 of theMetaphysics"", fol. a 2 r). 
In the more technical parts, long sentences, great logical complexity, and highly technical vocabulary make the commentary a very taxing read, as the following description of a peculiarity of Mercury exemplifies (fol. h 3 r; orthography preseved, abbreviations in brackets):S(e)c(un)do e(st) notandu(m) quod q(uidam?) astronomi p(er)ceperu(n)t ut declarat ptholemeus in Alma(gest) centru(m) epi(cycli) mercurii ex(ta)ns in auge eq(uan)tis e(ss)e in auge d(e)fere(n)tis ut dicet postea (et) in maxi(m)a a terra remotio(n)e (et) in opposito augis eq(uan)tis no(n) maxi(m)e terre ap(p)propinq(ua)ri ut infra mathematice patefaciem[sic].",,"Petri Nonii Salaciensis opera‎(← links)Peuerbach, Georg von‎(← links)Theoricae novae planetarum‎(← links)Capuanus, Franciscus‎(← links)Commentaria cum amplissimis additionibus super Anatomia Mundini‎(← links)","Peuerbach, Georg von; Capuanus, Franciscus:Theoricae novae planetarum cum commento, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Theoricae_novae_planetarum_cum_commento(last revision: 23.02.2022).",,MK,,MK,

It thus completes the picture of Silesia's nature by cataloguing the regional fauna, which had been missing in the first publication. The catalogue of animals is about 150 pages longer than the catalogue of plants and minerals and structured into six books: book 1 deals with animals in general (pp. 1–41), while book 2–6 list the quadrupeds (pp. 43–135), reptiles (pp. 137–68), birds (pp. 169–376), fish (pp. 377–456) and insects of Silesia (pp. 457–564).Overall, the layout of theTheriotropheum Silesiaeand the structure of the entries is similar to theStirpium et fossilium Silesiae catalogus: the entries are ordered alphabetically; they vary in the amount of detail, but in general, a typical entry provides a list of alternative names in Latin, Greek and German (with Silesian names being marked as such), describes briefly the animal in question, and informs the reader where it can be found (and caught), how it lives, and how it can be used. Like the catalogue of plants and minerals, the catalogue of animals does not contain any images. At the beginning of both book, there is a list of sources, which comprises classical and contemporary authors. However, there are also important differences: while the catalogues of plants andfossiliawere each prefaced only with categorizing charts, the catalogue of animals features a whole introductory book on animals, and each of books 2–6 starts with a definition, subdivision and a general and systematic description of the category of animals it is devoted to (e.g. ""fish"", or ""bird"") instead of beginning abruptely with the first item in the alphabet.The paratext of theTheriotropheum(containing no less than seven panegyric poems) also features a long and rhetorically profuse dedication letter by Caspar Schwenckfeld to Johann von Nostitz, which is pervaded by religious reflections and adorned with many quotes from the bible and ancient literature. In it, Schwenckfeld indicates that he composed both his catalogues for medical students (in tironum gratiam): like plants and minerals, animals belong to themateria medica, and the study of the study of animals is important for both dietetics and drugs. As in theStirpium et fossilium Silesiae catalogus, the idea of the indigenous plays an important role: instead of relying on exotic substances, one should closely study the local nature: in comparison to local floras and mineralogies, local zoologies were relatively rare and often had a more general touch, as can seen be the fact that Schwenckfeld includes exotic animals like elephants and camels in his catalogue (p. 72, 89; cf.Cooper 2007, 116).",Cooper 2007,"Stirpium et fossilium Silesiae catalogus‎(← links)Schwenckfeld, Caspar‎(← links)","Schwenckfeld, Caspar:Theriotropheum Silesiae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Theriotropheum_Silesiae(last revision: 07.09.2021).","In the colophone, the date of printing is indicated as 1604, one year later than the date on the title page.In the dedication letter, the need for human beings to learn until old age is explained by the Fall of Man, which corrupted Adam’s perfect knowledge: now, the longer one lives, the more things one finds to learn.

The book was written by the physician François Blondel who was responsible for Aachen's development into one of the most modern spas in Europe after the devastating fire of 1656. While the closing lines of the book are addressed to fellow learned physicians, the introductory ""guide"" to Aachen, its catheral and various baths, the detailed description of therapeutic procedure from the arrival to the departure of the patient, the emphasis on the success of the therapies (with cured noble men and women as attractive witnesses) as well as warnings against detrimental behavior during the treatments strongly suggest that the book was intended to be read by potential patients and spa guests as well. Several pictures are added to illustrate the scientific content, but even more so the architecture and bathing treatments in Aachen. In terms of the scientific content, Blondel’s aim is not only to describe and examine the properties of Aachen's thermal water and its existing medical applications: he also uses his book to propagate drinking thermal water (potatio) as a new medical treatment in addition to the well-established bathing therapies (balneatio).The monograph is dedicated to the officials of Aachen, starting with the topos of the playfulness of nature which expresses itself most wonderfully in thermal springs. While bathing in Aachen’s thermal springs has been practiced since antiquity (and by famous figures such as Charlemagne), the new method of drinking thermal water rises from the ashes. Blondel links scientific progress to the promotion of the city of Aachen in the closing paragraph, combining Seneca’s optimistic vision of progress at the end of theNaturales quaestioneswith a handful of elegiac couplets (perhaps inspired by Vergil’s fifthEclogue) which envision people from different nations coming to drink from Aachen’s thermal water so that the city will flourish and water will repair what the fire destroyed (quidquid / ignis destruxit, mox reparabit aqua).The scientific chapters start with a general discussion of the origin of mineral and other traces in thermal water (chapter 3) and the cause for the warm temperature of thermal water (chapter 4). The author moves on to the specifics of Aachen’s thermal water, which are divided by method into bathing (chapters 5–7) and drinking (chapters 8–12). For each method, Blondel lists the illnesses that can be treated by the thermal water and advises on the right use (and dangers of abuse). The Latin prose is mostly simple in style and to the point, occasionally adorned with poetic citations. Both ancient and contemporary authors are cited. Many parts of the text are descriptive, though some are argumentative, a feature most prominent in the chapters on drinking thermal water, a controversial method that Blondel aims to vindicate in this book. While the author announces to do so by drawing on a mix of authorities, reason and experience, in the chapters on drinking thermal water, he takes the opportunity to reflect on the role of authority and argue for thelibertas philosophandi(p. 155–7). Learned men are human and can make mistakes, therefore one should not sheepishly follow the predecessors when truth lies elsewhere:Pecorum mos est antecedentium gregem sequi, et qua itur, non qua eundum, pergere. In this context, Blondel also vindicates the new achievements in comparison to the admirable antiquity. He illustrates this by continuing quotes from Vergil and Ovid about progress with his own verses, encouraging the reader not to be afraid of new things and use reason to evaluate whether scientific findings are true or not.Although Blondel was not the first to write about Aachen’s thermal springs, his book seems to be the most successful one. An unauthorized reprint of the Latin text appeared in 1685, a third, authorized and revised edition followed only three years later. This edition of 1688 exhibits not only a much more beautiful layout than the first, but is enriched by a wealth of approbations and paratextual poems, which points to the esteem of the medical author and promotor of Aachen's thermal springs. In the same year of 1688, a German translation of the text was printed, a Dutch one followed three decades later.",Müller 1903;Weberbauer 1977,"Blondel, François‎(← links)","Blondel, François:Thermarum Aquisgranensium et Porcetanarum descriptio, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Thermarum_Aquisgranensium_et_Porcetanarum_descriptio(last revision: 22.11.2021).",,,Yes,IT,

Rather, a considerable number of propositions is presented in running text in 13 short, unnumbered sections, whose titles announce the following topics: mathematics in general; arithmetics and algebra; ratios and proportionalities; geometry; lines intersecting at right and sharp angles as well as parallels; secants and tangents; measurement of angles; proportionality of line segments; plane figures; areas of their surfaces; surfaces of solid bodies; volumes of solid bodies; trigonometry. The style is simple and laconic: short main clauses connected by a bare minimum of conjunctions and pronouns, a restricted lexicon of technical terms, which are repeated without restraint, colourless verbs, often in the passive, no explanations (somewhat surprisingly, no formulas, equations and diagrams either). The section on plane figures begins (p. 6):Figura plana est spatium lineis terminatum. Omnium simplicissima est triangulum. Tres anguli trianguli rectilinei sunt aequales duobus rectis. In eodem triangulo anguli aequales lateribus aequalibus opponuntur et vicissim.A plane figure is an area circumscribed by lines. The simplest of all is the triangle.

In one and the same triangle, equal angles are situated opposite equal sides and vice versa.The manifold contents of theMathematical Theses(not always as trivial as in the present example) can hardly have been discussed in full within one hour and a half. Moreover, the contents are mathematical truths which cannot be meaningfully opposed and defended. The text seems to bear witness to a form ofdisputatiowhich differs from the standard model in which the respondent had to defend a set of assertions against the objections of an opponent (Gindhart; Marti; Seidel 2016). The unusual terminology on the title page points in the same direction: The theses ""will be demonstrated"" (demonstrabuntur), not defended, by Hachet. Huerne is not supposed to oppose him, but to ""open the disputation"" (disputationem aperiet). Rolland is not calledpraeses, butarbiter(""judge"").

Among the most extensive and thorough treatises is the presentTreatise with Case Reports on the Disease of the Genitals or French Diseasecomposed by the Spaniard Gaspar Torrella, personal physician to the popes Alexander VI and Giulio II and bishop of Santa Giusta, and dedicated to Cesare Borgia, who presumably suffered from syphilis himself.The dedication seamlessly merges into the main text, which falls into the two distinct parts named in the title, a short monograph (pp. 187–207) and fiveconsilia(literally ""advices"", but actually case histories, pp. 208–230; on the genre, see the entry on theConsiliaof Bartholomaeus de Montagna). In the first section, after narrating how Borgia questioned him about the disease, Torrella initially talks about what would be called the placebo effect today before embarking on a discussion of the possible causes of syphilis. The latter remains inconclusive despite the fact that the disease's sexual origin is taken for granted later, as Torrella's first patient is said to have had an affair with a syphilitic woman (rem habuit cum muliere habente pudendagram, p. 208). Next, Torrella argues, against contrary opinions, that syphilis is curable, and explains his chosen name for the disease (p. 192): he calls itpudendagrabecause it infests the private parts (pudenda; although he does not say so, the word is evidently formed after the model of ""podagra""). The two main symptoms are blisters and pain. Several varieties can be distinguished. The cure comprises prescriptions for food, drink, and lifestyle as well as various drugs, whose recipes are given. Part one closes with a sigh of relief in the form of a short epigram.The five cases reported in the second part – two men identified by name and three anonymous patients – are told in the form of first person narratives. Each story starts from a description of the respective patient, followed by the development of the disease. Then Torrella narrates the therapy applied by him, which in accordance with the monographic part comprises dietetic prescriptions on the one hand and medications on the other. Because theconsiliaare intended to provide paradigms for other doctors, the author also discloses the reasoning on which his various prescriptions are based. Sometimes, authorities like Galen or Avicenna are invoked in this context, but mostly, Torrella himself is in the fore, coming across as an expert who has very clear ideas what to do and why (p. 210):In cura per potionem habui tres intentiones: prima ad evacuandum, secunda ad resolvendum, tertia ad consumendum reliquias. Prima fuit completa cum digestivis et evacuativis …In treating [the patient] with potions, I followed three aims: the first [pertained] to his discharge, the second, to relaxing him, the third, to removing the remaining symptoms. The first aim was attained with digestives and laxatives…This passage also exemplifies Torrella's style, which is marked by unclassical syntax (cum digestivisinstead of pure instrumental ablative), ellipses, nominalisation (habui tres intentionesinstead ofhaec tria intendi) and technical terminology (digestivis,evacuativis).

The dedicatory letter takes astronomy and especially geography as examples to illustrate the progress of science since antiquity. The knowledge of the ancients has become obsolete, particularly because of the efforts of the English explorers.

Generic boundaries were particularly fluent in this field. Many works combined characteristics of theregimenand theconsilium, as they proposed hygienic and dietary measures to prevent an infection as well as remedies.The presentTreatise about the Plague, whose composition may have been prompted by repeated outbreaks of the plague in the Netherlands during the early 16th century, is a typical specimen of plague literature in some, but not in all respects. It is unusually short, comprising just two and a half octavo pages. Apparently, it was seen as a fitting appendix to a more generalRegimen sanitatisby its author. In addition to preventive and curative measures, the work also contains some theoretical reflections. Much of its contents goes back to the plague report of the medical faculty of Paris (1348), which had a decisive influence on European plague literature in general. The first section is dedicated to the causes of the plague. As far as external factors are concerned, the disease is provoked byaere corrupto(""putrified air""). People whose humours are out of balance as well as people living in unclean conditions are particularly liable to contract the plague, which therefore claims more victims among the poor than among the rich. However, both the putrefaction of the air and a bad bodily condition are to be seen as ""intermediary causes"" (causae intermediae) only, as they are themselves caused by certain conjunctions of the planets. The next section is a catalogue ofSigna futurae pestis(""Indications of a future plague"") in key-word style: ""Great heat with rapidly changing clouds. Frequent rainfalls"" etc. Under the headingCura(""Cure""), dietetic and therapeutic measures are united: Readers are advised to flee the city, drink good wine, and recur to generous bloodletting if they have been infected. Finally, recipes for five medications are given: two potions, one laxative, one kind of pills and an artificial ""apple"" (pomum), which must not be eaten, but should be smelled at.Surprisingly, the text ends with a proud tribute to the author's home region, printed in big gothic letters:Vivat Arthesia felix, ""Long live happy Artois!""",,"Grospré, Robert‎(← links)","Grospré, Robert:Tractatus de peste, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tractatus_de_peste(last revision: 29.11.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In the early modern era, this opinion was challenged by, among others,Alessandro Piccolomini,Christoph Clavius, andJean Fernel. When Nonio Marcello Saia, a south Italian mathematician and astronomer who became personal astrologer of the French queen Caterina de' Medici, found this novel view in these three authors, he decided to get to the bottom of the matter, as he explains in his letter of dedication to Philipp de Hurault, the pro-chancellor of France at the time.  Saia emphasizes that he did so having recourse to ""experience, the mother of all sciences"" (disciplinarum omnium matrem et altricem, experientiam, fol. Aijr). The results are presented in hisTreatise in Which It Is Shown that the Dry Land is Larger than the Water. Between the dedication and the beginning of the treatise proper, two epigrams in praise of the author and his work, one page of errata, and an author portrait are inserted. From the last, which shows Saia at the age of 86, one learns that he published the treatise as a very old man.The main text, which fills 60 quarto pages, features a tight, coherent argumentation and a clear structure, which is made evident by subtitles throughout. After a short address to the reader (fol. 1r), five arguments – some of them difficult to grasp – to the effect that water occupies more space than dry land are adduced (fols. 1r–4r): (1) as the element of fire takes more space than air, air more than water, so water must be more extended than earth; (2) when earth turns into water, it expands; (3) a greater area of dry land above sea level would disturb the natural order of the elements; (4) there are more water animals than land animals; (5) sailors approaching a cost first get sight of the top of a tower, which indicates that the level of the water is higher than the level of the dry land. Next, it is explained that ""larger"" and ""smaller"" can be understood in two ways, namely with regard to a surface and a volume (fol. 4r–v), and different bodies of sweet water are enumerated  (fols. 4v–5v). Proofs are provided that the sea is not larger than the dry land with regard to their respective surfaces (fols. 5v–7r), and the reader is advised how to check this on a globe: he should subdivide it by circles of longitude and latitude and count the parts taken up by each element (fols. 7r–10v). After that, it is demonstrated that the water on earth is also no match for the earth itself in terms of its volume (fols. 10v–14r). The five abovementioned reasons against Saia's opinion are recapitulated and refuted one by one (fols. 14r–20r). Finally, this argumentative rebuttal is complemented by a detailed analysis of the mistakes and misunderstandings made in the invocation of ancient authorities by those championing the greater extension of water (fols. 20r–30v). In line with the work's sober tone, it ends without a proper conclusion.The treatise presents an interesting mixture of modernist and traditional elements. On the one hand, Saia emphasizes the importance of experience and highlights the fact that the geographical knowledge level of his own day is superior to that of antiquity; ancient authors are even treated with some condescension in this respect (fols. 5v–6r, 11v–12v). At the same time, the overall structure of his reasoning – his own position, possible counter-arguments, his own arguments, refutation of counter-arguments – seems to be inspired by the scholasticquaestio disputata(Lawn 1993). The very importance accorded to experience (experientia) is bolstered, of all things, by an argument from (Aristotle's) authority (fol. 5v), and what Saia understands by that term is not autopsy: his proofs ""from experience"" (fols. 5v–7r) are in fact taken from geographical writings, maps, globes, and oral testimonies of travelers. In the following section, ""experience"" means manipulating a globe, as already described. Also with regard to many individual issues, Saia comes across as a traditional thinker. For instance, Aristotle's four elements (which are also discussed in greater detail in an appendix, fols. 31r–39v) are taken for granted, and the sphere of the moon is supposed to be solid (fol. 14v).The treatise's language more or less conforms to its content, as the author's Latin has a palpable scholastic tinge. His proofs that the dry land is larger than the sea, for instance, are introduced by the following invocation of experience (fol. 5v):Pro huiusmodi rei cognitione sciendum est iuxta Aristotelem, quod nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in sensu. Ex qua quidem propositione elicitur Aristotelem sensus certitudinem magni fecisse et sensatam experientiam rationi praeposuisse voluisseque sensus non quovis modo impediti notitiam in rebus, in quibus sensata notitia haberi potest, semper super omnes alias notitias certissimam esse. Super qua sensata notitia seu experientia astrologia et medicina ac omnes aliae artes fundatae et firmatae sunt et inde exaltatae. Ab experientiis enim, quas diligentes observatores fecerunt, rationes invenire coeperunt.To discern a matter of this kind, one must know that, according to Aristotle, nothing is in the mind that has not been in sensory perception before. From this tenet, one can infer that Aristotle had a high opinion of the certainty of sensory perception and that he thought experience founded on the senses more important than reasoning and that he wanted the information given by a sense that is not impaired in some way to be always most certain, more than any other information, in matters in which sensory information can be had. On this sensory information or experience, astronomy and medicine and all other sciences are founded and confirmed by it and erected on it. For it was from experiences made by careful observers that they began to find reasons.Not only phrases likeiuxta Aristotelem(instead ofsecundum Aristotelem),fundare super aliqua re(instead ofaliqua re niti) orexperientias facere(instead ofexperiri) smack of the academic classroom here, the initialquod-phrase used as an alternative to the following accusatives with infinitives does as well. The total indifference regarding word repetition is another indication that Saia had no stylistic ambitions in the humanist sense of the word.",,,"Saia, Nonio Marcello:Tractatus, in quo terram esse aqua maiorem demonstratur, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tractatus,_in_quo_terram_esse_aqua_maiorem_demonstratur(last revision: 27.11.2021).","Cf.

This is due the fact that he could be accused of being imprudent and thoughtless (imprudentia et temeritas); imprudent because there are already many people successfully working in this field of geometry with the methods inherited from antiquity; thoughtless because he has dedicated the work to the senate of Middelburg. In the following, Lansberg explains how his small and plain (rudis) work profits from his predecessors but now offers an easy and useful approach to trigonometry, which should be of benefit for many people. Moreover, Lansbergen states that as he has written much of this book in Middelburg and has profited from patronage, he thinks it natural to dedicate it to the senate of Middelburg. After this dedication letter follows a short letter to the “mathematical reader” (mathematico lectori) where Lansbergen explains in which way his tables differ from those ofErasmus ReinholdusandGeorg Rheticus. He had left out thesinuum, tangentium et secantium differentias [...] arealesthat Reinholdus and Rheticus had added as he thought them to be not important enough and thus decided not to increase the number of pages. There are three laudatory poems, a long Latin hexametrical poem by Ianus Dousa Filius as well as a Latin and a shorter Greek poem by Jacobus Gruterus.The four books comprise the definitions of the trigonometric functions (book I), the construction of the trigonometric tables and the tables themselves (book II), calculations of angles and sides in plane (book III) and spherical triangles (book IV).The books themselves are divided into πορίσματα (porismata; i.e. propositions intermediate between a theorem and a problem). The language is – as is typical for mathematical texts – quite brief. Many geometrical figures illustrate the text. There are furthermore tables (“canones“) at the end of book two for different values of sinus, tangent (taken over from Erasmus Reinhold'sPrutenicae tabulae), and secant (taken over from Georg Rheticus'sCanon doctrinae triangulorum), whereas the new notions ofsecant,tangentandradius(the latter instead of the commonly usedsinus totus) are taken over from Thomas Finck'sGeometria rotundiwhich had appeared only eight years before. Also, most of the results are not original work by Lansbergen; the sine law and with its proof show close similarities to the one ofRegiomontanusinDe triangulis omnimodis, other proofs are obviously copied from theGeometria rotundi. Lansbergen's work is the first one in which the spherical cosine rules for sides and for angles appear next to each other in print; however, it is not the first one presenting the spherical law of cosines for angles as claimed by the author. This was already the case inViète'sCanon mathematicus seu ad triangula. Probably the most important contribution of this work is the systematic and easier-to-understand presentation of the topic.A second, augmented edition appeared 1631 with Blaeuw in Amsterdam.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 8, 27–28.Braunmühl 1900, 192","Lansbergen, Philips van‎(← links)Canon doctrinae triangulorum‎(← links)","Lansbergen, Philips van:Triangulorum geometria, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Triangulorum_geometria(last revision: 06.02.2022).","Was könnten die im Brief an den mathematischen Leser genannten ""sinuum, tangentium et secantium differentias (ut vocant), areales, quas Rheinholdus et Rheticus suis canonibus addiderunt"" sein?",FB,Yes,"DB, FB",

Throughout his career, he composed numerous encyclopedias, on various occasions and topics. The one entitledTriumphus Bibliorum sacrorum, the first ever encyclopedic work of this kind, contributed to his fame. Composed in the tradition of the so-calledphysica sacraorphysica Mosaicagenre (cf. for instance Johann Jakob Scheuchzer'sPhysica sacra), the work presents a thorough account of all Biblicallociconcerned with what Alsted defines as sciences, including physics, botany, medicine, natural philosophy, jurisprudence and theology. In the preface to the treatise, Alsted admits that as his work is an encyclopedia, he relies on the findings of his predecessors in respective fields. He enumerates the authors whose writings he used; these include Levinus Lemnius (on botany: on ""plants and herbs taken from the Bible""),  Franciscus Valesius of Spain,medicus et philosophus(on sacred philosophy), Lambert Danaeu (on politics, ethics and other ""practical"" sciences) and Konrad Heresbach (on law). By indicating the countries of these authors' origin, Alsted suggests that all the major authorities are from different parts of Europe, thus making his own encyclopedia a universal text that covers the whole variety of Biblical subjects regardless of political and religious orientation. He also admits that apart from the aforementioned primary authorities, he used other sources, which in the end allows him to make his treatise as detailed as possible, in his words, for the benefit of Christian teaching since all the sciences date back to the Bible.The main body of the text is structured in accordance with different fields of knowledge. As a whole, Alsted provides the quotations from the Scripture concerned with a respective science, field of knowledge or literary genre (for instance,biographia sacra) and, in some cases, which he finds worth an explanation, supplements the biblical text with short references to other sources or serves himself as a commentator of the most obscure passages. Even though from a modernist point of view, the text is not at the forefront of the scientific argument, thus, for example, relying on the traditional cosmological framework, it represents the contemporary state of the art and perfectly demonstrates the ways in which early seventeenth-century sought to combine scientific discoveries withphysica sacra.",,"Alsted, Johann Heinrich‎(← links)","Alsted, Johann Heinrich:Triumphus Bibliorum sacrorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Triumphus_Bibliorum_sacrorum(last revision: 27.09.2021).","C. 600 quarto pages.

Gassendi's biography of him, the first one ever written, is an exceptional specimen of its genre in at least two respects. First, it is a self-contained work of considerable length, comprising six books and over 250 pages without all paratexts. Second, it is unconnected to Brahe's demise, as it was published some 50 years after.The biography proper is accompanied by an impressive array of paratexts. An introductory letter to Gassendi's friend and patron Henri Louis Habert de Montmor first explains the genesis of the work (providing interesting insights into Gassendi's network and into the inedited sources collected by him from Brahe's friends and family) and then embarks on a history of astronomy, whose development culminates in no other than Brahe. This provides a smooth transition to the biography itself, which is prefixed by a portrait of Brahe. After the biography, one finds a funerary oration by Johann von Jessen and two funerary elegies, the first of which is by Johannes Kepler. Next comes a recipe of Tycho for an elixir against the plague in the form of a letter to Rudolf II, followed by another letter to the same, originally meant as a preface to Tycho's star catalogue but actually not printed, plus a list of stars whose positions in this catalogue are different with respect to earlier ones. Two more testimonies of Brahe's fame are provided in the form of a note on him in Jacques Auguste de Thou's history and a poem by a certain Laubanus. Finally, there is a copious index, errata and a Privilège du Roy. Brahe's life is accompanied by a somewhat shorter biography of Copernicus and a double biography of Peuerbach and Regiomontanus, accompanied by a separate index. Thereby, the book as a whole presents the four most important astronomers from the early Renaissance to 1600 in inverse chronological order.TheVitaitself, by contrast, progresses chronologically, as underlined by the respective years added as marginalia, until Brahe dies at the end of book five. Book six is dedicated to his looks, character, habits, funeral and material as well as intellectual legacy. Among the latter, his posthumously edited books and the astronomical instruments designed by him take an important place. Gassendi exploits a vast source material, some of which – especially numerous letters and poems by, to and about Brahe – are quoted verbatim. There are also a few charts and diagrams (e.g. p. 89: the Tychonic world system). Brahe's astronomical work is presented in considerable technical detail by the consummate astronomer Gassendi. Despite theVita's strong panegyrical slant, touchy topics are not avoided altogether, although they are handled very tactfully. In the last book, for instance, Gassendi discusses Brahe's astrological and alchemical leanings, his adherence to the Lutheran church and some less endearing character traits such as his irascibility (pp. 214–23, 227–30). Gassendi never is at a loss for the fitting word, writes in an unobtrusive, reader-friendly style and can on occasion be a vivid narrator, as when he tells of Brahe's observation of the 1572 supernova (pp. 21–22).Thanks to the author's astronomical expertise, the amount of sources unearthed by him, his representational ability and his personal fame, his life of Brahe proved very influential. It was reprinted the following year, included into Gassendi'sOpera omnia(1658, reprinted 1727) and became the basis of all subsequent biographies of the Danish astronomer until the present day.",Hansen 2007,"Gassendi, Pierre‎(← links)De vita et morte Tychonis Brahei oratio funebris‎(← links)In obitu Petri Gassendi lugubre encomium‎(← links)","Gassendi, Pierre:Tychonis Brahei vita, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tychonis_Brahei_vita(last revision: 07.06.2021).",,"MK, IT",Yes,MK,

Auctore Ioanne Beguino, regis eleemosynario",,1612,Paris,Matteo il Maestro,17th century,"Textbook, Compendia","Alchemy/Chemistry, Medicine",Tyrocinium chymicum(MDZ)Alternative link:Google Books,971293,"This is the second, much-expanded edition, and the last published by the author himself, of Jean Béguin'sIntroduction to Chymistry for Beginners. From 1604, Béguin had a laboratory in Paris and gave chymistry lessons to interested doctors, apothecaries, and others. His activity as a teacher as well as his book mark an important step in chymistry's long way out of secrecy.The work is surrounded by a number of attractive and instructive paratexts. After dedicating himself and his work to God in the form of anellogium, Béguin starts with a motto, a  quotation from Paracelsus (in fact, pseudo-Paracelsus,Newman 2006, 509) highlighting the necessity to master the practicalities of chymistry. In the preface to the reader, much information about the work’s genesis is given: because Béguin and his pupils were sick and tired of dictating and writing down recipes, Béguin published a printed version of these recipes in 1610. This work was republished in Cologne without his knowledge. As a result, Béguin was reviled by colleagues for profaning the secrets of the art, and his laboratory was robbed. Nonetheless, he now publishes a second, expanded edition. Béguin defends the superiority of chymical over conventional drugs against critics who denigrate the former as useless and harmful but is nonetheless convinced that Galenic and Paracelsian medicine should work hand in hand. The recipes of some particularly valuable medicines – those described in the last book, one supposes – he has protected from ignorants by the use of deliberately obscure language. Three poems of praise – two short elegies, one epigram – have Art and Nature discuss who is more worthy of singing the author's praise, extol him as a new Jason who brings a new Golden Fleece from Colchis, and turn against a malevolent critic respectively. The last introductory paratext is a table of contents. At the very end of the book, one finds an ""Extraict du privilège du roi"" which grants the publisher, Matteo del Maestro, the exclusive right to reprint it for six years.The main text comprises a little under 200 octavo pages is divided into three books comprising six, twenty, and three chapters respectively. The first book (pp. 1–51) starts from a definition of chymistry and a discussion of its name. After that, it explains the chymical operations, of which there are two basic kinds:solutio, the resolution of mixed bodies into their elementary components, mercury, sulfur, and salt, andcoagulatio, which strangely is defined not as the opposite of the former but as the production of solid matter out of liquids. Whilecoagulatiois not subdivided any further,solutiocomprises many more specific operations. The first book closes with some remarks on the instruments needed by the chemist and their manufacturing. The second book (pp. 53–171), the longest by far, is devoted to the products of the chymical art. Some precepts on how to distill (pp. 54–59) are followed by a long series of recipes. The short book three (pp. 172–187) comprises three particularly long and elaborate recipes, which describe the extraction ofquinta essentia, a mysterious and most efficacious substance, from human blood, wine, and corals.Although the work thus ends on an esoteric note, Béguin nonetheless goes far in shedding the secretiveness of his fellow chemists. As already clarified in the introductory paratexts, he by and large understands chymistry as a branch of pharmacology and wishes to teach his knowledge to everyone who is interested. That he wants his book to be practically useful is evident from his clear and precise remarks on chymical instruments and techniques and from his numerous definitions of technical terms in the opening part of his work. The definition ofchymiaitself from which he starts (p. 1) is a good example:Chymia est ars corpora naturalia mixta solvendi  et soluta coagulandi ad medicamenta gratiora, salubriora et tutiora concinnanda.(""Chymistry is the art of resolving natural mixed bodies and bringing those resolved together in order to produce more agreeable and efficacious as well as safer medicines."") To the reader who has thus acquired the necessary technical terminology, the recipes, which are set out in the style that is typical of that text type, pose no problems (except, as already mentioned, for thequinta essentialrecipes, which are interspersed with esoteric terminology). A typical recipe reads as follows (p. 75):SPIRITUS NITRINitrum sive sal petrae misceatur cum tribus partibus boli communis et destilletur per retortam spatio decem vel duodecim horarum. Ex libra una salis petrae accipies libram unam spiritus, si bene operatus fueris. Spiritus hic es verus ignis naturae balsamicus et prodest in colica, pleuresi, angina.SPIRIT OF  NATRONNatron or saltpeter may be mixed with three parts of common clay and distilled in a retort for a timespan of ten or twelve hours. Out of one pound of saltpeter you will receive one pound of spirit if you have worked diligently. This spirit is a true balsamic fire of nature, and it helps in cases of colic, pleurisy, and angina.Being the first book to talk about chymistry so openly and with clear didactic intent, Béguin's work proved extremely popular. It was often republished, in many cases with additions from later hands, until the end of the 17th century. A French translation, titledLes elemens de chimie, already appeared during Béguin's lifetime, in 1615, and proved successful as well, an English translation, in 1669. TheTyrocinium chymicuminaugurated a new genre of chymical works, the introduction for a wider interested readership. This genre was among the preconditions for the eventual emergence of scientific chemistry.Those interested in learning more about Béguin's remarkable work and its fate may turn to the very full and thorough account byPatterson 1937.","Patterson 1937Newman 2006, 508–510","Béguin, Jean‎(← links)","Béguin, Jean:Tyrocinium chymicum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Tyrocinium_chymicum(last revision: 19.04.2022).",it is explicitly distinguished from anintegrum chymiae systemaon p. 53),MK,Yes,MK,

Großinger himself explains the layout of the whole work in the introduction to the first volume (p. 49–51). However, he only managed to publish the first five volumes which comprise the entire description of the animal kingdom and the first part of the description of the plant kingdom. Four more volumes remained in manuscript (cf. his entry inScriptores provinciae Austriacae Societatis Iesu, vol. 1, Vienna 1855, p. 108–9).The published volumes alone cover well over 2000 octavo pages, testifying to the impressive scope of the work. The enourmous amount of material is structured in a way that each volume represents a specific branch of the respective kingdom of nature: within the four volumes on the animal kingdom, vol. 1 is dedicated to quadrupeds, vol. 2 to birds, vol. 3 to fishes and amphibia, vol. 4 to insects; vol. 5, the first volume on the plant kingdom, deals with trees and bushes. Structured into numerous chapters and paragraphs, the content of the single books is easily accessible to the reader, not least because of the detailed table of contents at the beginning and an alphabetical index of names at the end of each volume. The index is ordered according to Latin names, but each lemma also offers Hungarian, Germanic and Slavic terms for the same animal or plant (often several variants; the different names are discussed at the beginning of the respective chapters as well). Although Großinger mentionsLinnaeus, he does not use his terminology.All volumes open with a short preface on the overarching topic of the volume, apart from the first volume, which starts with a lengthy introduction to the whole work. In this introduction, Großinger states that it is his aim to fill a publication gap, offering the first detailed description of the natural treasures of Hungary. He advertises his natural history as a contribution to the economy of Hungary and as good sourcebooks for teachers to make excerpts from for their classes, critising an exsisting school book as too sober and dry (vol. 1, p. 47–49).Indeed, the chapters of the monumental work are easily readable and interspersed with curiosities and anecdotes from literature, hearsay or his own experience. For example, in the chapter on the swan, the author mentions, among many other things, that the Russians ate swans, that Venus's chariot was drawn by four swans and that when the reformer Jan Hus was about to die, he prophesied that in one hundred years, a swan would rise that would never be consumed by fire (vol. 2, p. 145–9). Similarly, in the chapter on frogs, Großinger tells an anecdote about Hungarian school boys who at the beginning of spring found a bunch of frogs hiding in a hollow willow, killed and skinned them; however, on the following day, their hands were swollen (vol. 3, p. 310–1).Despite the many colourful stories, thehistoriais not illustrated with pictures of animals or plants. The only images are the beautiful frontispieces with simple two-line epigrams which feature in the first four volumes. In the fifth volume, this is reduced to the epigram only, which we find printed as a motto on the flyleaf. There is no indication in the fifth volume that the publishing process was about to end. In fact, the last sentence in the fifth volume makes a transition to the topic of the sixth volume, which would, however, remain in manuscript. One reason why the publication project was abandoned after the fifth volume might be the general decline of Neo-Latin literature at the end of the 18th century, which might have made the printing less profitable.

It was probably intended as an encyclopedia or a big table of contents in order to find the results in the respective works.The only notable exceptions are Book VI and, especially, Book VII concerned with optics; Mersenne seems to have printed the treatises of Walter Warner and Thomas Hobbes in their original form.The table of contents is followed by aDictionarium Mathematicumwhich in spite of its title is not a real dictionary but just an index of mathematical terms mentioned in the book without any explanations. Mersenne indicates that these terms are thosequae hoc secundo volumine continentur, which could probably mean that theSynopsiswas perceived as a follow-up to another of Mersenne's writing, namely theCogitata physica-mathematicapublished in the same year.",,"Mersenne, Marin‎(← links)Universae geometriae mixtaeque mathematicae synopsis et bini refractionum demonstratarum tractatus(redirect page) ‎(← links)","Mersenne, Marin:Universae geometriae mixtaeque mathematicae synopsis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Universae_geometriae_mixtaeque_mathematicae_synopsis(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,"OA, FB",Yes,"OA, FB",

The popularising nature of the publication is strongly marked on the Latin-German title page. Apart from the programmatic presentation of Urania, Muse of Astronomy, as propitious, the repeated use of ""easy"" (facilis/facillimus/leicht) catches the reader's eye immediately. In the Latin title, which offers more details than the German one, the advertised easiness is further specified bysine ulla logarithmorum mentione, indicating that this work of astronomical tables does not require knowledge about logarithms. In the preface to the work, Cunitz explains that the aim of her work is to lead readers to appreciate and praise Kepler's incomparible tables (ut lectores, fructu e meo compendio percepto, inciperet dictas tabulas, quibus [...] praestantiores a mundi exordio sol non vidit, digne aestimare et magnificare, p. 1–2, cf. p. 148 for the German version).Rather unusually for the time, thePropitious Uraniaoffers both a Latin (p. 1–145) and a German introduction (p. 147–265) to the following astronomical tables. The book thus addresses two different readerships at once: an international, Latin-educated readership and a German, non-Latin educated readership. The bilinguality of the work is justified by the author in a longer passage in the preface (p. 6, cf. p. 154 for the German version): Cunitz states that her motif was not to gain a little fame by striving for something new or by showing off her Latin (studio novitatis vel iactatione Latinismi), but that her patriotism (amor patriae) motivated her to write in German, making her work accessible to her compatriots, and necessity (necessitas) compelled her to write in Latin, making her work accessible to the international republic of letters; moreover, the Latin version is meant to protect her against unauthorised translations and plagiarism.Both the Latin and the German introduction to the astronomic tables contain 23 chapters, structured into three parts dealing with mathematical fundamentals and spherical astronomy (ch. 1–10), planetary motion (ch. 11–19) and eclipses (ch. 20–23) respectively, a structure that mirrors the one of the tables themselves. The three parts of the introduction and of the series of tables follow the model of Kepler'sTabulae Rudolphinae. However, Kepler includes a fourth part, namely a star catalogue, which has no counterpart in Cunitz' work. The concrete contents presented in both works differ as well. For instance, as promised in the title, Cunitz excludes logarithms which are omnipresent in Kepler's work, but were perceived as being forbiddingly difficult. This emphasizes Cunitz's attempt to gain a broader readership - in contrast to Kepler, who certainly wrote for specialists appreciating the saving of computational labour by the use of logarithms.Generally speaking, Cunitz does not translate, paraphrase or excerpt Kepler, but writes a text of her own from scratch – or rather two texts, because the Latin and German versions do not correspond to each other exactly: as the Latin text is tailored to a university-educated readership, it contains more theoretical passages, whereas the German version is more practical.The main body of the work is enveloped in a rich paratext consisting of a Latin dedication letter to Emperor Ferdinand III, a string ofLatin panegyric poemson Maria Cunitz and her work (including one Italian sonnet), a preface by Cunitz's husband Elias von Löwen (Latin and German) and the preface by Cunitz discussed above (also Latin and German).In a study on the readership of thePropitious Urania, Guentherodt identified five copies in which the printed text had been annoted by hand, testifying to the actual use of the book (cf.Guentherodt 1991, 324–8). In three cases, handwritten annotations were found only in the Latin part of the work, in two cases, both in the Latin and the German part, indicating that by the mid-17th century, Latin was still the primary language of scientific discourse. However, by writing in German, Cunitz also made a significant contribution to the development of German as a scientific language.",Guentherodt 1987;Guentherodt 1988;Guentherodt 1991;Swerdlow 2012,"Tabulae Rudolphinae‎(← links)Cunitz, Maria‎(← links)Mirantur patuli septem miracula mundi‎(← links)","Cunitz, Maria:Urania propitia, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Urania_propitia(last revision: 20.01.2022).","Is the similarity of the names of Maria Cunitia and Urania Propitia a coincidence?

Although he could include only stars visible to the naked eye (the telescope was invented only a few years later), the work contains no less than 1200 stars.The book is structured in a neat, orderly way that presumably contributed much to its success. Bayer seems to have transferred the uniform entries characteristic ofhistoriae plantarumandanimaliumto the sky. Each constellation is presented in the form of a one-page catalogue followed by a corresponding copper engraving (executed by Alexander Mair). The catalogue bears as its title all the names ever given to the respective constellation. This is followed by adiarthrosis(""dissection"", ""partition"") that lists the single stars in the order of their magnitude. Each star is signed with a Greek minuscule which recurs in the engraving (a system invented by Bayer and still in use today; sometimes, the Greek minuscules are supplemented by Latin majuscules and minuscules). If a star bears one or several names of its own, these are also given, otherwise its position within the constellation is indicated (e.g. θ Ursae Minoris isin genu sinistro anteriore, ""on the front side of the left knee""). The coppers provide fanciful, beautifully executed pictures of the constellation. If the respective figure is human, it is represented in ancient garb. A graticule ensures that every star's exact location on the sky (not indicated in the catalogue) appears at one glance. Tables 1-48 show the 48 Ptolemaic constellations, table 49 adds twelve constellations of the southern sky, tables 50–51 give overviews of the northern and southern hemispheres as a whole.As befits an ambitious and expensive book such as this, theUranometriafeatures a considerable number of introductory paratexts. The engraved title page shows, among other things, Nature in the guise of Cybele, flanked by Sol and Luna, as well as Atlas and Hercules, styled as the first teacher and pupil of astronomy respectively, and proudly dedicates the work to Eternity (AETERNITATI). In the letter of dedication to nine members of the municipal government of Augsburg, Bayer emphasizes the difficulties he, a jurist by profession, had to face in the composition of his astronomical work, extolls the usefulness of astronomy for human life and belittles the value of his achievement. The preface to the reader distinguishes astronomy (noble, pious) from astrology (base, superstitious), highlights the novelty of theUranometria, discusses the confusion reigning in the field of star nomenclature, to which he has reacted by adducing all the names known to him (Latin, Greek and oriental, good and bad alike), and finally provides some elementary instruction concerning the book's content and use. The rest, the reader is assured, he will easily find out for himself. Last not least, two Greek elegies and one Latin hexameter poem shower the author and his work with extravagant praise. The second elegy, for instance, asserts that Bayer was not born by a human woman, but by Urania, the Muse of astronomy, herself. May he live forever, immortal and ageless (ἀθάνατος ζῆσον καὶ ἀγήραος ἤματα πάντα, l. 13)!A facsimile edition of the work has been published in 2010.","Berberich 2010Hamel 2010Remmert 2011, 127–130 (on the frontispiece)","Bayer, Johann‎(← links)","Bayer, Johann:Uranometria, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Uranometria(last revision: 20.07.2023).",,"DB, MK",Yes,MK,

The dialogue recalls several ecstatic journeys made by Uranophilus, representing the author, and his guide Urania, the muse of the sky. On their way to different planets and celestial places, they meet Geonisbe, the muse of the Earth, and a dialogue about both their journeys and the developments on earth during their absence begins. The dialogue is situated in a “suburban Tusculum” in Salvador da Bahia, the capital of the Portuguese colonial province, where the author resides, which is described as heaven on Earth.The work was dedicated to Bernardo Vieira Ravasco, at the time secretary of state and military in the colonial province, who is appealed to as generous patron. After an instruction by Urania on canonical astronomical and cosmological knowledge, ten ecstatic journeys of differing length are described in different books, each with a new title page: I: to the Moon II: to Mercury III: to Venus IV: to the Sun V: to Mars VI: to Jupiter VII: to Saturn VIII: to the fixed stars IX: to the empyrean sphere (‘’caelum empyreum’’) X: to some imagined space. Of the three interlocutors, Geonisbe takes the stance of conservative natural philosophy, defending the old world system and the Aristotelian framework, while Urania explains and defends the new achievements of cosmology, represented by the Tychonic geoheliocentric system, which was an acceptable stance at the time from the view of the Society of Jesus.The style of the work is lively, vivid and sometimes even exuberant, using simile, an abundance of rhetorical questions, emotional wording and more. Urania and Geonisbe are oftentimes fighting quite harshly when defending their views of the cosmos. Numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary poets accompany the text, as well as quotes from prose authorities. Most of the time, citations for the quotes are indicated. Several marginalia per page give short summaries of crucial points.The topic and form are very similar to another ecstatic journey by a fellow member of the Society of Jesus,Athanasius Kircher’sItinerarium exstaticum, which was printed in Rome in 1656. Stansel and Kircher had met at the Collegio Romano at the time and continued to be in contact even when the former left for Salvador. Given the obvious similarities to Kircher’s work, we can assume that Stansel knew and emulated this text, even if he seems to try to avoid to do so openly. This was probably due to the highly ambivalent views on Kircher’s ‘’Itinerarium’’ even within the Society of Jesus (Camenietzki 2004, 317–318). Inspiration could also have come from earlier representatives of the genre, includingJohannes Kepler'sSomniumandLibert Froidmont’sSomnium sive peregrinatio caelestis.Stansel’s ideas about the cosmos resemble Kircher’s work in some respect when he does not usually give clear answers to the forces governing the universe, but concedes that not everything can be perceived by the human mind. He does, however, give his hypotheses after such claims, similar to what Kircher did in numerous of his publications.",Camenietzki 2004,"Stansel, Valentin‎(← links)","Stansel, Valentin:Uranophilus caelestis peregrinus, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Uranophilus_caelestis_peregrinus(last revision: 20.02.2023).",,"JL, IT",Yes,JL,

In the first one, titledNosologia(pp. 1–70), all diseases are divided intoclasses,ordines,genera, andspeciesaccording to theSynopsis nosologiae medicae(1785) of the Scottish physician William Cullen, and each disease is briefly defined in terms of its symptoms (e.g. p. 30,Chlorosis: dyspepsia, vel rei non esculentae desiderium; cutis pallor vel decoloratio; venae minus plenae, corporis tumor mollis; asthenia; palpitatio; menstruorum retentio).
Part 2, thePharmacopoeia(pp. 71–200), begins with two alphabetic lists of simple vegetal drugs, whose medical designations and botanical (or zoological) names are given in two columns, and of chemical drugs, whose French and English names are also given (pp. 73–106). This is followed by composite drugs and their recipes (pp. 107–149). A so-calledTabula posologica(pp. 152–163) informs on the dosage of each medicine. In a last subsection, the medicines (again with recipes) are ordered according to their effects (pp. 165–200). The book concludes with aContentorum index etimologicus, a table of contents whose ""etymologies"" are to a large part not etymologies in the modern sense, but simple explanations of meanings.Despite its sometimes shaky Latin, the handy, neatly arranged booklet, which consists entirely of lists, justifies Jefferson's praise.

It belongs to a well-established genre of astrological almanacs, which was popular throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and reached its peak in the sixteenth century. The features of Bonincontri's piece are mostly related to the personality of its author. Bonincontri was largely responsible for the revival of ancient astrological poetry in the Renaissance. He taught Manilius'Astronomicaat Studio Fiorentino and evidently sought to imitate it in his ambitiousDe rebus coelestibus. This contribution propelled Bonincontri's overall role and status within the humanist movement and his reputation among contemporaries. Alongside Giovanni Pontano of Naples, he is often believed to have been at the forefront of late fifteenth-century and early sixteenth-century poetic experiments particularly concerned with astrological matters.All these details are reflected in the present almanac. It is dedicated to a powerful patron, Cardinal Raffaele Riario, who is usually credited for having been the person who invited Michelangelo to Rome. The figure of the addressee and the place of publication are suggestive of Bonincontri's fame as an astrologer. In the meantime, probably to comply with the reader's expectations and justify his poetic reputation, Bonincontri preceded the main body of the text with a short poem focusing on one's desire to learn the future and the celestial signs with which God provided the observer and investigator. Its style and language clearly aim to imitate Manilius. The almanac outlines a handful of events, which could depend on the positions of the planets in the course of the year. At the end of the piece, Bonincontri appended a table of the days he considered fortunate on the basis of astrological calculations.

Twenty years after his very premature death, Horrocks’ Latin description of his observations was published in Gdánsk asVenus in sole . . . visaas an appendix to Hevelius’Mercurius in sole visus. Hevelius added his own notes to Horrocks’ observations throughout the text. As the first offering results of its kind, the work was received to much acclaim among Europe’s natural philosophers, especially from those in Britain, who were pleased to learn of such important work from one of their countrymen. Ten years later, in 1672, a second edition of Horrocks’ tract was published by the Royal Society in London as part of the author’sopera posthuma. Here it appears alongside the reports from William Crabtree, a friend and correspondent of Horrocks’, who also observed the Venus transit in 1639 from northwest England.Alongside Horrocks’ description of his observations—remarkable in themselves for being the first published—theVenus in sole visaalso offers four poems by Horrocks on 1) the telescope, 2) the planet Venus, 3) the Ptolemaic and Copernican world systems and 4) Kepler.

Hence, we hardly find any treatment of microscopic organisms in his systematic works like theSystema naturae. The Danish zoologist Otto Frederik Müller was the first to rectify this omission in the first volume of hisVermium terrestium et fluviatilium … historia.The work is dedicated toAlbrecht von Haller,Carolus Linnaeus, and Charles Bonnet. In thepraefatio, Müller defines the content of his systematic work. He is dealing withvermes, a term that basically used to comprise organisms that did not belong to any other traditional group of animals (mammalia, birds, reptiles, amphibia, fish, insects), a problematic approach as this group of animals was, hence, only definedex negativo, and there were characteristic common to all members of this group. Müller then goes on to describe more recent attempts to find a systematic order and divide this ‘paraphyletic’ taxon ofvermesinto better defined groups of animal species and that he will follow in his work. Included in the preface is also a pathetic passage on the creation, god as the creator, and the value of systematic biology to understand it. 
The preface is followed by the bibliography and an overview over the main classes and orders of his taxonomy together with a short characterisation. His work is ordered according to ascala naturaefrom the simplest (i.e., single-cell organisms) to more complex species. Each part on the respective classes is introduced by another text in which the main characteristics and theirhistoriais described. As is typical for systematic works, the descriptions of the single species are quite brief. Apart from binominal Latin names, Müller also mentions Danish, Swedish, German, English, and French synonyms (if there are any). Moreover, there are references to earlier descriptions and names. Although Müller’s work is an important attempt to classify the unspecific group ofvermes, it is not valid anymore as, for example, hisgens helminthicacomprises such different taxa as Tubulariidae, Hydridae, and Annelida.

This work, a Byzantine compilation of late antique hippiatric texts, presents itself as a mosaic of mostly short extracts from over a dozen authors. The extracts belong to various genres and text types (proems, letters, lists of symptoms, prescriptions of treatment, recipes etc.) and are presented thematically. The list of themes treated includes not only all kinds of diseases and injuries, but also topics such as parasites, copulation, abortion and furious behaviour.The translation, which comprises 120 folio pages, is introduced by a fair number of paratexts. After the title page showing the king on horseback, there follows a letter of dedication to the same, a list of the Greek authors who have contributed to the collection and an epigram in praise of Ruel by the famous Greek scholar Janus Lascaris. Next comes a very detailed table of contents and an extensive dictionary of the technical terms of hippology.Which manuscript Ruel translated from is unclear, but he could have obtained it from Lascaris. In any case, it was erroneously divided into two books, which is replicated in Ruel's version. (The error may have originated from a misunderstanding of Hesiod's saying that the beginning is already half of the whole, quoted at the beginning of the putative second book, see fol. 65v.) Ruel freely added supplementary material, esp. from the GreekGeoponika. The tendency to create a hippiatric 'encyclopaedia' that should be as complete as possible is in line with the utilitarian nature of the enterprise, which had no philological goal in the modern sense of the word, but aimed at helping all people who had to do with horses,  especially the king's armies: the letter of dedication calls the work abeneficiumformilites tuos ac mortales reliquos.Ruel stresses the difficulty of his task as translator in the letter of dedication when he calls theHippiatricaanopus … Laconica brevitate perstrictum, abditis difficultatibus scatens. In fact, the difficulties of the original and of the translation are nearly exclusively terminological, and in this respect, the reader is helped by the aforementioned dictionary.Given the largely practical nature of hippiatrics and the lack of institutional training back then, it is difficult to say who would actually have bought and studied the work. At the very least, however, it can be  considered successfull insofar as it prompted at least four further editions and translations, a Greek, an Italian, a French, and a German one, which were published in 1537, 1543, 1563, and 1575 respectively.","McCabe 2007, esp. 49–50","Ruel, Jean‎(← links)","Ruel, Jean:Veterinaria medicina, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Veterinaria_medicina(last revision: 22.07.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Sometimes, these (of course invariably eulogistic) obituaries were originally presented as orations. This is also true with respect to the present specimen. As the title of this obituary onDaniel Bernoulli(1700–1782) by his homonymous nephew indicates, it is a revised version (including inter alia some footnotes and a bibliography, see below) of a talk given on the 17th of March 1783, the first anniversary of the defunct's death (p. 1), at a reunion of the Societas Physico-Medica Basiliensis. In the preface to the entire volume, which is also edited by the nephew, the latter specifies that the talk has already been published separately (asVita immortalis viri Danielis Bernoulli, Basel 1783), but that this publication does not enjoy wide circulation (non admodum … divulgata, p. VI; in fact, it is quite difficult to find today). Therefore, he takes the opportunity to republish his funeral oration in theNova Acta Helvetica.The oration (pp. 1–26) starts with a proem in which the orator declares that he does not measure up to his task, as is customary on such occasions. After a short overview of the last generations of the Bernoulli family, which has already produced a number of brilliant mathematicians, the defunct's childhood and education, his early career and his years at the Academy of Saint Petersburg (late 1720s – early 1730s) are recounted. After that point, the narration gives way to an overview of various aspects of Bernoulli's success as a mathematician and physicist: his numerous wins in the annual prize competitions organised by the French Académie des Sciences, his correspondence with famous colleagues, visits paid to him, his membership in various learned societies and his professorships in Basel. After this, his good character (modesty, willingness to help, frugality etc.) is adumbrated and the narrative thread is resumed with an account of his old age and death. The oration concludes with an assessment of the loss suffered by the community and a final address to the defunct who now dwells in heaven. Appended to the talk, the reader finds a bibliography of the defunct's works (pp. 26–32).Due to the amount of detailed information it contains, theVita Danielis Bernoulliis a precious source for the great scientist's life and works. As such it has been used, for instance, by Georg Cantor in his respective article in theAllgemeine Deutsche Biographie(ADB 2, 1875, 478–480). Nonetheless, this oration is a panegyrical work which presents the reader with a carefully edited version of Bernoulli's biography. The highest praise is lavished on his life, intellect and character, and all darker aspects – for example his dislike of Saint Petersburg or his tense relationship with his father – are left out. The same holds, in the interest of general intelligibility, for anything too technical in the description of Bernoulli's mathematical, physical, technical and medical works (cf. e.g. p. 13 on his most important work, theHydrodynamica).In terms of form, the work's overall structure – family, youth and education, achievements, virtues, death – still fits quite well the precepts given by the Greek rhetorician Menander some 1500 years ago. The style is lofty, featuring classical vocabulary as far as possible and rolling Ciceronian periods. Young Daniel is styled as a second Hercules at the crossroads between commerce and science (p. 6), and his successes can be exalted in the words of Virgil. After he has won the first of his Académie des Sciences prizes, for instance, this is commented upon as follows:victorque noster virum volitavit per ora(""and our hero took victorious flight through the lips of men"", cf.Georgics3.9).",,"Bernoulli, Daniel (II)‎(← links)Elogium Rudolphi Augustini Vogel‎(← links)","Bernoulli, Daniel (II):Vita Danielis Bernoulli, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vita_Danielis_Bernoulli(last revision: 30.03.2021).","preface to whole vol., p. v: contributions are asked forLatine vel Gallice scriptaepp. 7–8 in 1721 Daniel Bernoulli writes and defends doctoral dissertationDe respiratione, which combines medicine and mathematics.prize essay were sent in anonymously, with asymbolum, e.g.Omnia conando docilis solertia vincit(p. 17).",MK,Yes,MK,

As such, theNova litterariamainly addressed a foreign readership, as explained in the preface to their first volume. Like many early modern journals, they were written and compiled by one single man, and they were short-lived (1718–1723).Among the various kinds of articles published in this journal, obituaries for learned men have a fixed place. Such brief, more or less laudatory overviews of a person's life and works were written in much greater numbers than formal biographies in early modern times (as is still the case today). The present example, devoted to the famous English astronomerJohn Flamsteed, is a typical specimen of this large class of texts.After the initial information about Flamsteed's death, the short obituary falls into three parts: a sketch of Flamsteed's birth, youth and career, which culminated in his position as Astronomer Royal and his work at Greenwich Observatory, which he had helped to found; an overview of his writings, focussing on his monumentalHistoria coelestis Britannica, which was still unpublished in 1720 and whose content is therefore summarised in extenso; and some information about Flamsteed as a man, for example about his age at death, small stature, love of coffeehouses and abhorrence of women. This clear thematic structure as well as the topics themselves reflect a biographical pattern that ultimately goes back to theTwelve Caesarsof the Roman polymath Suetonius and can be observed in many funeral orations and obituaries for intellectuals in the 18th century (cf.Korenjak; Schaffenrath; Subaric; Töchterle 2012, 949–950). Equally typical of the age and genre is Krause's sober and factual tone. Although Flamsteed'sindustriaand his dedication to his work (as well as the commitment of King Charles II to the sciences) are given due praise (pp. 13, 17), Krause primarily tries to provide as much pertinent information as possible about the man and his work and in particular to familiarise the reader with the astronomer's above-mentionedopus magnum.",,"Historia coelestis Britannica‎(← links)Krause, Johann Gottlieb‎(← links)","Krause, Johann Gottlieb:Vita Flamstedii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vita_Flamstedii(last revision: 19.04.2021).",RECENSIO,MK,Yes,MK,

In its form and function, it may be called a classical author's biography, comparable to texts such as Samuel Sorbière'sDe vita et moribus Petri Gassendior Herman Boerhaave'sVita Ioannis Swammerdammii. The structure and content of the short work are loosely inspired by Suetonius, whose biographies are divided into a chronological and a descriptive part, and by the ancient personal encomium, whose main topics are the origin, upbringing, virtues, occupations, accomplishments, personal circumstances and death of the person in question (Lausberg 1990, § 376). Ghymm starts from Mercator's homeland and family and gives the reader a short sketch of his youth and his studies (fol. †r), before turning to his works. Mercator's geo- and cosmographical books, maps and globes are described extensively (fol. †r–v), while his theological and chronographical writings are treated more cursorily (fol. †v–†2r). At the end of the works section, the original plan of the present Atlas, which Mercator did not live to realise, is outlined (fol. †2r). The next longer section is devoted to Mercator's family, that is, to his wife, three sons and three daughters as well as their offspring (fol. †2r–v). Before and after, some of Mercator's virtues are highlighted, for instance his affability and industriousness (fol. †2r, †2v). It is emphasised that he had a large circle of friends, not only in Duisburg, where he spent most of his life, but also in Europe at large and beyond (one of his correspondents used to write to him from Goa). Moreover, this circle comprised a number of personalities of high rank (fol. †2v–†3r). Finally, some remarks about Mercator's bodily constitution lead to an account of his old age, illnesses and death (fol. †3r).Dominus Deus illi largiatur laetissimam resurrectionem in die iudicii(""May God the Lord grant him a most happy resurrection on the Day of Judgement"") is Ghymm's final wish for his friend.Ghymm manages to compress a lot of information into the five folio pages of his biography. For this reason, his text still is an important source for Mercator's life today. Each sentence is packed with detail, as exemplified by the very first lines:Gerardus Mercator, illustrissimi principis Iuliae, Cliviae, Montis etc. cosmographus longe exercitatissimus, editus est in lucem anno millesimo quingentesimo duodecimo, quinta Martii, sub auroram, hora sexta, a parentibus Iuliacensibus, videlicet Huberto Mercatore et Emerentiana eiusdem uxore, Rupelmundae in finibus comitatus Flandriae, apud illius patruum Gisbertum Mercatorem, eiusdem oppidi pastorem vigilantissimum commorantibus.Gerhard Mercator, the extremely experienced cosmographer of the most serene prince of Jülich-Cleves-Berg etc., came into the world on March 5th of the year 1512, at dawn around six o'clock, as the son of parents from Jülich, namely Hubert Mercator and his wife Emerentiana, during a stay at Rupelmonde in the territory of the County of Flanders, in the house of his paternal uncle Gisbert Mercator, the most vigilant minister of this rural town.As this example also exemplifies, Ghymm writes quite expansive but syntactically not overly complex sentences. Their length is rather due to the paratactical juxtaposition of elements and to appositions. His Latin is neat and comparatively sober, praise being mostly conveyed by superlative forms. More pathetic expressions such as exclamations and rhetorical questions occur as well, but they are comparatively rare.",Geske 1962,"Atlas sive Cosmographicae meditationes‎(← links)Ghymm, Walter‎(← links)Geske 1962‎(← links)","Ghymm, Walter:Vita Gerardi Mercatoris, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vita_Gerardi_Mercatoris(last revision: 23.09.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Completed in 1735 in Leiden, the biography was written by the editor Herman Boerhaave specifically for this monumental publication of Swammerdam’s work. In this literary text, Swammerdam's life and scientific discoveries and publications are presented in chronological order (starting with a short account of Swammerdam's family, i.e. grandfather and father, which is typical for the genre). The last four and a half pages of the biography are dedicated to the fate of Swammerdam's manuscripts which Boerhaave eventually secured, prepared for edition and used to reconstruct Swammerdam's working method. This leads to an emphatic praise of Swammerdam as a true Baconian scientist. The biography covers Swammerdam's character and personal life, his academic friendships and working conditions, scientific discoveries and publications. Boerhaave describes Swammerdam's scientific achievements in great detail. Much room is devoted to Swammerdam's love for insects, his struggle with his father over his studies and his later inner conflict between his scientific activity and the demands of piety.Swammerdam's biography is a lively and stylistically rich text as is evidenced for instance in the following intriguing passage in which the tireless fascination for insects of the young Swammerdam is expressed in terms of stunningly long enumerations (fol. A2v):Aerem, aquas, terras, agros, campos, pascua, sata, inculta, colles arenarios, ripas, litora, flumina, stagna, puteos, lacus, maria, arbores, plantas, rudera, specus, loca habitata, foricas perscrutabatur, ut ova, vermes, nymphas, papiliones indagaret, horumque nidos, alimenta, mores, morbos, mutationes, copulas addisceret.(""He searched air, water, earth, farmland, fields, pastures, sown and fallow land, dunes, river banks, shores, rivers, ponds, wells, lakes, seas, trees, plants, heaps of stones, caves, populated areas and latrines in order to investigate eggs, larvae, pupae and butterflies and learn in addition about their nests, food, behaviour, illnesses, transformations and mating."")In the mid 18th centuryGermanandEnglisheditions of theBiblia naturae, Boerhaave's biography of Swammerdam was translated into the respective vernacular, but printed both times without the Latin version.",,"Boerhaave, Herman‎(← links)Biblia naturae‎(← links)Vita Gerardi Mercatoris‎(← links)","Boerhaave, Herman:Vita Ioannis Swammerdammii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vita_Ioannis_Swammerdammii(last revision: 23.06.2021).","Another example is the grand rhetorical passage at the end of the biography, in which Swammerdam's scientific achievements are contrasted with the loss of Swammerdam's insects and scientific instruments that had been sold after Swammerdam's death, a contrast that is highlighted with an anaphora and an ensuing series of rhetorical exclamations (fol. I1v):Tale quid a cognitis disciplinarum fatis numquam factum fuit. Tale quid in saeculum durabile potuisset servari.

Printed in the year of Finé's death together with acollectionof 26 funerary poems in Latin, Greek, and French by various authors, the 100 verses longVita Orontii(Life of Oronce) is in fact a cross-over of a funerary poem, encomium and biography. However, as in his laterEncomium docti astronomi(Encomium of the Learned Astronomer), Mizauld does not use the obvious form of an elegy in alternating hexameters and pentameters, but chooses a rather unusual metre, this time the iambic senar.The framework of Mizauld's poem stems from the literary genre of the funerary epigram in which frequently, a passer-by is invited to stop at the tomb and learn who is buried there. While the speaker of the epigram is often the deceased or the monument, in this case, it is the poet Mizauld that informs the passer-by about his teacher and friend Oronce Finé. Following about 15 verses on Oronce's origin, education, marriage and children, the heart of the poem is dedicated to the praise of Finé's character and achievements. At the end, Mizauld laments Finé's death and says farewell to the passer-by (i.e. the reader). A short text in maiuscules, perhaps imitating a funerary inscription, follows the poem, naming the place, date and hour of Oronce's death, his age and the place of his tomb.The poem is easy to read and clearly structured due to a sort of refrain that reappears three times in slightly variated versions and mark the transitions between the parts delineated above:Ille est Orontius, ille Orontius meuspraeceptor, hospes carus ac amicus bonus,qui hoc in tumulo dormit, sepultus ibi iacet.""That man is Oronce, that Oronce is my teacher, dear host and good friend, who sleeps in this tomb, lies buried there"".As the titleLife of Oronce, Expressed in Few Wordssuggests, this is not a full-fledged biography, but instead evokes a certain image of Oronce Finé. Although Mizauld highlights Oronce's role in the restauration and teaching of mathematics in Paris (Ci v–Cii r), his being a mathematician is not in the focus of the poem. Rather, Oronce is portrayed as someone who embodies the virtues of theres publica literaria, for instance regarding his wit, his work ethics or his ""Socratic"" constancy.",,"Encomium docti astronomi‎(← links)Mizauld, Antoine‎(← links)Funebre symbolum‎(← links)De mundi sphaera‎(← links)","Mizauld, Antoine:Vita Orontii, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vita_Orontii(last revision: 07.09.2021).",The portrait seems to be of a member of the res publica litteraria who happens to be a mathematician.The collection includes a bibliography of Finé at the end.,"MK, IT",Yes,IT,

A document of humanist patriotism, the monumental collection of biographies describes the lives and works of more than 500 (mostly) German scholars (""German"" was understood broadly to include Dutch and Flemish scholars as well). It was printed between 1615 and 1620 in five volumes: philosophers (1615), physicians, lawyers and politicians, theologians (all 1620), and theologians from abroad (1618). The structure of the biographical work thus mirrors the structure of the university.In all volumes, the biographies are arranged in chronological order according to the date of death (no living scholars are included). In writing the biographies, Adam summarized and paraphrased funeral eulogies, earlier biographies, letters, literary histories and other sources, drawing from the rich collection of the Heidelberg library. The sources are usually cited at the end of a biography. While Adam’s work is not the first biographical collection of scholars, it stands out because of the richness in detail, the clear disposition of an enormous wealth of material and the stylistic harmonisation of heterogenous sources (Seidel 2000).The collection of biographies shows that although the category ""scientist“ did not exist, scholars that are now considered scientists had a firm place within the realm of learning. Biographies of mathematicians are placed in the volume on philosophers, where one can find the lives ofJohannes Regiomontanus,Nicolaus Copernicus,Petrus ApianandGerhard Mercatoramong others. Biographies of physicians are collected in a book of its own.TheLives of German Physiciansbrings together more than 120 biographies, spanning from Peter Raichspalt (†1320) to Johann Ingolstetter (†1619), in a biographical dictionary of 451 pages. Depending on the richness or scarceness of the source material, the length of the single biographies varies considerably: the shortest ones are about one page long, while the longest cover more than 20 pages. The majority of lives, however, does not comprise more than ten pages: only about ten biographies are longer, with the most extensive ones dedicated toConrad Gessner(p. 146–172), Joachim Curaeus (p. 197–216) andJohannes Crato(p. 261–277).The biographies are written in an elegant and, especially in the longer entries, vivid and engaging style, describing the life, work and virtues of the respective physician. They often include epitaphs and poems by or about the protagonist, as well as excerpts from letters and other sources. A chronological and an alphabetical index of names, a index rerum and rich marginalia provide guidance through the book.In 1705/06, theLives of German Physicianswere printed again inDignorum laude virorum, quos Musa vetat mori, immortalitas(The Immortality of Praiseworthy Men, whom the Muse forbids to die), a folio edition of Adam's five-part collection of biographies.","Seidel 2000,Almási 2019, 595–603","Adam, Melchior‎(← links)Memoriae medicorum nostri seculi clarissimorum renovatae decas‎(← links)","Adam, Melchior:Vitae Germanorum medicorum, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vitae_Germanorum_medicorum(last revision: 02.02.2022).",Adam cites panegyric poems in his biographies!,IT,Yes,IT,

In strong contrast to its obscure publication setting, it seems to be the first real early modern medical dictionary to appear in print.The work is introduced by a brief dedication to Symphorien's brother Christophe, who apparently used to mark difficult terms in his medical reading and finally asked Symphorien to explain them (mones, frater carissime, ut istaec, quae annotasti vocabula, paucis explanarem). Symphorien is sorry that in doing so, he has had no time to peruse the classical authors once more, since the correct understanding of a word's meaning largely depends on its context (verba pro loco et contextu esse declaranda). The dedication concludes with a few remarks on etymological relations, which testify to an interest in this aspect which resurfaces in the entries themselves. (A later example of a medical dictionary in which etymology has become the very focus of interest is provided by theLexicon medicum etymologicum).The dictionary itself comprises about one hundred pages and some 800 entries. Its alphabetical order extends to the first letter only. Lemma words pertain to nosology, anatomy, physiology, materia medica, therapy, natural philosophy and various other aspects of early modern medicine. The length of the single entries varies between a few words and over one page. They are mostly written in full sentences beginning with the respective lemma word. The Latin is terse, syntactically simple and usually easy to understand. An entry typically starts from an explanation of the term in question, which may include a Latin translation (in the case of a Greek word), an intralinguistic etymology (in the case of a Latin one), related words and exemplary sentences. This is followed by factual information about the respective object or notion. Sometimes, no explanations regarding the expression itself are given, only its meaning and implications are discussed, as in the entry onDispositio naturalis(fol. [d viii v]). Ancient and Arabic authors like Hippocrates and Avicenna, but also poets such as Plautus and Juvenal are occasionally quoted. Generally speaking, the entries are quite diverse, and it is difficult to find one which can count as typical. As a short, simple example the entryPollexmay be adduced (fol. [g vi v]).Pollex vocatur, quod ceteris potentior sit. Pollere enim posse est. Unde pollentia potentia. Primus igitur in manu digitus pollex vocatur.The thumb (pollex) is called thus because it is more powerful (potentior) than the other [fingers]. For ""to be powerful"" (pollere) means ""to be able"" (posse). Therefore ""power"" (pollentia) means ""might"" (potentia). For this reason, the first finger in the hand is called ""thumb"" (pollex.)The work is distinguished by a carefully crafted layout. Each entry starts on a new line and with a paragraph sign and a marginal note repeating the lemma word (which is not itself set apart typographically from the rest of the entry). Longer entries may also be subdivided by marginalia. In this way, the lexicon becomes overseeable and easy to consult in spite of its lack of full alphabetisation, gothic script and numerous abbreviations.",,"Champier, Symphorien‎(← links)","Champier, Symphorien:Vocabulorum medicinalium epitoma, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Vocabulorum_medicinalium_epitoma(last revision: 10.01.2022).",,MK,Yes,MK,

Generally speaking, book 1 is on linear, book 2 on quadratic and book 3 on cubic problems. The indeterminate problems of book 4 and 5 are mostly taken from Diophantos'sArithmetica. All books are divided in the problems (zetetica), where the structure of the problems is usually as follows (using the notions ofOaks 2018, 277–278):In the ""enunciation"" the problem is formulated rhetorically. The ""setting-out and goal"" gives names to given quantities (B, D, etc.) and the sought quantity is recalled. The next part is the ""Zetetics"", that is the finding of an equation between the given and the sought magnitudes and the following explicit expression of the unknown (or its square or cube). This formula is then translated into a rhetoric sentence in the step of the ""Poristics"". The ""rhetic"" or ""exegetic"" step finally plugs in numerical values for given quantities and determines the unknowns in this particular example.These parts of handling problems are also made visible by different typesetting (the ""enunciation"" is printed in larger types, the ""poristic"" step in italics, the ""exegetic"" one in small letters).Viète therefore demonstrates the power of his new method and gives at the same time a step-by-step introduction.","Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography 2008, vol. 14, 20–21Oaks 2018, esp. 276–279van der Waerden 1980, 64–65","In artem analyticem isagoge‎(← links)Viète, François‎(← links)","Viète, François:Zeteticorum libri quinque, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Zeteticorum_libri_quinque(last revision: 22.02.2022).",,FB,Yes,FB,

The work provides a good example of the problems surrounding the authorship of academic dissertations. The title page names Johann Heinrich as sole author but this is not true, if one believesJohann Jakob Scheuchzer(and their is little reason not to do so) who claims in his autobibliographyAcarnaniathat neither Johann Heinrich nor Solomon but he himself is the main author, albeit with some assistance by the defendant (quamvis haud diffitear aliqua etiam defendentem meo labori addidisse; first ed., p. 119, second ed., p. 612). The date of printing provides a small problem as well, as the 18 January indicated on the title page refers to thedisputatio. As dissertations were printed before they were disputed, the work must have appeared either in late 1697 or in the first days of 1698.The text comprises 44 quarto pages. It features no preliminary paratexts apart from the title page but there is a folded-in table with at least 17 illustrations (only partly visible in the digital copy) at the beginning and a brief, informal valediction at the end, in which Johann Heinrich asks the reader to forgive his errors and promises better works ""when my studies and years will come of age"" (maturascentibus studiis et annis). The crystals named in the title basically refer to the mineral known as quartz (silicon dioxide) today, in particular to its most attractive form, rock crystal. The dissertations falls into eight chapters devoted to the following issues: I. names of the mineral (pp. 1–3); II. itsgenus, that is, the class of substances to which it belongs (p. 3); III. 17 phenomena observable in crystals, many of which are in fact simple properties like habitat, size, or colour (pp. 3–10); IV. hypotheses of ancient and recent authors, which basically regard the material and efficient causes of the mineral, and the speaker's ""modest judgment"" (modesta ἐπίκρισις) on them (pp. 10–19); V.solutiones, that is, explanations as well as further remarks on the 17 phenomena from ch. III (pp. 19–39); VI. the medical use of crystals (pp. 39–40); VII. their use in crafts and magic (pp. 41–42); VIII. their habitats (pp. 42–44). Chapters III.–V. form the work's core and comprise over 80% of its total length.That Johann Heinrich Hottinger is often called the first Swiss crystallogist in the modern sense of the word (see, for instance, theHistorisches Lexikon der Schweiz s.v.) is misleading not only because he is not the main author of theΚΡΥΣΤΑΛΛΟΛΟΓΙΑbut also because the latter is not really a work of science. Although the speaker occasionally invokes his own experience (whether this experience be Hottinger's or Scheuchzer's), the work's overall aim rather is to provide something like a (mildly) critical overview of the learned tradition. This is the case even in chapters III. and V., which look most scientific at first glance, as the phenomena discussed and their ""solutions"" are mainly taken from previous literature. The titles and pertinent passages of the respective works are cited quite precisely, although in heavily abbreviated form, and lengthy quotations – mostly in Latin, but also in Greek and German – abound: all in all, they account for about half of the work's length.The authors' own style combines scholastic and neo-scholastic terminology, in particular many abstract nouns, with a certain literary ambition, which manifests itself in metaphoric expressions and extended, complex periods, as in the following extract (ch. V, p. 19):Manum autem ex hisce difficultatibus nos extricandi porrigere mihi videtur sororia artis et naturae cognatio, id est crystallisationem naturalem per chymicam commode illustrari, immo explicari posse, cum ex paritate effectus iure inferatur identitas vel saltem cognatio causae, sicut iam olim Aretinus et alii exemplo aluminis, nitri etc., quae post coctionem evaporato humido a terrestri materia in angulosas superficies congelantur, probare annisus est, citante Boët. de Boot. p. 41.But the sisterly relation of art and nature seems to me to thrust out a hand to worm ourselves out of these difficulties, by which I mean that natural crystallization can conveniently be elucidated and even explained by chemical crystallization since from the sameness of the effect the identity or at least the affinity of the cause is rightly inferred, as already some time ago Aretinus [unidentified] and others made an effort to prove with the example of alum, niter and so on, substances which solidify into angulated surfaces when the humid stuff has evaporated from the earthly matter after cooking, in which sense [Anselm] Boët[hius] de Bodt cites them on p. 41 [of hisGemmarum et Lapidum Historia, second ed. 1636].",Niggli 1946(German translation),,"Scheuchzer, Johann Jakob; Hottinger, Johann Heinrich:ΚΡΥΣΤΑΛΛΟΛΟΓΙΑ seu Dissertatio de crystallis, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/ΚΡΥΣΤΑΛΛΟΛΟΓΙΑ_seu_Dissertatio_de_crystallis(last revision: 23.08.2021).",,MK,Yes,MK,

In the prefatory epistle addressed to Johann Baptist Hainzel, a young student who could profit from reading the book, Dasypodius presents his work as the concise basic introduction that mathematics has lacked so far. As the bilingual title suggests, the lexicon is presented both in a Latin (fols. 1–47) and in a Greek version (with the folio numbers starting from 1 again, fols. 1–42). The lexicon is structured by disciplines. Each chapter starts with a definition and subdivision of the mathematical discipline in question and continues with an introduction to the basic vocabulary of the respective field. The definitions  are not given in alphabetical order, but in the order inherent in the subject matter. For example, arithmetic starts with ""one"" as the principle of every number (unitas est principium omnis numeri). This didactic structure is complemented by an alphabetical index in Latin and Greek at the beginning of the book. A short Greek scholium to Euclid is attached to the Greek lexicon, making up for the difference in length.Dasypodius'Mathematical Lexicon or Dictionarymay have been inspired by a broadly similar work by Heron, whose translation, titledHieronis Alexandrini nomenclatura vocabulorum geometricorum, precedes it in a later edition of 1579. In any case, Dasypodius's work was among the first mathematical lexica to be published.

"De Rycke, Josse","Urbano VIII pontifici optimo maximo, cum accuratior ΜΕΛΙΣΣΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ a Lynceorum academia in perpetuae devotionis symbolum ipsi offerretur",,1625,Rome,"Greuter, Matthias (engraver)",17th century,"Panegyric poem, Other (see description)",Biology,ΜΕΛΙΣΣΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ (Melissographia),not available,"TheAccademia dei Lincei(“Academy of the Lynx-Eyed”), founded by Federico Cesi in 1603, was the first academy devoted to the natural sciences, their emblem and name giver being the lynx, an animal famous for its sharp-sightedness. The most renowned member of this Roman Academy wasGalileo Galilei, who fundamentally changed the perception of the universe through his astronomicalobservations with the telescope. However, the sharp-eyedLinceiwere pioneers in observing nature with the microscope, too: In 1625, they made the “first printed illustration in the history of natural history to have been made with the aid of a microscope” (Freedberg 2002, 161). This illustration, an impressive large-format engraving on a single sheet (41,6 x 30,7 cm) made by Matthias Greuter, is carefully crafted to promote the first microscopic observations by theLincei– as well as the academy in general – to Maffeo Barberini,pope Urban VIII.As a piece of promotion of science, the engraving consists of an interesting cross-over of heraldic and scientific representation: it presents the pope with the three Barberini bees of his coat of arms, but they are depicted according to how they look under the microscope. Each of the three bees offers a different view (topside, underside, side-view), with further depictions of anatomic details of the bee engraved on a band of parchment at the bottom of the page. These microscopic details surround a Latin panegyric poem in the centre of the parchment (the bee's leg even forms an attractive ornamental line below the text). Like the microscopic observation of the bee, which were done by Francesco Stelluti, the poem is also the work of a member of theAccademia dei Lincei, the Flemish philologist and poet Josse de Rycke.The poem consists of eight elegiac couplets, praising microscopy through the lense of the Barberini bee: the pope is invited to look at his heraldic animal as it has been observed and depicted by theLincei. In v. 11-13, the poem seems to morph into a microscope itself, describing four new details of the bee's anatomy that have been discovered by microscopic observation, like their lion-like mane. The new art of microscopy is advertised as revealing the greatest miracles (v. 9) and divine discoveries (v. 14), and the sacred work of theLincei(v. 7) especially is presented as inspired by the genius of the Cesi and assisted by Pallas’s art (i.e. the microscope). The engraving, together with the epigram, is an impressive testament to the potential of theLincei’s sharp-sighted observations, which is exemplified in the promotion of the Barberini bee of pope Urban VIII on the occasion of the Jubilee year of 1625.The engraving – connected to Federico Cesi’sApiariumon the anatomy of bees, which was printed one year later – survives only in a few copies. As this very target-specific form of promotion already suggests, the sheet seems to have been presented only to a select number of addressees: the primary addressee is, of course, Pope Urban VIII, but copies of the MΕΛΙΣΣΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ were also presented as diplomatic gifts to Archduke Leopold of Austria and Landgrave Louis V of Darmstadt (cf.Brevaglieri 2015, 146–9).","Critical online edition;Freedberg 2002, 160–3;Finocchiaro 2004;Guardo 2004;Brevaglieri 2015, 146–9","De Rycke, Josse‎(← links)Apiarium‎(← links)Microscopium‎(← links)","De Rycke, Josse:ΜΕΛΙΣΣΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ (Melissographia), in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/ΜΕΛΙΣΣΟΓΡΑΦΙΑ_(Melissographia)(last revision: 22.02.2022).","According to secondary literature, this engraving seems to feature the first public mention of the term ""microscope"".",DB,,IT,

The plants contained in it are as a rule not described but only adduced with the name given them by Bauhin and a list of synonyms from ancient, medieval and early modern authors. Thus, the work may be called an encyclopedic dictionary of synonyms. It aims at ordering the Babylonian confusion of tongues that reigned in early modern botany.In twelve books (a number that carries associations of perfection and exhaustiveness) and on c. 600 pages printed in small font and in two columns, the work lists some 6000 different plants. The first ten books deal with herbs, while books 11 and 12 are dedicated to shrubs and trees. Overall, Bauhin applies an Aristotelian order, as he starts from the 'simplest' plants, that is, plants without seeds, and then proceeds to more 'developed' ones. The books are divided into sections, each of which is devoted to one or several groups of plants sharing a number of morphological features. Most interestingly in the light of later developments, these groups, which are given a common name (e.g.Sparganium, p. 15), are subdivided further into smaller unities with the help of one or several adjectives (Sparganium ramosum,Sparganium non ramosum,Sparganium minimum). Thus, Bauhin appears as a precursor of the Linnean system, in which genera are subdivided into species in the very same way (the rook, for example, which belongs to the genusCorvus, is characterized by the addition of the adjectivefrugilegus) (cf.Meier Reeds 1991, 132).As befits an opus magnum like this on which a leading botanist has spent forty years of his life (as the title proudly announces), the book features a rich paratextual apparatus: a dedication to Adam Zorn of Strasbourg, apraefatioto the reader, six epigrams by friends of Bauhin, a list of the works used and cited, and a list of persons who have sent specimens of plants and seeds to Bauhin. Most importantly in terms of usability, the work concludes with an exhaustive index of plant names.","Slaughter 1982, 57–58Atran 1990, 135–38Meier Reeds 1991, 125–27","Bauhin, Caspar‎(← links)","Bauhin, Caspar:ΠΙΝΑΞ (Pinax) theatri botanici, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/ΠΙΝΑΞ_(Pinax)_theatri_botanici(last revision: 20.02.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,DB,

In the dedicatory letter to Cardinal Marco Antonio Colonna, the author makes clear that this is his first work (Excipe igitur, obsecro, ingenii mei primitias). In the following letter to the reader, Fabio Colonna, praises the study of plants asmateria medicaand explains the origin of this work. The author himself suffered from epilepsy and other illnesses. Therefore, he studied ancient medical texts by Hippocrates, Galen, and others to check if their treatments could corroborate the prescriptions of his own doctors. Then, there is a poem by a certain Franciscus Maurus Maidensis in elegiac couplets addressing the reader and praising Colonna’s work.The work on plants comprises 120 pages of which several pages are devoted to each plant. Colonna discusses that names and their etymology, the outward appearance, blooming period, habitat, and medical properties. The work is probably the first to feature an engraving of each plant discussed that allows for more details than a woodcut. Colonna’s main source text is Dioscorides’ workmateria medicafrom which he frequently cites. Longer Greek passages are also translated. Colonna then discusses these ancient descriptions and compares them to other texts (both ancient and early modern), and also to his own observations. Hence, Colonna proposes quite a few corrections. References to Colonna’s sources are printed in the margins. 
The work on plants is followed by an appendix of four kinds of ‘fish’, or rather any aquatic animals (Rhinobatos, a kind of ray, a kind of sea star, barnacles), and of eight plant species with new pagination (32 pages) and another short letter to the reader. In this letter, Colonna explains that he did not want to disturb the order of his book on plants with the new information on plants that he has gathered during the editing and printing process and therefore adds them in the end. He also proposes to include further information in either a planned commentary on Dioscorides or – if this is not going to happen – in another edition of the present work.
The first entry of the part on ‘fish’ is on theRhinobatos(guitarfish) to which Franciscus Maurus contributed another poem in four elegiac couplets, but this time in Greek. There is also another Greek epigram at the end dedicated to Colonna by a Jesuit named Francisco Guerrieri (Οὐερριήριος).

He highlights the difficulties of this task, such as to find good sources, to have a sound knowledge on the topic, and to find the right balance. Such work is, however, very important as the language must be “cleaned” from exotic (i.e., Arabic) and vulgar terms and he encourages experts of other disciplines to undertake this task as well. It should serve the education of young men. Moreover, Brunfels highlights thatLeonhart Fuchsis preparing a new edition of thePandectae medicinae, which he eagerly awaits.Apart from this letter to the reader, there are a few other paratexts. There is a table of anatomical terms (Tabula nominum anatomiae) listing Greek terms together with their Latin translation ordereda capite ad calcem. This is followed by a similarly structured catalogue of diseases (Cathalogus omnium aegritudinum, quae fere accidunt homini a capite usque ad pedes, quorum interpretationem require in Lexico sequenti); this time without translations as these can be found in the lexicon. Moreover, there is an overview of measurements by Saladin and a list of quotations of Galen (translated into Latin), in which he seems to state that people should rather concentrate on the facts and not quarrel about names.The lexicon itself is ordered alphabetically and offers Latin and Greek lemmata together with a short explanation and links to references (mostly of ancient texts). As already indicated in the title, it consists of a very broad spectrum of medical terms comprisinginter aliaanatomy, diseases, differentmateria medica, medical instruments, cures, etc.The work was reprinted in Strasbourg twice, in 1543 and 1553 (Tonelli 1971, 11).",,"Brunfels, Otto‎(← links)Dictionarium medicum‎(← links)","Brunfels, Otto:Ὀνομαστικόν medicinae, in: Noscemus Wiki, URL:http://wiki.uibk.ac.at/noscemus/Ὀνομαστικόν_medicinae(last revision: 10.01.2022).",,"DB, MK",Yes,DB,
